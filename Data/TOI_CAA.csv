Shaheen Bagh News: Man fires two rounds in air in Shaheen Bagh area; taken into custody | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Two days after a youth fired a pistol at a group of anti-CAA protesters near the Jamia university, another man on Saturday fired two rounds in the air at Shaheen Bagh, the epicentre of the protest against the country's new citizenship law, and was later taken into custody. No one was injured in the incident that came even as Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath during a poll rally in Delhi's northwest Rohini area alleged that those who support terrorists in Kashmir are staging protest at Shaheen Bagh. The man, who identified himself as Kapil Gujjar, chanted ‘Jai Shree Ram‘ and said, ""hamare desh me aur kisi ki nahi chalegi, sirf Hindu ki chalegi (only Hindus shall have a say in our country, no one else),"" as he was taken into custody by the Delhi Police. ""The accused fired in air near police barricades. He was overpowered by police personnel and taken into custody. Further investigation is on,"" Chinmoy Biswal, Deputy Commissioner of Police (southeast) said. The police said they are verifying his identity. According to eyewitnesses, the man shouted ""Hindu Rashtra Zindabad"" and fired two rounds. The incident, which comes days after a local contractor armed with a gun had come to the site and asked the people to end the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, has triggered panic in the area. A woman protestor, who didn't wish to be named, said the incident has created panic among them as well as children. ""Many women and children were inside the tent when the incident occurred. We rushed to the spot after hearing a gunshot. Everyone is scared. But we won't leave the spot,” she said. Notwithstanding the unnerving incident, many people thronged the protest site to express solidarity with the protestors. Many of them sung the national anthem while others offered namaz there. The protestors also raised slogans against the Delhi Police. Abu Ala Suhani, a publisher and resident of Shaheen Bagh said,""the man appeared to be in his 20s and fired two rounds. While he was being taken into custody, we heard a policeman asking him his name. The man said his name was Kapil Gujjar and he belongs to Dallupura village in Uttar Pradesh."" On Thursday, the youth had fired on anti-CAA protesters at Jamia Millia Islamia injuring a student in the presence of police personnel, triggering massive protest by the Jamia students against the police inaction. Hundreds of people, including women and children, have been protesting since December 15 at Shaheen Bagh, which has attracted attention across the country among those opposing the CAA, but at the same time the agitation has been severely criticised by others, including the BJP Union ministers and leaders. Hitting out at the AAP dispensation, Adityanath said that the Arvind Kejriwal government ""supplies biryani"" to protesters at Shaheen Bagh. Addressing another poll rally at Karawal Nagar Chowk in east Delhi, the BJP leader lashed out at the anti-CAA protesters, saying ""their ancestors divided India, so they have a grouse against this emerging 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'."" ""These protests happening at various places in Delhi are not about the CAA, but it is happening because those people are questioning as to how can India emerge as a major power in the world, and to stop that rising India,"" he claimed. BJP leaders have been urging people to vote for the party in Delhi assembly polls on February eight to show their disapproval for the ongoing anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh. Reacting to the incident, AAP leader Sanjay Singh said they had already warned the Election Commission that a conspiracy is being hatched by the BJP to postpone the polls. ""There is no law and order in the country. The gun-toting men are not making Delhi their bastion (adda).We have been seeking time from the Election Commission since yesterday so that we can make them aware of these developments but they have not given us any time,"" he said. However, senior BJP leader B L Santhosh insinuated involvement of party's rivals in the recent shooting incidents, saying the ""great drama party of Delhi is becoming too costly for the country"". ""One more drama today. This time the gun shot is near Shaheen Bagh. The acts are looking too dramatic to be real. Person brandishes gun...shoots couple of bullets...shouts some words against a community .The great drama party of Delhi is becoming too costly for the country,"" he tweeted. In a veiled attack on the BJP over the incident, the Congress said the shooter has changed but the ideology pulling the trigger in 1948 or 2020 has remained the same. A man fired two rounds in air in the Shaheen Bagh area in Jamia Nagar, where an anti-CAA protest is on, following which he was taken into custody by police, eyewitnesses said. Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill tweeted,""Shooter changes but ideology pulling the trigger either in 1948 (Nathuram Godse) or 2020 remains the same 'Goli Maro' -- Hands which should be pulling India's growth are now firing guns."" ""Instead of 'Make in India' focus is on 'spreading hate in India',"" he alleged. On Monday, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur while addressing a election rally, had raised the slogan of ‘desh ke gaddaron ko' (traitors in the country) as the crowd responded with ‘goli maaron sa***n ko'. The next day, BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma said protesters at Shaheen Bagh could ""enter homes and rape our sisters and daughters”. The Election commission asked the BJP to remove both Thakur and Verma from the list of star campaigners. It also barred Thakur from campaigning for three days and Verma for four days for their controversial remarks.

 CAA in 'clear violation' of Indian Constitution and international human rights law: Amnesty | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: Amnesty International has told the US lawmakers that the recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) stands in ""clear violation"" of the Constitution of India and international human rights law and ""legitimises discrimination"" on the basis of religion. The new citizenship law passed by Parliament in December 2019 offers citizenship to non-Muslim persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The Indian government has been emphasising that the new law will not deny any citizenship rights, but has been brought to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and give them citizenship. Amnesty International Asia Pacific Advocacy Manager Francisco Bencosme made the remarks during a testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations and House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee. The Indian Parliament “passed the Citizenship Amendment Act, which legitimises discrimination on the basis of religion and stands in clear violation of the constitution of India and international human rights law,” Bencosme said. India has asserted that the legislation on CAA was enacted following the due process. ""The CAA is an internal matter of India. It has been adopted through due process and democratic means,"" Spokesperson of the Ministry of external affairs Raveesh Kumar has said, fending off criticism against the CAA. Defending the CAA, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month said that the law is not about taking away citizenship, it is about giving citizenship. ""We must all know that any person of any religion from any country of the world who believes in India and its Constitution can apply for Indian citizenship through due process. There's no problem in that,"" he said. The two subcommittees jointly organised a hearing on Ending Global Religious Persecution. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
West Bengal: Raising ‘One Billion’ voices against citizenship law | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: It’s not enough to talk about violence against women only. Voices have to be raised against atrocities on minorities and the marginalized as well, and anyone who is feeling insecure in the current circumstances, when even something as basic as citizenship is coming up for questioning. This was the rhetoric at the three-hour One Billion Rising programme organised by the Loreto nuns at Allen Park on Friday. Hundreds of students at Loreto schools in the city gathered to sing, dance and add voice to the “Rising”, the sixth celebration in the city of the global movement started in the US by writer-women’s rights activist Eve Ensler in 2012. The concept is based on the fact that one out of every three women worldwide is subjected to violence at least once in lifetime. The OBR organiser in the city, Kolkata Mary Ward Social Centre, is a unit of the Loreto order and this year, it collaborated with Loreto Elliot Road to bring the Rising to life. Every year, one Loreto school, along with the Mary Ward, carries the baton. The slogan, ‘Rise, Resist, Unite,’ also included voices against CAA and NRC, following a resolution to this effect taken at the OBR Delhi headquarters. “At OBR, people are taught to respect women, but as things stand now, there is an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in the entire civil society. OBR is a natural platform of protest and hence, we are using it as an umbrella to include minorities and their fears. Let OBR be the platform, where we can preach respect for the Constitution,” said Nandini Bhattacharjee, a teacher at Loreto Elliot Road who coordinated the programme. The chief of the city’s OBR, Monica Suchiang, a Loreto nun, also the director of Mary Ward, felt women worldwide have been rising, pledging to stand by one another. “The conviction is uncanny… you have finally met your tormentor eye-to-eye and that is the magic moment when you know you have conquered him,” Sister Suchiang said. The Superior of Loreto order, Sister Sabrina, was also present at the event. The high point of the programme was the discussion, Addressing Inequality Challenges, where ‘inequality’ transcended ‘gender issues’ and encompassed discrimination meted out to religious minorities and communities. The speakers included Nandita Pal Choudhury, Anchita Ghatak, Deep Purakayastha, Saira Halim, Madiha Ahmed and Nick Rampal. The talk was moderated by Anglo Indian MLA Shane Calvert. The speakers likened the current political situation to fascism. “Even a few years ago, the challenges of being a woman was there but I was not made to feel like a minority,” said Halim, a social activist and writer. Calvert pointed out that mankind progressed only when there was tolerance and congratulated the organizers for extending the scope of OBR this time.

Mazumdar (30) was picked up from outside the Rajiv Bhawan, the state Congress headquarters here, soon after he came out of the building after addressing a press meet. He was taken to Dispur police station where he produced his bail papers. Hours later, the CID stepped in and booked him under a different case that was shown to have been registered last year. Assistant commissioner of police Himanshu Das said, ""He was evading interrogation after two cases were registered against him. Today, we met him in the ABC area and took him to the police station.

Speaking to TOI, Jyoti Bikash Changmai, president of NSUI, said, ""If Zubair Anam Mazumdar is guilty of the charges against him, then law must punish him. But he should not be harassed if he is innocent. The investigation should be fair.""

Book Mumbai school management for sedition for pro-CAA drama: Congress | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Nearly a week after the Karnataka police registered a case of sedition against a school management in Bidar after its students performed a drama which was against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens, Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Friday asked the Maharashtra home department to register a similar case against a school management in Matunga for organizing a pro-CAA drama on January 10. In Bidar, Sawant said the drama was staged by class IV, V and VI students on January 21, while a case of sedition was registered on January 26 and the headmistress and mother of a student arrested. “It was a politically motivated decision... the drama was critical of CAA and Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he told TOI. From media reports, it appears that a pro-CAA event was organized in a Matunga school on January 10. “It’s an identical case. In our view, if a case can be registered in Bidar, a similar offence should be registered against the Matunga school for holding students to ransom to support the controversial law,” Sawant added. Launching a frontal attack against BJP, Sawant said it was unfortunate that offences are being registered against activists in BJP-ruled states if they speak against the party. “Heads of BJPruled states must adhere to Raj dharma, act impartially,” he said. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik concurred that it was wrong on the part of the Bidar police to book the school management for staging the anti-CAA drama. “I feel that it is one’s fundamental right to express his or her opinion. Under such circumstances, it is wrong to book students for sedition,” Malik added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Chennai: Paucity of metro cabs makes last mile connectivity a dream | Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Commuters alighting at metro stations and hoping to book metro cabs on their smartphones may have to wait for hours as there are not enough cabs available at metro stations to ferry them to their destination. CMRL launched its app-based service in August 2019 at 13 stations, in addition to share autos and share taxis, to provide last mile connectivity to commuters. While the service has now been extended to 17 stations with a fleet of 32 cabs, a lot of stations have only one or two feeder cabs. The Airport metro is an exception, where nine cabs are operated to Pammal and MPEZ. The paucity of feeder cabs is making commute an arduous task for metro rail passengers ""During morning peak hours when we have to get to our workplace on time, no cabs are available. I have waited for at least 20 minutes to catch a cab. If CMRL can make more cabs available during peak hours, it would be easy for regular commuters like me to get to our destination faster,"" said K Srinivasan, a commuter at Government Estate metro, where CMRL operates three cabs including two to Government Estate and Secretariat. Stations like Central Metro and Alandur, which are important stations attracting more footfalls than others, are yet to get this app-based service. The cab service developed by Ford Mobility is operated by Mega Cab and is linked to a smartphone app, which works similar to other app-based cab services in the citys. Users can book a cab by choosing one of the five pick-up points for every station. The app assists commuters with the distance and the arrival time of the nearest vehicle. By booking a cab, commuters can also reserve a seat of their choice and either pay before taking the trip or swipe the metro smartcard after the trip ends. The service operates on a set route of six to eight kilometres from every station with a flat rate of 10. A CMRL official said they will be expanding the cab fleet to 256 and operate service across all the 32 stations of Phase-1. ""By March, we will extend the service to all the stations, each having a minimum eight cabs. Depending on the demand we will increase the number of cabs in certain stations,"" he said.

"Muslims protest against CAA, NRC outside Jama Masjid | Ludhiana News - Times of India","Ludhiana: Members of the Muslim community protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and National Register for Citizens (NRC) outside the Jamia Masjid here on Friday. The protestors who participated in the protest under the banner of Majlis-e-Ahrar Islam also burnt the effigy of the Union government and raised slogans against it. Speaking on the occasion, Shahi Imam (Punjab) Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi alleged that Union minister Anurag Thakur was trying to incite riots by threatening to fire bullets, and he was trying to paint Delhi politics with a communal and caste colour, stooping to low levels of inciting hatred instead of talking about development issues. “Anurag Thakur is a part of the Modi government, so he can threaten to murder democracy, but if peaceful protestors at Shaheen Bagh utter such words, they are booked by the police. The BJP government should not forget that the country belongs to all, and there is a rule of the constitution. Democracy doesn’t allow those ruling the country to take the law in their hands,” said the head priest. He added: “It is unfortunate that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who talks of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’, is silent on the threats of Anurag Thakur. Wouldn’t it have been better if he had acted against his minister, but here those indulging in communalism get the top posts.” He alleged that the firing by a person at Jamia indicated that the government was promoting all those who were trying to disturb the atmosphere of the country by indulging in such acts. The Shahi Imam said this would not be tolerated at any cost. Meanwhile, protestors were carrying placards with messages like ‘We want equality, No CAA, Stop two-nation theory’, ‘We don’t want, we don’t want CAA and NRC’, and ‘Stop dividing Indians on religious lines’. A protestor said they were for communal harmony, and would not tolerate anyone trying to create problems between various communities.

All-women anti-CAA/NRC protests rock Ballarpur | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Chandrapur: Terming the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) as a black law, thousands of women staged daylong sit-in near Ballarpur Municipal Council office on Friday. The protesters also condemned the Centre’s proposed move to go for National Register of Citizens (NRC) despite strong opposition to it throughout the country. The sit-in was staged under the banner of Women Against NRC, Muslim Ekta Manch and other organizations. Addressing the all-women protest, Aam Aadmi Party leader Paromita Goswami said the CAA and NRC are not just about Muslims, but also against the OBCs and Scheduled Tribes. “Women will be worst sufferers of this black law as they will have to face Herculean task of proving their citizenship based on their name, which changes after marriage. Many people don’t have any proof of their birth date or birth place etc. Such people will face the daunting task of proving their citizenship,” said Goswami. Lamenting that so far only Muslim women have stepped out against the government’s move in large numbers, Goswami warned that the anti-CAA/NRC protests would not gain momentum unless women from other communities too join it. Other leaders highlighted the deceptive nature of the CAA. They claimed that the CAA in its present form poses threat to the Constitution of India and sows seeds of discord between communities living harmoniously since ages.

"Give states power to decide on CAA, TRS MPs tell PM | Hyderabad News - Times of India","Hyderabad: States should be given the power to decide whether to implement legislation like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). This was stated by TRS MPs K Keshava Rao and Nama Nagehswara Rao during an all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Lok Sabha speaker Om Prakash Birla in Delhi on Thursday. The meeting was held ahead of the budget session in Parliament. “Many state assemblies have passed resolutions against CAA. We said during the meeting that a detailed discussion should be held if the Centre legislates an Act and states pass resolutions against it,” Keshava Rao, who is a Rajya Sabha MP, told TOI. “Now a peculiar situation has arisen as thousands of people are out on the streets protesting against CAA, NPR and NRC. Federalism lies in states getting more powers.” Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has said his government will move a resolution against CAA in the upcoming assembly session. If the Centre has the power to bring a bill, states have the right to express their opinion in the form of a resolution, he added. “We asked the Centre to think over the situation in the country. Apart from this, we asked for removing doubts on NPR and NRC as some Union ministers had made contradictory statements on NRC,” the TRS MP, who is also secretary general of the party, added. Referring to GST and IGST dues, he said the present trend of increased centralisation of powers by the Union government was forcing the states to knock the doors of the Centre with a begging bowl for their legitimate funds. “Telangana was entitled for over Rs 50,000 crore dues which were not cleared,” Keshava Rao said. TRS Lok Sabha floor leader Nama Nagehswara Rao said, “We also raised issues related to the economic slowdown and unemployment and their impact on the state. Besides, we want a discussion on issues pending over the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014.

Parties concerned over Kerala cops’ partisan approach | Kochi News - Times of India,"Kozhikode: Concerns have been raised from various corners over the perceived pro-Sangh Parivar attitude of the Kerala police in dealing with the developments after the introduction of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The allegation is that police are taking a partisan approach while dealing with a section of the community. The latest example cited is the case registered against SDPI workers who protested when Sangh Parivar activists took out a march in Vadakara on Thursday. The Sangh Parivar staged a protest alleging that there was local support for the accused in the Kaliyikkavila case. Vadakara police registered cases against both the groups but Section of IPC 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) was charged against SDPI workers. Similarly, Mannuthy police registered a case against Welfare Party of India state secretary K Sajeed under Section 153 of IPC for a Facebook post against police. “My post was on the incident of a person named Babu attacking a middle-aged woman Jameela at Mullakkara in Thrissur, asking her to leave the country. In the post, I said police are trying to make the accused a mentally unstable person. Now, police have registered a case against me too,” Sajeed told TOI. Thrissur police, however, said Babu has been charged with Sections 323, 341 and 354 of the IPC. A case was registered against Sajeed for posting a baseless comment that the accused had shouted at the woman to go to Pakistan. The accused was violent when he was brought to the police station and he was sent to mental health centre, police said. “The government says one thing and police are moving in another direction. Pinarayi Vijayan and the CPM said they are against the UAPA, but police slapped the law on Allan Shuhaib and Twaha Fasal. There is something mysterious about the pro-Sangh Parivar attitude of the Kerala police,” said Musthafa Kommeri, secretary of the SDPI. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" BJP-RSS need no suggestion from CM on CAA, says MP BJP chief | India News - Times of India","BHOPAL: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat reached the state capital on Friday in view of his week-long visit to Guna and Bhopal for organisational affairs. Bhagwat's visit has sparked a political debate between the BJP and the ruling Congress with the latter alleging that RSS was provoking youths in the name of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The BJP has also hit out at Congress for misguiding public on CAA. ""RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat will be in the state. I welcome him. I also expect that during his visit he will deliver the message of peace, unity and brotherhood,"" said state higher education minister Jitu Patwari, apparently targeting saffron groups for instigating youths in the name of CAA. State public relations minister PC Sharma also took a dig, ""Bhagwat ji will be in MP. I request him not to provoke youths during his stay in the state."" A day before, chief minister Kamal Nath had also welcomed RSS chief to MP. ""Bhagwat ji is free to visit Bhopal anytime. We expect that he would give right direction to the state and the country,"" said Nath, on Thursday. He also raised questions over the need of bringing CAA instead of focusing on economy and unemployment. ""What is the need for bringing CAA at this hour when the country is grappling with severe problems. Now they are roaming around to garner public support and misguiding the people away from crucial issues,"" Nath had said. RSS sources said that Bhagawat reached Sangh Parivar’s regional headquarters `Samidha' in Bhopal on Friday afternoon and left for Guna after meeting some party cadres. On Saturday, he will inaugurate a three-day convention of college-going youths in Guna, which is being organised by the Sangh Parivar and address 2,000 student volunteers on organisational activities. Senior RSS cadre including Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh, Arun Kumar will also participate in the camp. Bhagwat's three-day visit to Bhopal from February 4 assumes more significance in the political circles as it is believed that he would discuss with the BJP leaders about party's public awareness campaign on CAA and the future plans to gain public support on ideological issues. The BJP has retaliated on Congress' remarks on Bhagwat's visit. ""It was the Congress who is spreading confusion and provoking people on CAA. MP chief minister will not decide what would be the next step of BJP and RSS on the CAA. The BJP and RSS do not require Kamal Nath's certificate on any issue,"" reacted BJP state president Rakesh Singh on Congress’ remarks. The BJP has also involved intellectuals and selected social activists to hold discussions with RSS chief during his stay. The party leaders are also preparing for a detailed discussion over ideological issues during Bhagwat's visit, said sources. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Anti-CAA protests: SC notice to UP govt on plea for quashing notices for recovering damages | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court agreed to hear a plea seeking quashing of notices sent to alleged protestors by district administration for recovering losses caused by damage to public properties during the anti-CAA agitations in Uttar Pradesh and asked the state to respond to it. A bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and K M Joseph issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on the plea and directed it to file its reply within four weeks. The apex court was hearing a plea which has alleged that such notices have been sent in Uttar Pradesh in an ""arbitrary manner"" against a person, who had died six years ago at the age of 94, and also to several others including two who are aged above 90. The counsel appearing for petitioner Parwaiz Arif Titu said these notices were based on an Allahabad High Court judgement delivered in 2010 which ""is in violation of the guidelines"" laid down by the top court in a 2009 verdict which was later re-affirmed in a 2018 order. The lawyer said the state government has appointed additional district magistrate to deal with the process of notices for recovering damages for loss of public property during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act whereas the guidelines laid down by the apex court stipulated that retired judges should deal with it. ""The Supreme Court's judgement is not being followed,"" the petitioner's counsel said. At the fag end of hearing, the counsel urged the court to give him liberty to make the Centre as a party in the case. The bench asked him to file application in this regard. The plea has sought stay on these notices claiming they have been sent to persons who have not been booked under any penal provisions and no details of FIR or any criminal offences have been made out against them. ""The contradiction is that while the Supreme Court in 2009 put the onus of assessment of damages and recovery from the accused on high courts of every state, whereas the Allahabad High Court had issued guidelines in 2010 judgement that let the state government undertake these processes to recover damages, which has serious implications,"" said the plea, filed through advocate Nilofar Khan. ""The judicial oversight/judicial security is a sort of safety mechanism against arbitrary action. This means that there is every chance that the ruling party in the state could go after its political opponents or others oppose to it to settle scores,"" it said. It also sought a direction to the Uttar Pradesh government to follow the procedure as per the 2009 and 2018 guidelines of the apex court while claiming damages to recover the losses caused to public property during such protests. The plea sought setting up of an independent judicial inquiry to probe into the incidents which happened during the protests against the amended citizenship act and the National Register of Citizens in Uttar Pradesh, as has been done by the Karnataka High Court. It claimed that the BJP-led Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh is ""moving ahead on the chief minister's promise of avenging loss to public property"" by seizing assets of protestors in order to ""take revenge for political reasons from one community who is in minority"". The plea further alleged that around 925 persons, who have been arrested so far in connection with the violent protests, may not get bail easily in Uttar Pradesh till they pay up for the losses as they have to be given ""conditional bail"" only after they deposit the amount. ""The government of Uttar Pradesh and its administration and police are no longer behaving like the arm of a democratic government as it cracked down on protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019/NRC. The police on the instructions of the Uttar Pradesh administration used disproportionate force and denied public accountability,"" it alleged.

 President misquoted Mahatma Gandhi to justify CAA: Left parties | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Left parties on Friday slammed President Ram Nath Kovind for misquoting Mahatma Gandhi to ""justify"" the amended Citizenship Act. CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the Narendra Modi government has been invoking Mahatma Gandhi to propagate their lies. ""Modi government continues to lie by invoking Gandhi's ideas, now in the President's address, on the divisive CAA. Their lies stand exposed. Gandhi spoke the exact opposite in the cited statement. Gandhiji was killed because he stood for a secular and inclusive India,"" Yechury said in a tweet. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Kovind during his address to a joint sitting of Parliament said, ""The Muslims have said they would be loyal to India. Let us trust them with all our heart. Let us remember that truth alone triumphs never untruth."" Yechury said that Gandhi had in fact said, ""Muslims, who have chosen to remain in India are loyal to India and we should give them our complete trust. In all his writings he has always spoken about all the religions together. He has even said that those Hindus and Sikhs who choose to go to Pakistan should be loyal to Pakistan."" He slammed the President for being silent on the real problems of the people. CPI General Secretary D Raja also said that Gandhi's name is being taken in vain. ""It's very inappropriate to take name of Gandhi to justify the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the communal policy of this government.

Anti-CAA and NRC protesters burn effigy of Union government in Ludhiana | Ludhiana News - Times of India,"LUDHIANA: Members of Muslim community protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC outside Jamia Masjid here on Friday. The protesters who participated in the protest under the banner of Majlis-e-Ahrar Islam also burnt the effigy of Union government and raised slogans against it. Speaking on the occasion, Shahi Imam Punjab Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi questioned that whether the Union Minister Anurag Thakur is trying to incite riots by threatening of firing bullets. He alleged that the Minister is trying to paint the Delhi politics with communal and caste colour and has stooped to such level that instead of talking about development issues is spreading hatred. “Anurag Thakur is part of Modi government so he can threaten to murder democracy and if peaceful protesters at Shaheen Bagh utter such words they are booked by police. The BJP government should not forget that the country belongs to all and there is rule of constitution. The democracy doesn’t allow those ruling the country to take law in their hands and indulge in Goondaism,” Head Priest said. “It is unfortunate that Prime Minister Narindra Bhai Modi, who talks of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, is silent on the threats of Anurag Thakur. Wouldn’t it have been better if he would have acted against his minister but here those indulging in communalism get top post”. He alleged that the firing by a person at Jamia is indicates that government is promoting all those who are trying to disturb the atmosphere of the country by indulging in such acts. Shahi Imam said that this will not be tolerated at any cost.

 Congress prepares to target Modi govt over CAA-NRC and economy in Parliament | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: With the Budget session of Parliament due to begin later this week, Congress is readying a “vigorous” two-pronged attack on the Modi government over the controversial CAA-NRC-NPR as well as on the downward spiral of the economy. Party sources said the session will see Congress corner the government over economic stress, increasing joblessness, plunging GDP and rising inflation on the one hand, while on the other, it will also continue its attack on the government over its “communal and divisive” agenda — displayed though the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR). Congress will also hold a training session for its MPs, general secretaries and senior party functionaries on February 4, to explain to them the differences between the NPR proposed by BJP — with the additional questions — and the one that was mooted by the UPA government in its first term. Party sources said the leadership feels there is a need to have complete clarity among its members on what Congress is opposing in the new NPR and why it believes that the additional data is, in fact, being collected as a pre-cursor to NRC. “After coming under attack over NRC, the government has now mooted NPR which is nothing but the first step to NRC. While the government is now trying to confuse people by claiming that the information sought under NPR is optional, we want to expose the government’s real segregationist agenda behind the exercise,” a Congress functionary said. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram who was Union home minister when the idea of NPR was first mooted, will lead the training session to explain the differences between the old and new NPR to Congress functionaries.

" Leaders of 14 opposition parties wear black arm bands during President's address to protest against CAA, NRC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Registering strong protest against the NPR, NRC and the amended Citizenship Act, leaders of 14 opposition parties, including the Congress, on Friday wore black arm bands during the President's address to both the Houses of Parliament, saying it was ""shameful"" on the part of the government to claim the CAA as an achievement. The opposition leaders earlier also staged a protest outside Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Parliament complex and raised slogans against the government while standing in solidarity with those protesting against the National Population Register (NPR), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Sources said various opposition parties would move amendments on President Ram Nath Kovind's address seeking the removal of reference made to the passage of the CAA from it. Leaders of these parties, including Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and Congress president Sonia Gandhi did not sit on their designated seats in the front and second rows and sat together in one block in the Central hall of Parliament during the President's address as a mark of their protest. The black bands were worn as a mark of protest against the alleged attack on the Constitution of India with the passage of the amended Citizenship Act by the government, the leaders said. Opposition members also protested after President Kovind hailed the CAA in his address. As soon as the President made these remarks, some opposition members shouted ""shame, shame"" and displayed banners in the Central Hall. Among the leaders of the opposition parties who wore black bands were Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Shiv Sena, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha Janata Dal (Secular), Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), Kerala Congress (M), Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and the National Conference (NC), besides the Congress, the sources said. ""Fourteen political parties protested outside Mahatma Gandhi's statue and sat on a dharna there since morning and wore black bands on their arms as a mark of protest against the NPR, NRC and CAA,"" Azad told reporters, adding that the opposition leaders also left their designated seats in the front row and sat at the back. ""It is unfortunate that the government has included the passage of the CAA in the president's address and termed it as an achievement. There cannot be a bigger shame than the government claiming the CAA as their achievement. The president only reads the address prepared by the Union Cabinet,"" he said. ""It is a state-sponsored violence as government has done nothing to prevent it,"" CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said while referring to the shooting incident at Jamia on Thursday. ""The society is dangerously inching towards a civil war-like situation and the government is solely responsible for it. The government's agenda is to divide the people to consolidate its own Hindutva motive,"" Yechury said. Azad said there is no mention of unemployment, falling GDP, price rise in the president's address. ""The government's claim that a lot of development has taken place in Jammu and Kashmir after it was turned into a union territory is a lie and a cruel joke on the people of the state and the government should apologise to them as well as the country,"" he said. Yechury said all the parties are concerned about the development situation in the country, alleging that strife is rising. The government has not given any signal of resolving the protests and are instead resorting to violence on protesters, he said. Congress leader Anand Sharma said what has happened is an assault on the Constitution as many of the legislations, which have been claimed as achievements of the government, are ""divisive"" and have created deep fault lines in the country and there is tension. ""The government is arrogant and it is also lacking in compassion, the kind of violence that has been engineered, triggered and the kind of language that the ministers and the senior leaders of the BJP are using. Therefore, when we have questioned the constitutional morality of some of the steps taken by the government which we have said are discriminatory and divisive. These should not have found any reference in the president's address. Tomorrow, yes the Budget will come but we know that India is staring at a deepening economic recession,"" he alleged. ""It is unfortunate that when the country is commemorating 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi and 500 years of Guru Nanak, what is happening in India militates against what they stood for and their teachings. This is what the government is expected to address, not to become an active agent in polarising and dividing for short-term political gains,"" Sharma said. ""So, we have said Rashtrapati Ji's 'abhibhashan' (address) did not even have platitudes. This was a laundry list of wrong laws,"" he said. Earlier in the day, top Congress leaders led by the Congress president staged a protest near Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Parliament complex to save the Constitution and express solidarity with those protesting against the Citizenship Act, NRC and the NPR. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi was accompanied by party leader Rahul Gandhi, Azad, senior party leaders Motilal Vohra, Ahmed Patel, Adhir Ranjan Choudhury, A K Antony and all party MPs from Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha.

Leaders, including former legislator Trilok Purbia, chairperson of the congress committee, Udaipur city Gopal Krishna Sharma, general secretary Pankaj Sharma claimed the anti-social elements and communal forces had pressurized the police to take such an action and lathicharged innocent public. “The lathicharge was done at two places.

BJP government has plunged nation into disharmony: A K Antony | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The BJP-led government, through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), has plunged the nation into an atmosphere of hatred and disharmony, said Congress working committee member and former defence minister A K Antony. “The Indian citizenship was never based on any religion, but it has become so now. We demand a repeal of the act which is aimed to destroy the country’s secularism and communal harmony,” he said, while inaugurating the UDF’s ‘human map’ protest against the CAA in the state capital on Thursday. The event, projected by the UDF as an alternative to the LDF’s human chain organized on Republic Day, was held in 12 districts. Intended as a protest against ‘the BJP’s attempt to communally divide the country in the name of CAA’, it was not conducted in Wayanad district owing to the long march led by MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday. In Kozhikode, the programme was cancelled due to the death of former minister and Congress leader M Kamalam on Thursday morning. Addressing the gathering at Putharikandam Maidan in the capital, Antony said not all in the state were joining the protest, ‘as a section of people were being misled or influenced by the BJP workers’. “They are being told that CAA will not affect them. But this not the India which Mahatma Gandhi envisaged, a secular nation where Hindus and Muslims could live together in unity,” he said. The senior Congress leader also came down heavily on the Modi-government for not taking any action against moves to build temples in north India for Gandhi’s killer Naturam Godse. “It’s really painful to have a ruling member in our Parliament who projects Godse as a brave soldier and a patriot,” he said. The Congress move comes in the wake of a 700-km-long human chain formed by LDF supporters across the state last Sunday.

The President said India has always believed in the principle of equal respect for all faiths but at the time of partition in 1947, ""this very belief of India and of its people came under the most severe attack"".  Kovind said in the environment prevailing in the aftermath of partition, the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi had said: ""Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan, who do not wish to live there, can come to India. It is the duty of the government of India to ensure a normal life for them"".  The President said many national leaders and political parties have from time to time supported the idea of 'Pujya Bapu' and further propagated it.  ""It is our responsibility to honour this wish of the founding fathers of our nation. I am happy that both the Houses of Parliament have fulfilled this wish, by enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act.

A person of any faith can follow these processes and become a citizen of India.

""At the same time, any kind of violence in the name of protests weakens the society and the nation,"" he said, without referring to the CAA.

"Now, caste certificate on basis of mother's caste | Ahmedabad News - Times of India","AHMEDABAD: In May last year, the MLA of Morva Hadaf assembly constituency Bhupendra Khant, was disqualified by the speaker for submitting an invalid caste certificate after his opponents challenged his election win. The tribal development commissioner held that his ST certificate was not valid even as Khant pleaded that he was brought up in Bhil community by his ST mother after she was deserted by his father who belonged to OBC community. Ironically, if the new circular issued by the state government was in place, Khant's caste certificate on basis of his mother's ST status would have withstood the legal scrutiny. The fresh circular, adopted on guidelines of the Union government, directs collectors and directors of social justice department to issue SC and ST certificates to children of women from these communities, who are separated, divorced or single mothers. This is a marked deviation from the practice of granting caste certificates on the basis of the father's caste. The circular, however, adds that each individual case will have to be examined in light of existing facts and circumstances in such cases. The state government circular is in furtherance of a letter written by the Union social justice and empowerment ministry to chief secretaries of all state governments and Union territories. The circular states that ""In cases where a child has been brought up in surroundings of a notified community to which the mother belongs to, and has suffered the deprivations, indignities, humilities and handicaps like any other member of that community, then such a child of separated/divorced/single women has to be treated as a member of the scheduled caste community and would be entitled to receive benefits as such."" The government has relied on two court orders - one by the Supreme Court in Rameshbhai Naika Vs State of Gujarat and Others and the other a Delhi High Court order in Rumy Chowdhury Vs Department of Revenue, Government of NCT of Delhi. Courts have, in both these orders, ruled that the practice of issuance of caste certificate based on the caste of the father is not without exceptions.

"Couple designs wedding card with anti-NRC, CAA message | Kolkata News - Times of India","Midnapore: A couple from Keshpur in West Midnapore have voiced their protest against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on their wedding card. They plan to theme their wedding around the anti-NRC/CAA movement and spread a message of peace and harmony. The groom — Md Alif, a graduate in English and a resident of Mugbasan in Keshpur — runs a dealership of kerosene. He will get married to Hasina Mumtaz who is from a neighbouring village on February 27.

I believe that as an Indian, I should also protest against the same. Hence, I designed the wedding card, voicing my protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

No-violence plea from demonstration platforms | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: CAA protesters in Kolkata condemned Wednesday’s violence in Murshidabad where two people died in a clash and appealed not to identify the widespread protests against the citizenship law with any community or political outfit. There have been attempts from both sides of the political spectrum to either discredit the protests. On Wednesday, two groups both of whom oppose CAA but differed on forcing a bandh clashed, killing two persons. “We condemn use of violence in any form. The protests and the movement is not Islamic in nature. Let us unite and rise above communal divide,” said Arshad Parvez Khan, an organizer of a demonstration at Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore. Nousheen Baba Khan, a PhD scholar who is a familiar face at anti CAA protests in the city, too, cautioned against people trying to brand the civil and secular movement as a Muslim one. “CAA and NRC are anti-poor. It cannot be associated with any one community. In Assam, more Hindus are suffering than Muslims,” Khan said. “I condemn those trying to spread Islamophobia under the garb of nationalism. I also want to caution some Muslims who are putting out statements that are making the community a target for bigots. Both are fringe groups and have no space in our secular movement,” he said. People from all communities, including Sikhs, Christians and Hindus, have also staged series of protests against CAA in the city. “The anti-CAA protests have brought together all the citizens who feel the secular fabric of the country is under threat and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution are being violated. It will be unfair to identify it with any particular community,” said Sneha Sarkar, a college student who is a regular at the demonstrations at Park Circus and Hogg Street. Religious figures have also urged people to protest peacefully and co-operate with law enforcing agencies. “The two deaths in Murshidabad is very sad. We are protesting against an authoritarian and barbaric regime.

Asked to list the major achievements of the Uttar Pradesh Police during his tenure as its chief, OP Singh listed the challenge of maintaining peace during the pronouncement of Ayodhya verdict and peaceful hosting of Kumbh by the state. Credited with initiating structural changes in the police department, Singh will be seen as the DGP who made police commissioner system possible in the state. The commissioner system was introduced in Lucknow and Gautambuddh Nagar earlier this month. “The entire police force wanted the commissioner system and the proposal for adopting it had been moved earlier, but I am glad that the system was introduced when I am leading the force,” the DGP said. About handling the protests against the new citizenship law, the 1983 batch IPS officer said the challenging part was handling the manner in which the agitation spread like wildfire across the state. “We tried to tactfully handle the protests and ensure minimum damage to public property, which usually bears the brunt of such agitations. That some lives were lost during these protests was unfortunate,” he said, referring to the deaths of protesters during the December 2019 protests.

Goa: Anti-CAA protesters vow to march to Assembly on February 3 | Goa News - Times of India,"MARGAO: Noted environmental activists Claude Alvares and Ramesh Gawas on Thursday lent their voices to castigate the central government at an anti-CAA protest meeting held at Margao, even as the large number of people gathered were called on to join a protest march to the state legislative assembly on February 3, the first day of the Assembly session. “...And if needed we won’t allow the assembly sesison to be held,” said activist Rama Kankonkar . He urged the two MLAs present at the meeting – Churchill Alemao and Vijai Sardesai – not to attend the Assembly and to join the protesters instead. Another speaker, Iftikar Shaikh urged the MLAs to raise the issue in the Assembly. Chairperson of Margao Municipal Council Pooja Naik was also present at the meeting. While Gawas said that the CAA/NRC/NPR was part of the larger goal of “Hindu Rashtra” as propounded by RSS second sarsanghchalak M S Golwalkar, Alvares warned that deportation of Muslims on grounds of failure to produce citizenship documents would happen “only over our dead bodies.” “The concept of making Bharat a Hindu Rashtra has been an integral part of RSS ideology since 1925. As regards Muslims, Golwalkar wrote in his book ‘Vichar Dhan’ that if Muslims wished to stay in India, they should do so as secondary citizens. The government’s moves are in furtherance of the same ideology,” Gawas said. Alvares accused prime minister Narendra Modi of “assaulting” the Constitution of India by bringing in the CAA. “An amendment to the Citizenship Act has for the first time excluded Muslims from the Constitution. And therefore more than 150 writ petitions have been filed in the court on the grounds that it is violating the Constitution of India,” Alvares said, adding that the CAA was also against the secular credentials of the nation.

He said, “People will try to provoke you, insult you with statements. Don’t get provoked. Keep protests peaceful,” he said.

"Campaign ban on Union minister Anurag Thakur, BJP MP Parvesh Verma | Delhi Election 2020 Election News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: New Delhi: A day after it directed BJP to remove junior finance minister Anurag Thakur and West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma from its list of star campaigners for Delhi assembly polls, the Election Commission on Thursday barred the two functionaries from campaigning for 72 hours and 96 hours, respectively, over their “communal” remarks. While EC in its order said both Thakur and Verma had violated Section 123 (3A) and Section 125 of the Representation of the People Act, apart from model code of conduct, it refrained from issuing a direction to Delhi Police to file an FIR against them. However, a senior EC functionary told TOI that both the district magistrate concerned and the police were empowered by CrPC to directing filing of or file an FIR against the 2 BJP leader, on their own. As per Section 125 of R P Act, anybody who tries to promote feelings of hatred between communities on grounds of religion in connection with an election, may be punished with imprisonment up to three years or with fine. The EC on Thursday also issued a notice to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for promising mohalla clinics in courts if space was made available. The ban came into effect from 5 pm on Thursday. Singh was also issued a fresh notice on Thursday, the second in the past couple of days, for referring to Kejriwal as a “terrorist”. AAP had approached the Delhi chief electoral officer alleging that Singh had cast “vitriolic aspersions” on the CM during a TV interview. Stating that the “distorted statement” prima facie violated the model code, the EC asked the BJP MP to respond to the notice by 5 pm on Friday. The poll panel, in its order on Thakur and Singh, reiterated that its Tuesday decision to drop them from the BJP list of star campaigners would stay. It ordered that both be barred from public meetings, processions, rallies, road shows or giving media interviews in connection with the Delhi election till the time they are barred. Thakur, while addressing a public meeting in Rithala on January 27, had exhorted the crowd with “desh ke gaddaron ko”, to which the crowd replied, “goli maaron salon ko”. Singh, while campaigning in Vikaspuri the next day, said that what happened in Kashmir with the Pandits could happen in Delhi, and lakhs of anti-CAA protesters at Shaheen Bagh could “enter homes to kill and rape women”. He also said all mosques will be removed from government land in his constituency within a month of BJP assuming power in Delhi. Replying to the notice on Thursday, Thakur said he had only chanted “desh ke gaddaron ko” and that it was the crowd that responded with “goli maaron salon ko”. Rejecting his defence, the EC held the Union minister guilty of having violated the model code of conduct as well as Section 125 of the Representation of the People Act with his “undesirable and objectionable statements which have the tenor to aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred between difference religious communities”. A similar view was taken on Singh’s remarks. Both Thakur and Singh were denied personal hearings sought by them.

Police sources said an SRP sub-inspector was injured after violence erupted in Limbayat. The bandh remained peaceful in other parts of the state. While the bandh was nearly complete in Mahuva town of Bhavnagar district, and the coastal towns of Una and Mangrol, business establishments in minority-dominated areas of Amreli, Savarkundla and Junagadh also downed shutters.

" On Martyrs Day, 17-year-old fires at anti-CAA march in presence of cops | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: A peaceful protest by students of Jamia Millia University against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Thursday afternoon was disrupted by a shocking act of firing by a gunman in front of a police contingent and cameras telecasting the event live. As a student tried to reason with him, the gunman fired, injuring the student’s left hand, before he was taken into custody by the cops. The shooter, according to police, is a juvenile and his age is being verified. He was using a countrymade weapon which has a short range. Police have come under fire from many eyewitnesses and observers for not making any effort to rein in the youth when he was walking backwards towards them, waving the gun and shouting slogans. The cops were seen watching nonchalantly and one of them intervened quite late, after the man had fired. He handed over the gun to them and was taken away. A case of attempt to murder has been filed against him. The incident came after days of intense campaigning for the Delhi assembly elections when rhetoric on Shaheen Bagh has taken centrestage. It was around 1.40pm when the 17-year-old shooter, wearing white trousers and a black jacket, entered the protest site by climbing over the roadside grilles near Gate No. 4 of the university on Okhla Marg. The students — about 400 — were planning to march to Rajghat where they would have formed a human chain. ‘Come and take your freedom', screams shooter as cops watchInstead of joining the protesters, the youth started walking ahead of them, hurling abuses. One of the protesters, Shadab Farooq, along with some volunteers, approached the man and asked him to fall back in line so that they could begin the protest. However, the man hurled abuses at Farooq, whipped out a countrymade pistol and started threatening to shoot the protesters. In videos that went viral on social media, the youth is seen waving the pistol in the air and walking ahead of the protest while media persons and volunteers try to persuade him to drop the weapon. “He kept shouting at the protesters. ‘Aake le lo Azadi,’ he screamed. Before opening fire, he shouted, ‘Hindustan mein rehna hoga to Vande Mataram kehna hoga’,” said TOI photographer Tarun Rawat, who was at the scene when the incident unfolded. “We had thought he was among the protesters at first, but when he started waving the gun, we were taken aback and tried to convince him to drop the weapon. He walked with his back towards the police for a few metres and then suddenly opened fire at Farooq,” said one of Farooq’s batchmates. “The police were at a distance and had slowly started moving despite being alerted about the man carrying a gun,” she said. Witnesses say that after hearing the gunshot, they saw Farooq and his woman friend crouching on the road with blood oozing out of Farooq’s left hand. By this time, the policeman who had started walking towards the shooter took away the pistol and led him away. DCP (Southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said that since no permission was given to the protesters to hold a march, a barricade had been put up near Holy Family Hospital to stop them. The entire force was deployed behind the barricades, except for a few officers. “The incident happened within the few seconds during which the officers got alerted and the suspect opened fire. We immediately apprehended him,” he said. During the initial interrogation, the youth claimed that he had travelled to Delhi from a village near Jewar in UP with the intent of teaching the protesters a lesson. He claimed he was not affiliated with any organisation. Meanwhile, Farooq’s classmates rushed him to the barricades, asking the cops to remove them. “We requested the police to allow us to go through since Farooq was shot but they asked him to climb over the barricade. We had to haul him up over the barricade and go to the other side before walking to the hospital,” said one of his classmates. Farooq was then referred to AIIMS trauma centre. The police have registered a case of attempt to murder under Section 307 IPC and under Arms Act. They are in the process of verifying the age of the accused since he has produced his Aadhaar card and certificates that mention his age to be 17 years and nine months. However, the date of birth mentioned in his Class X CBSE marksheet, which TOI has accessed, is April 8, 2002, which makes him older. It was found that he had procured the weapon from an arms dealer in UP. Police have informed his family and will produce him before the juvenile justice board. Meanwhile, Election Commission has sought a report regarding the law and order situation from the police commissioner after the incident. Two senior police officers met the injured student at the trauma centre on Thursday evening.

Punjab BJP chief pulls up workers over few missed calls supporting CAA | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"Jalandhar: While Punjab BJP cadre appear enthusiastic after their party managed to make the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) do an about-face in Delhi, a figure cited by party’s state unit president Ashwani Sharma, in two meetings of with workers about missed calls from Punjab in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), tells a different story. Sources said during a meeting of BJP members in Chandigarh on Monday, Sharma had said there were just over 1 lakh missed calls on the mobile number given by the party to register support for the CAA. On Wednesday, he is said to have reiterated the figure in a meeting in Amritsar as he asked party workers to pull up socks, saying that the number was too low as there were 30 lakh members of the party in Punjab. When asked on Thursday about BJP’s claims of huge growth in its membership in Punjab in light of such a low number of calls in support of CAA, Sharma claimed that he “deliberately cited a low figure before the party workers” to push them for working more aggressively on the issue. “These are internal things of the party. I shall give the final number after this campaign will end. We never give exact figures when a campaign is on so that workers don’t get complacent,” he added. Asked what is the actual number, he said, “Real number is several time higher than what I said and we shall disclose it once the campaign is over.” About the party’s membership in Punjab, he insisted that there were total 30 lakh members of BJP in the state. When BJP launched its membership drive through missed calls, the party leaders claimed that over 23 lakh members were registered. Asked how many of the 23 lakh members registered through missed calls could finally be verified, he said that the number was 18 lakh and the party even had their addresses. “There were only 5-7 % who could not be verified. Now, our total membership the membership is touching 30 lakh,” Sharma said. Punjab BJP membership in charge Dyal Singh Sodhi claimed that in the membership drive last year, 10 lakh new members were enrolled. “Now total membership is above 30 lakh,” he too insisted.

"I’m going to school, Jamia shooter said at home | Noida News - Times of India","JEWAR: A little before Thursday noon, he picked up his bag and told his grandfather he was going to school. A bit late for school, but then his family was away for a wedding in Jhajjar and no one really was asking questions. He said he would head to the wedding after classes. The wedding, in reality, was far from his mind: the boy, a Class XII commerce student at a private school, had packed a gun in his bag and headed straight for Delhi (Shaheen Bagh was the subject of all the recent hatred he had been spewing on Facebook). A couple of hours later, his relatives and friends saw him on national TV — some on the Facebook Live he webcast before that — wildly brandishing a gun at Citizenship Amendment Act protesters near Jamia Millia Islamia and shooting at a student who tried to stop him. His 80-year-old grandfather, the only one home when the news broke, was in a state of disbelief. “I have no idea how he got a gun or who asked him to do this,” he said. The shooter’s mother teaches at a primary school. His father runs a store that is at the front of the house in a narrow Jewar village road that threads through a warren of single and double-storey homes stacked against each other. The boy’s brother is 13 years old. His family shares the two-storey ancestral home with the family of his deceased uncle — an aunt and a cousin who is about as old as he is. Within minutes of the news of his arrest, the lane was bustling with people, curious and confused in equal measure. Relatives and friends who had gathered said they had never seen a violent streak in him and insisted he was a well-behaved boy, drawing a personality sharply divergent from the one his Facebook friends saw: of undisguised hatred towards one community and his own violent intentions. “He’d stay home and not get too involved in things,” said Yogesh, a neighbour. But over the past few days, there had been a change in his behaviour when he was sullen and irritable. “He seemed unwell and disturbed about something. But we hadn’t expected things to take this turn,” he added. A friend who went to school with the shooter said he was shocked. “He was always quiet. We drifted apart a little after we chose different streams after Class X — I picked science and he studied commerce,” said the friend. “We would meet during recess and sometimes at the end of the school day. I don’t know how he got involved in all this. I am shocked.” What, then, was the trigger? Some speculated about community groups “brainwashing” him. Who he was at home and how he projected himself online were often at odds. “He held strongly nationalistic views. He would move around with certain groups, he would single out a community to abuse in his Facebook posts and would pick fights on social media,” said a neighbour. His posts were widely commented on and many of the reactions were congratulatory. But the consistent rants of hatred and threats of violence from a place barely 90km from the national capital did not, surprisingly, come to the notice of Noida Police, which has a digital volunteer force of citizens and former cops specifically for this purpose. Noida police have in the last three months registered eight FIRs against people for writing ‘objectionable’ social media posts and made six arrests. Additional CP Sriparna Ganguly, who is also the spokesperson for Noida police, admitted they were unaware about the boy. “Our digital volunteers didn’t share any information about the suspect in question but we’re surely going to take cognisance of it and rectify things in future,” she said.

" Scrap tweaked citizenship law, Chhattisgarh cabinet tells PM | India News - Times of India","RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh cabinet on Thursday urged PM Modi to scrap the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), saying that the law is discriminatory and against the spirit of the Constitution. “On the one hand, this Act appears to be discriminatory towards illegal immigrants based on their religious beliefs, contradictory to Article 14 of Indian Constitution, and on the other, the Act has no provision for people from neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan living in India,” reads CM Bhupesh Baghel’s letter to PM Modi. “Chhattisgarh is basically a state of people belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs, and most of these people are poor, illiterate and ill equipped, which will make it extremely difficult for them to complete the formalities under this Act,” Baghel said. “ CAA appears to be damaging the core spirit of the Constitution — secularism,” he said.

" Did not fund anti-CAA protests, PFI refutes charges | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Popular Front of India has issued a statement refuting allegations that it has financed the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The organisation has alleged that “groups with vested interests have always been trying to raise different types of allegations against the organisation, and it is not going to cease with this allegation. They will continue with new allegations as long as the organisation continues its fight for justice.” In a statement, M Mohamed Ali Jinnah, the general secretary of Popular Front of India, rejected allegations that the organisation is behind the violence and that investigations had revealed that about Rs 120 crore had been spent to carry out riots. “Popular Front is not behind, but is part of the protests against CAA wherever it has presence,” the organisation said in response to the allegations. “Popular Front members and associates have never indulged in any sort of violence anywhere and it has never funded protesters anywhere with any amount of money. Let the ‘investigators’ produce substantiating evidence to support their allegations,” the statement said. “The media reports quoting the Enforcement Directorate have dragged the name of an NGO working in the field of village development into the financial dealing of Popular Front without any evidence. A few reputed Supreme Court lawyers like Kapil Sibal, Dushyant Dave and Indira Jaising were also alleged to have received money from PFI to instigate anti-CAA protests,” the statement read. “Popular Front outrightly denies all such allegations levelled with the intention of maligning the organisation and also the other individuals and organisations,” the statement further added.

 Hope ‘sabka...’ motto guides CAA: UK | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Outgoing British high commissioner Dominic Asquith Thursday expressed hope the Indian government will continue to address the CAA-related issues in the spirit of its manifesto commitment of “with all, development for all and trust of all”. He also said that even after Brexit, UK will remain India’s most important European partner and that the two sides will see expansion of trade diplomatic and security activities. “There is protest in every single democracy. I refer back to the ‘with all, development for all, and trust of all (sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas)’ as the objective set by this government and I am sure that in that ‘trust of all’ (is) the trust that it will be addressing the concerns that have been expressed about the CAA. But that is for the Indian government to deal with,” he said. He also said the British side had not received any proposal from India to visit J&K following the repeal of Article 370 and that UK diplomats remained willing to visit J&K. Briefing the media, he also expressed regret over threats that, he said, Indian high commission may have felt because of violent protests on its premises. “I am glad to note that the last two protests have passed off without serious concern. That balance between the right to protest and ensuring that they don’t cross the line to illegality is a balance that is always difficult to maintain,” he said, adding that Metropolitan Police has the responsibility to do so. On the anti-CAA resolutions in the European parliament, he said that parliaments as key democratic institutions have the habit to debate a variety of subjects.

"CAA-NRC opponents too plan door-to-door, street-corner meets | Nagpur News - Times of India","Nagpur: Even as organizers appealed for door-to-door and street-corner awareness campaigns at non-Muslim homes across the city on the perils of CAA-NRC, they announced the Nagpur Shaheenbagh protest from February 3 at Teka Naka’s Farooq Nagar ground. The announcements came during the last day of anti-CAA-NRC dharna organized by Jamiat Ulema Hind at Samvidhan Square on Thursday. A crowd of around 1,000 protesters, which had an equal number of men and women, had gathered at the venue. Salman Ahmed, one of the coordinators for all protests taking place in city, said the dharna is ending but ‘Ethezaz’ (dissent) will continue. “Now we have to go door-to-door or hold street-corner meets to reach out to our non-Muslim brothers and sisters and tell them how CAA, NRC and NPR are not just anti-Muslims but anti-India. It is against all Indians,” he said. Asked how the proposed campaign on the lines of Sangh Parivar’s nationwide support meet will be carried out, Ahmed said it will have to be done carefully ensuring peace is maintained. “It has to be done with specific define and design and not just anywhere. We will have to ensure we have trustworthy friends in company. The campaign will be coordinated by non-Muslims brothers and sisters who love the concept of Indian Constitution which to promotes communal harmony and fraternity to establish peace in society,” said Ahmed. The organizers are looking forward to collective activity with support from different organizations. In his speech, Ahmed said the government was targeting a $5 trillion economy but was unable to contain hatred and cold war. “All our infrastructure and investments are of no use if this ongoing cold war is not contained. They are pushing the country towards a civil war,” he said. Ahmed invoked the holy Koran to eliminate “the seeds of hatred and the poison which are now deep rooted in society. The community must know follow the commandments (Koran) of Allah and teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to achieve the bigger objective of eliminating hatred spread by evil”. Earlier, the protesters had taken out a rally to Variety Square where they paid homage to mark the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Lawyer Akshay Samarth, in his address at Samvidhan Square, said the assassination of Gandhi was a conspiracy to divide the nation. “Those who follow the doctrine of Godse have divided the nation. They are applying the British formula of divide and rule,” he said. Jamiat Ulema Hind Siraj Ahmed said that those in power must not think this will remain forever. “Before them, there were Pharaohs, Hitler, Mussolini who thought they would rule forever but were proved wrong,” he said.

The human chain, organised by several groups under Tamil Makkal Otrumai Medai, stretched from Tiruvottiyur to Tambaram. The protest that lasted about an hour slowed down traffic at Thousand Lights, Gemini flyover, DMS, Nandanam, Saidapet and Pallavaram. Women and children took part in large numbers, raising slogans against CAA, NRC, bearing the tricolour. Police said about 3,300 people stood from Periyar Statue in Teynampet to Gemini flyover. The protesters were joined by various political leaders at different points along the 30-km stretch on Anna Salai and GST Road. They slammed the Centre for forcing CAA, NRC and NPR on the citizens and called it out for discriminating against one particular religion. Dubbing it a murder of the Constitution the protesters said the CAA and NRC were aimed at dividing people along the lines of religion. “We are here to condemn passage of the Bill that became an Act, as a piece of legislation that was forced upon the country without debate and consensus,” said Mumtaz, a protester from Nungambakkam. They called out to people travelling by MTC buses to join them in the protest and distributed pamphlets about the controversial Act. Manithaneya Makkal Katchi founder M H Jawahirullah, who participated in the protest, said it was organised on the day of Gandhi’s martydom as the CAA, NPR and NRC are diametrically opposite to his ideals. “Gandhiji wanted an inclusive India. The CAA, NRC and NPR are divisive and discriminate people on the basis of religion. NPR has the potential of snatching citizenship of the poor and downtrodden people. Moreover, it exposes the private information of individuals.” Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K S Alagiri, VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan, CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan, VCK deputy general secretary Vanni Arasu, MPs Nawaz Gani and Su Venkatesan, and many district secretaries of the DMK joined the human chain at various positions starting from Wallajah Road-Anna Salai junction to Tambaram bus terminus.

"Fight against CAA &amp; NRC will go on, vow Medha &amp; Aishe Ghosh | Bhopal News - Times of India","Bhopal: JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh on Thursday joined the anti-CAA Satyagraha at Bhopal’s Iqbal Maidan and condemned the shooting of a protesting Jamia student in Delhi. “Union minister Anurag Thakur had recently said ‘Desh ke gaddaro ko goli, maro ***** ko’, and his man did it today in Jamia,” she said. “I condemn this attack. This has only strengthened the motivation of students and JNU will not bow in any situation. There will be no change in our fight against wrong policies despite attacks by RSS,” said Ghosh. Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar, Madhya Pradesh minority affairs minister Arif Aqueel, Congress MLA Arif Masood, Archbishop Leo Cornelio and some Jamia students were among the protesters at Iqban Maidan on Thursday. “This movement should not stop till the objective is achieved. We have been fighting for justice (for Sardar Sarovar Dam evictees) for years, which has forced the government to listen to us. Likewise, the protest against CAA and NRC should continue,” said Patkar. Ghosh alleged that Delhi Police hasn’t done anything about the violence on students at JNU. “I was attacked yet police made me the accused.

We will keep fighting,” said Ghosh. She demanded to know the logic behind CAA and NRC, and why the BJP-led Centre wanted Indians to prove citizenship. “We got citizenship 70 years ago.

"CAA illogical, immoral, ill-timed: Ramchandra Guha | Ahmedabad News - Times of India","Ahmedabad: Historian Ramchandra Guha called the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), that was passed in the winter session of Parliament, “illogical, immoral and ill-timed”. Guha, also a biographer of Gandhi, delivered a public lecture on ‘What would Gandhi make of India today?’ in Ahmedabad on Saturday. Speaking on Hindu-Muslim harmony as one of the four pillars of Gandhi’s idea of Swaraj, Guha said, “Even if Gandhi had never existed, any morally upright consciences, democratic citizens who believe in the Constitution, would non-violently oppose CAA. The act is illogical, immoral and ill-timed.” “It is illogical because it completely excludes the largest group of refugees in India who have travelled from Sri Lanka, many of whom are actually Hindus. It is immoral because its entire phrasing discriminates against one community, Muslims. In conjunction with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), it makes any Indian Muslim fearful and insecure,” Guha added. “Look at the phrasing. It is as if we have many neighbours but only those that are Muslim majority are discriminating and every refugee except someone who is a Muslim is welcome here. It is absolutely immoral. I am no constitutional expert, but even if the Supreme Court upholds it, it should be resisted because it is utterly immoral,” Guha said. Guha also termed the Act be ill-timed, saying, “It is ill-timed because of the perennial state of the country now, unemployment levels at a 45-year high, agrarian distress, all kinds of other issues to be solved…Of course, Gandhi would have opposed it.” About the CAA in the context of the northeast India, Guha said, “The Northeast is a part of India which always had difficulties because of geographic isolation.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"CAA will affect overseas Goans, says Churchill | Goa News - Times of India","Margao: Voicing his opposition to CAA, Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao Thursday said that the “unconstitutional” Act was a prelude to NRC which he claimed would spell trouble to 70 percent of overseas Goans. Stating that his support to the BJP government was only because of chief minister Pramod Sawant as he hails from the “weaker section of society”, Alemao said it has always been issue-based. Explaining the rationale behind his anti-CAA stance, Alemao said, “As they say, give them an inch and they will take a mile. If CAA is allowed to happen, NRC will definitely follow.” Elaborating on his concerns, Alemao, while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event at Ravindra Bhavan here, said, “Today there's Brexit happening.

"States can express opinion, can’t oppose NPR: Nalsar vice-chancellor | Hyderabad News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: Vice-chancellor of National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (Nalsar), Hyderabad, Faizan Mustafa tells Sribala Vadlapatla that citizenship is not just about borders, it is about membership to a political community adhering to the same values. CAA, NPR and NRC are opposed because they are in violation of the constitutional spirit. As these subjects are enshrined in central list of legislation, states can only say that their legislative powers are being limited. Can the states who are opposing the NPR stop its implementation?No way, because subjects like NPR and citizenship are in the central list of the enacting legislation. States may express their political opinion, at the same time they are implementing agencies for NPR and Census. As per the legislation, if states refuse to implement it, or if there is any disturbance, the Centre can impose presidential rule. Centre cannot do this through an app, it must depend on states. This again is a political decision. Even on the subjects which are in the concurrent list, when state and Centre legislate on the same subject, the central legislation prevails over state legislation. There is debate that NPR and NRC are the same, what is your take on this?If Census and NPR are the same, as some politicians have claimed, then why did the central government make huge allocations separately for both Census and NPR? The Vajpayee government made some changes through rules in the Citizenship Act. Frequent amendments are confusing the people. When the first NPR was done during the Congress regime, there was no problem in the question format. The eight additional documents said to be added in the present NPR are a cause of concern. Yes, NPR is very much a subset of NRC. The list prepared in NPR will be noted in NRC. Anyone who is listed to be suspicious, will not make it to the NRC. The Centre has said that there is no need to show documents for NPR.They may not ask for the documents but asking for Aadhaar number or PAN number is the same as asking for documents. The Supreme Court has said don’t link Aadhaar with any scheme, but in reality, what is happening is that the government uses Aadhaar for everything. The same will be the case with NPR or at least that is the apprehension of many. The fear is that such documents or information needed may not be available, which ultimately will lead to loss of citizenship. The arbitrary power of lower rank officials who will visit our houses to decide on our citizenship should be questioned. Has any other country conducted an NRC-like exercise?No, no country has conducted a similar exercise with such a large population. Most states give national identity cards. Take NRC in Assam. It was the Hindu population that was impacted. Those who submitted documents and became part of NRC, have not been given any identity cards so far. So, what is its purpose? Do you think CAA is a constitutionally valid law and can the state approach courts against it?Citizenship is not a concept confined to borders or geographical area. It is basically membership to a political community. States can challenge it (CAA), but the Supreme Court goes by the narrowed down technical grounds to give judgement and it will be passed. What the Kerala chief minister said was his political intention, but the central Act will prevail. States can only object. In such cases, their legislative powers will be questioned. But this is an unprecedented scenario. CAA is being opposed by many because it is violative of basic principles of the Constitution. In fact, there was discussion in the constituent assembly at that time whether all Hindus across the world who are stateless, should be given Indian citizenship, but the idea was rejected. Today, minorities living in the countries in India’s neighbourhood are not stateless. Then why are we conferring citizenship on them is also one argument. What are other major objections to CAA?There is no consensus on this Act itself is the proof that it is violation of constitutional spirit. The minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghan are allowed. There are hardly minorities in Afghanistan. In that case, Sri Lanka should have been part of CAA as there are many Tamil Hindus who want to settle in India. Despite Pakistan and Bangladesh being Muslim countries, religion is not a criteria for getting citizenship there. Afghanistan is much more advanced than us in framing citizenship rules in 1922. I guess here the chronology of intended actions was not right. They should have done NPR, NRC and then CAA. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

" Brexit will oust 73 members, many of them anti-CAA, from Euro parliament | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: When the European parliament meets again at the end of March to vote on India’s CAA legislation, the 73 British MEPs, many of whom are believed to be behind the numerous resolutions against India, won’t be present. With Brexit kicking in on Friday, all 73 British MEPs would have left. To that extent, the deferment of the vote in the European parliament was a last hurrah that was aborted. Gaitri Kumar, India’s envoy to Brussels, has met all the groups who have sponsored the drafts in the past couple of days to explain the Indian perspective. Some of the groups have already been convinced of the Indian argument. The resolutions, sources here believe, have been sponsored by Pakistan via some of the British Labour and Liberal Democrat MEPs who belong to groups like S&D and Renew Europe which have sponsored these resolutions. Foreign minister S Jaishankar will be visiting Brussels in mid-February in preparation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit there for the India-EU summit on March 13. Some of the European lawmakers said they would wait to get answers from him before voting on the resolution. In addition, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla also wrote to the president of the European Parliament, David Maria Sassoli: ""As members of Inter Parliamentary Union, we should respect sovereign processes of fellow legislatures, especially in democracies."" However, the issue has not died, merely been kicked down the road. For Pakistan, this exercise keeps the issues in play, particularly because they have been portrayed as being infringement on human rights and Islamophobia. The Indian defence centered around the argument that the CAA process is internal to India. In addition, it is being debated hotly on the streets, in the states and in the courts. There are 60 petitions pending in Supreme Court against this amendment. The government’s view has been that the entire process would be allowed to run the course of popular and judicial scrutiny. For the European parliament to be passing resolutions on something that is undergoing scrutiny in India, would be disingenuous. But within the Indian government, certain quarters say the commission and member states should do their bit with their own MEPs, given the extensive briefings etc. that their diplomats have been accorded by the Indian government. Sources said, “As fellow democracies, the EU Parliament should not take actions that call into question the rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures in other regions of the world.” In addition, India said the European countries themselves have set up their own conditions for naturalisation that is dependent on their own context, with their own criteria. India’s context is unique, given the circumstances of its partition and the politico-religious context that exists in this subcontinent. “Every society that fashions a pathway to naturalisation, contemplates both a context and criteria. This is not discrimination. In fact, European societies have followed the same approach.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
All-women sit-in against CAA/NRC at Ballarpur today | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Chandrapur: Muslim women under the banner of Women Against NRC and Muslim Ekta Manch have geared up for a massive agitation against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register for Citizens (NRC).

Shakila Parveen, district president of Jamaat-e-Islami’s women’s wing, alleged that the CAA has been brought to “rectify” the failure of NRC in Assam. “There are many burning issues like poverty, unemployment, health and education in the country. At a time when the Centre has failed on all these fronts and country’s GDP has dropped to a record low of 4.7%, the government is busy in pitting one community against other,” said Parveen. “It is a well-planned conspiracy and the ruling party is sowing seeds of discord among communities for its political gains,” she charged. Parveen also accused the ruling BJP of being inclined to fascism and using Hitler’s tactics to persecute Muslims in India. Humera Khan from Muslim Ekta Mach informed that over 3,000 women from all major towns in Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts will gather at Ballarpur and stage the daylong sit-in to oppose the CAA, National Population Register (NRP) and NRC on Friday.

" All-party meet: PM Modi says govt ready to discuss all issues; oppn raises CAA protests, 'worsening' economy | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The opposition on Thursday raised the issue of anti-CAA protests at an all party meeting and accused the government of ""arrogance"" in not reaching out to protesters, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted his dispensation is open to discuss all matters in Parliament's budget session beginning from Friday. PM Modi also called for a ""greater focus"" on economic issues in the session and how India can gain in the prevailing global situation, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters after the meeting, attended by 26 parties. The opposition raised a host of issues including the nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, ""worsening"" economic situation and ""rising"" unemployment. They also demanded the release of detained political figures in Jammu and Kashmir. PM @narendramodi chairs All Party Meeting ahead of the Budget session of Parliament. https://t.co/p4oF79x3qF— PIB India (@PIB_India) 1580374859000Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad told reporters that opposition parties sought immediate release of former state chief minister Farooq Abdullah so that he could attend the session from Friday. Anand Sharma of the Congress added that the issue of some ""incendiary"" statements made by BJP leaders during the Delhi poll campaign was also raised and Modi was asked to intervene in the matter. The Election Commission on Thursday barred Union minister Anurag Thakur and BJP MP Parvesh Verma from campaigning for three and four days respectively for their objectionable remarks. Joshi said the prime minister told the leaders that parties should not confine themselves to mere ""charcha"" (debate) but should have rich and structured discussion on every issue. In his concluding remarks, Modi welcomed the suggestions of most members that the session should focus on the prevailing economic situation in the country, an official statement later said. ""Most of the members have asked for discussion on the economic situation concerning the country. I welcome this and we need to discuss the economic issues as suggested by you all. We should focus on how we can turn the global scenario in favour of India,"" he said. ""In this budget session and in the beginning of the new year, if we can give a proper direction to the country's economy, it would be in the best interest of the country,"" he said, according to the statement. Referring to various other issues raised by opposition parties, Modi said there should be an open discussion on all. He asked the leaders at the meeting to see to it that they contribute to increasing the productivity of the session and Parliament. ""This is about the productivity of the session and the Parliament. In the last two sessions, we saw the increased productivity and the great public response in favour of it. As people's representatives, it is our responsibility to increase the productivity of the House, while we discuss all issues with an open mind,"" he said. Asked about the opposition's charge that the government is being arrogant in not reaching out to anti-CAA protestors, Joshi noted that the bill was passed by Parliament following a long discussion and asked rival parties to introspect their role in these protests. The BJP has accused the Congress and other opposition parties of inciting protests and violence against the law which, the ruling party has asserted, does not affect the citizenship of any Indian. In his remarks, Azad said Parliament's sessions have been shortened gradually by the government. He said opposition parties are willing to back the government on its legislative agenda if it is in national and public interest. He then accused the government of focussing merely on the passage of its bills and spoke about the nation-wide protests against the CAA. ""We brought the government's attention to these protests. The government has displayed arrogance by not reaching out to protestors to hear their concerns... Economic condition is worsening, GDP growth is down and unemployment is at its peak,"" he said. Joshi rejected the charge that the government has been reducing the duration of sessions and noted that opposition parties have often opposed the move to extend sessions. The government's legislation agenda for the budget session has 45 bills, including seven financial items and two ordinances, Joshi said. DMK's T R Baalu shared the concerns of other opposition parties and also spoke about problems of farmers in Tamil Nadu. The budget session will conclude on April 3 with a recess in between. The budget will be presented on Saturday. In Video:Ready to discuss all issues: PM Modi at all-party meetDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" CAA internal matter of India, will continue to remain engaged with European Parliament members: MEA | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Asserting that the CAA is an internal matter of India, the Ministry of External Affairs said it has noted the European Parliament's decision to not put to vote a resolution on the citizenship law on Thursday and will continue to engage with the MEPs on the issue.

Bihar: Kanhaiya's anti-CAA 'yatra' creates a flutter in Champaran | Patna News - Times of India,"BETTIAH/MOTIHARI: Amid high drama, CPM leader Kanhaiya Kumar set off on his ‘Save Constitution, Save Citizenship Satyagraha yatra’ from Mahatma Gandhi’s Bhitiharwa Ashram in West Champaran on Thursday. The former JNUSU president battled a haze of indigo blues on the Gandhi’s martyrdom anniversary marked by cancellation of his scheduled public meeting at Bettiah, rumours of his arrest or detention and a flood of fake news to garland the idols of Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi. Amid high drama, CPM leader #KanhaiyaKumar set off on his ‘Save Constitution, Save Citizenship Satyagraha yatra’ fr… https://t.co/Stmc5ylSN3— TOI Patna (@TOIPatna) 1580393156000He addressed a large crowd assembled outside the Bhitiharwa Ashram before being escorted beyond the boundaries of West Champaran via a circuitous route that dodged the waiting crowds near Bettiah. Greeting another large crowd at the Sports Club in Motihari later in the afternoon, Kanhaiya alleged that he was stopped at Bhitiharwa in a conspiracy that was thwarted by Jan-Samarthan ( people’s support). Kanhaiya’s Champaran yatra was preceded by clashes at Bettiah’s Meena Bazar on Wednesday when Bharat bandh supporters protesting against CAA-NRC clashed with shopkeepers. An ugly situation was saved by the prompt action by an alert district administration. “The permission for his public meeting (at the Aerodrome grounds) here was cancelled as meeting grounded was not adequately barricaded,” West Champaran DM Nilesh Ramchandra Deore told TOI. The Bettiah meeting cancelled, a crowd began assembling at Kudiya Kothi, site of a Raj-era indigo factory, 6 km from Bettiah as word-of-mouth and WhatsApp messages said that Kanhaiya would hold a meeting here on his way back from Bhitiharwa. Police kept vigil at Kudiya Kothi. Meanwhile, Kanhaiya – after spending the night at his CPM comrade Om Prash Kranti’s house in Chanpatia- was stopped from leaving Kranti’s residence at 8 am. Allowed an hour later, as he drove out towards Bhitiharwa, a handful of BJP supporters shouted “ Go Back Kanhaiya’ slogans near the Sikrahana bridge near Chanpatia. A massive crowd greeted Kanhaiya, accompanied by his fellow JNUite and Congress MLA from Kadwa ( Katihar) Shakeel Ahmad Khan, as he entered the ashram gate to pay obeisance to Gandhi ji on his martyrdom day. A CPM press release claimed that he was arrested. “ Was stopped” would be Kanhaiya’s statement later at Motihari. Thanking the Bhitiharwa crowd for coming in such numbers on Gandhi’s day of martyrdom, Kanhaiya said that the Mahatma was murdered because of his adherence to “ Ishwar-Allah Tero Naam, Sabko Sanmati De Bhagwan” hymn and credo. “ Today we are in a situation where hatred is being fanned, a Hindu-Muslim divide is being deepened....people in their own country are being considered second class citizens.” “I was supposed to go to Motihari from here after a programme in Bettiah. But Police, administration say: ‘aapka permission cancel kar diya gaya hai,” Kanhaiya’s statement evoked a “ Modi ji ka police hai” reaction from the crowd. A commotion erupted, only to be calmed by Kanhaiya. “He had the permission ( to address the people at Bhitiharwa),” DM Deore said, adding that the circulation of fake news ( on the contrary) was unfortunate. Meanwhile at Kudiya Kothi, the ‘Kanhaiya arrested’ rumours and fake news were negated by ‘Facebook live’ streaming that encaptured the assembled crowd huddled in groups glued to Kanhaiya’s Bhitiharwa speech on smartphones. An hour later, the crowd at the erstwhile indigo factory grounds began to disperse as news filtered in that Kanhaiya had been whisked out of the district through a diversionary route via the Triveni canal to Mainatar- Ghogha- Sariswa- Piparpainti bridge onto to the NH 28 B on the Sugauli- Raxaul road enroute Motihari. At Motihari, describing the CAA-NRC as ‘black law’, Kanhaiya said: “ We do not acknowledge a government that does not consider us as citizens.” He appealed that people assemble at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on February 29 at the culmination of his yatra that he has set out from Champaran to cover Bihar. Talking to TOI over phone, Kanhaiya said, “The administration is under pressure and officials were intentionally creating trouble to stop me from holding public meet. This is undemocratic.” Even Shakeel alleged there was nothing wrong with the protest site at Bettiah and they had followed all the instructions given by the administration. “District administration officials inspected the site with me on Wednesday and first demanded tricolour to be removed from the stage. In late evening they cancelled our permission to hold a public gathering there citing security reasons, but the fact is they are working on instruction of a particular political party.” (With inputs from Sheezan Nezami in Patna) Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

JBT teachers scam: HC asks Delhi government to respond to Chautala's plea for early release | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has asked the AAP government to respond to a plea by former Haryana chief minister O P Chautala claiming that his prayer for early release from jail in a teachers' recruitment scam has not been considered by the authorities despite judicial order. Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar asked the Delhi government to file its response on the plea and listed the matter for further hearing on February 28. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) chief, who is 84 and lodged in Tihar jail to serve 10-year jail term in the JBT scam, has been seeking special remission on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi as notified by the central government. The high court on December 18, 2019 asked the Delhi government to consider afresh Chautala's plea for early release from jail. It had set aside the state's April 3, 2019 order of rejecting his plea. Advocate Amit Sahni, appearing for Chautala, argued that despite the December 18 directions of the court, the Delhi government has not decided the case for special remission and the state cannot prolong it indefinitely. He said the government was asked to comply with the order in two weeks but it has not been complied with even after 40 days and sought direction to the authorities to comply with it. Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra submitted that in view of upcoming elections in the capital, the model code of conduct is in force and the state level committee would examine Chautala's case after the new government is formed. In the December order, the court said that in view of mandate of law and the fact that he was aged and has completed 50 per cent of his actual sentence period, the court was of the opinion that he was eligible to have his case considered by the State Committee for special remission in terms of the guidelines prescribed under the Notification. The court had made it clear that it had not expressed any opinion on the entitlement of Chautala for early release. His plea was earlier opposed by the Delhi government, which had said Chautala was not eligible for the relief as he was convicted under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act and as per the proviso of the government notification, such convicts cannot be granted special remission. Chautala had claimed in his plea that he should be considered for release from jail in view of his old age and disability as also the period of seven years already undergone by him behind bars. The petition had referred to the central government's July 18, 2018, special remission notification, by which the relief could be granted to certain categories of prisoners and they were to be released in three phases with effect from October last year. As per the notification, the special remission has to be given to women and transgender convicts of 55 years of age who have completed 50 per cent of their actual jail term, male convicts of 60 years of age and who have completed half of their sentence period. The relief has to be given to physically challenged/ disabled prisoners with 70 per cent disability and more and who have completed 50 per cent of their actual jail term and those who are terminally ill and the convicts who have completed two-thirds of their jail term, it said. However, the special remission was not to be given to those who have been convicted for heinous offences or under POTA, UAPA, TADA, POCSO Act, money laundering, FEMA, NDPS and anti-corruption act. ""Considering the age, disability and period of incarceration, the case of Chautala falls under two clauses of the notification but since the authorities are biased towards him, his case is not considered in furtherance of the notification despite the fact that he has already undergone more than seven years of incarceration under the PC Act,"" the plea had said. Chautala, his son Ajay Chautala and 53 others, including IAS officer Sanjiv Kumar, were convicted and sentenced in the case of illegal recruitment of 3,206 junior basic teachers (JBT) in 2000. They all were sentenced to varying jail terms in the case by a special CBI court in January 2013. Kumar, the then director of primary education in Haryana, had initially exposed the scam after he filed a plea in the Supreme Court. Later, he was also found to be involved in the scam during a CBI probe. The others who were given 10-year jail terms are Madan Lal Kalra, Durga Dutt Pradhan, Bani Singh, Ram Singh and Daya Saini. Apart from them, a convict was handed a five-year jail sentence and the rest 44 were given four years of imprisonment. Among the 55 convicts, 16 were women officials.

Anti-CAA stir: Shaheen Bagh echoes heard in Moradabad | Bareilly News - Times of India,"BAREILLY: Holding placards and raising slogans, scores of women on Wednesday thronged Eidgah ground in Moradabad, demanding rollback of the newly enacted citizenship law and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), only two days after seven women booked for staging a sit-in near Moradabad-Aligarh highway. Additional superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand and additional district magistrate (executive) Lakshmi Shankar Singh visited the protesters in a bid to persuade them, but to no avail. Stating that police force were deployed at the Eidgah ground to deal with untoward situation, the ASP warned that an FIR would be registered against those who started sit-in without taking prior permission from the district administration. The ASP told TOI that as the protesters defied section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) that prohibits unlawful assembly and is imposed in the city, legal action would be taken against the protesters. “Eidgah ground is a religious place. Had people been gathered there for a religious purpose, no action would have been required. But, since they were protesting against the CAA and NRC at Eidgah, appropriate action would be taken against them,” said the police officer. The ASP said the number of women assembled at Eidgah was much smaller than the men. “None of them have taken prior permission for the assembly.” Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party leaders — local MP ST Hasan and former MLA Yusuf Ansari — visited the protesters to extend their support. “CAA is unconstitutional and the Centre will have to rollback it back,” said Ansari. In the wake of ongoing protest, markets in parts of old city, including Karula, Jama Masjid area and Eidgah localities, remained closed on Wednesday. Motivated by the ongoing protest in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, scores of people, especially women, started turning up to the streets against the CAA and NRC. Similarly, in Sambhal district, a sit-in started on January 24 at Pakka Bagh in Nakhasa area is still going on.

"Yashwant Sinha blames government for CAA violence in UP, claims BJP will lose Delhi polls | Agra News - Times of India","AGRA: Former Union minister Yashwant Sinha, who was stopped by the Aligarh administration from going to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) to address students, on Wednesday, blamed the Centre for the anti-CAA protests and violence which has erupted in parts of the country, especially in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh (UP). He also claimed that the BJP will lose the February 8 Delhi elections. The language being used by the BJP leaders in their campaign for Delhi elections is a proof of their impending defeat, Sinha claimed while speaking to the media. “People use derogatory language when they feel frustrated,” he said, adding that the party wants to fight Delhi’s election with a communal agenda. Some BJP leaders have been pulled up by the election commission for making objectionable remarks during their campaign for party candidates in Delhi. Sinha added that such kind of communal atmosphere was not present during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s rule. “Vajpayee ji never tried to divide the communities,” Sinha said. Sinha, who stated that the local administration did not allow him to visit the AMU, also made an appeal to anti-CAA protesters to express dissent in a peaceful way, and not give the government any opportunity to inflict violence. “The Centre was responsible for the violence in UP and Delhi varsities,” he said, adding that there is nationwide “unrest” due to the enactment of CAA and talk about implementation of NRC across the country. “People are mistaken if they think they can rule the country on the basis of lies and violence,” he said, stating that “Nathuram Godse’s ideology will never be accepted by this nation”. On the upcoming Budget, the former finance minister said, “All expectations are dead now. The economy is passing through its worst-ever crisis and its revival looks very unlikely. Demonetisation was absolutely wrong and the way the government implemented GST was wrong too. These two steps are mainly responsible for the current state of the economy.” On Wednesday, Sinha was in Aligarh during a stopover of his march from Mumbai to Delhi’s Rajghat for propagating Mahatma Gandhi’s ideology. He said the 21-day-long journey will conclude in Delhi on Thursday, and the message is to persuade the government to withdraw CAA and not implement NRC.

" In India, protesters and Modi tussle over who can claim Gandhi | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The protesters who are challenging Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-centric vision for India liberally evoke the legacy of a national icon: Mohandas K Gandhi, who wanted a country where Hindus and Muslims lived together and a secular government kept the peace. So it has been galling for them to watch Modi and his allies claim Gandhi's mantle to promote their own agenda, including the issue that set off the protests — a contentious citizenship law that critics say blatantly discriminates against Muslims. With Thursday the 72nd anniversary of Gandhi's assassination, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party have deployed his name and image at an ever-faster clip in an information campaign meant to counter the protests and drum up support for the citizenship law. PM Narendra Modi, President Ram Nath Kovind pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi on 72nd death anniversary""We only implemented what the great freedom fighters had wished to do. We have done Gandhiji's bidding,"" Modi said this month in defense of the law, adding a Hindi suffix indicating respect. But the protesters say that the government's actions are directly at odds with Gandhi's goal of a secular, pluralistic India. Since his landslide reelection in May, Modi has made several bold moves that thrilled Indians who long for a Hindu state. He canceled the statehood of the predominantly Muslim territory of Kashmir, and thousands were arrested there without charge. His party championed a court ruling that allowed a Hindu temple to be built on the site of a centuries-old mosque, touching on a dangerous sectarian flash point. And now the party has pushed through the citizenship law, which favors immigrants of every major South Asian religion but Islam. Critics fear that if the law were combined with a citizenship test, Muslims could be disenfranchised, stripped of their nationality or their right to vote. ""Modi invokes everything about Gandhi except Hindu-Muslim harmony, and this was the most crucial element of his work,"" said Ramachandra Guha, a historian who wrote an authoritative biography of Gandhi and who was arrested at a recent protest. ""You can't have Einstein without relativity,"" Guha said. ""You can't have Darwin without evolution. And you can't have Gandhi without Hindu-Muslim harmony."" Clashes broke out at some early protests, but more recent demonstrations have been peaceful, deliberately drawing on Gandhi's example of nonviolent resistance. The government has responded with both force and a virulent disinformation campaign. (Officials have denied cracking down on peaceful protests, despite many images and witness accounts of violence) In recent days, a protest camp of hundreds of women in the Shaheen Bagh neighborhood of New Delhi has come to symbolize the movement. Officials have said the women are radicals or have been paid to be there, and many believe a police crackdown is imminent. Throughout his six years in power, Modi has frequently linked himself to Gandhi's legacy, saying he was ""made of the same soil"" as the champion of Indian independence. His vice president has called it ""divine coincidence"" that both men were born in the state of Gujarat. Modi has even used Gandhi's signature round, wire-rimmed spectacles as a logo for his ""Clean India"" sanitation campaign. Modi has also drawn on Gandhi's globally resonant image overseas as he cuts military alliances and trade deals. In October, as he wrapped up meetings at the UN General Assembly, he wrote an Opinion piece for The New York Times calling on the world to learn from Gandhi's teachings. But one fact omitted by the prime minister was that Gandhi was killed by a Hindu nationalist — a man nurtured by the same hard-line ideological group that shaped Modi: the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The assassin, Nathuram Godse, believed that Gandhi had betrayed Hindus by being too conciliatory to Muslims. That line is still echoed today by Modi's party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is filled with officials who revere Godse and see Gandhi as a traitor. One party official, Pragya Singh Thakur, who has repeatedly called Godse a patriot, was arrested in 2008 in connection with a mosque bombing that killed 10 people. Modi's government dropped some of the most serious terrorism charges against her, and she was elected to Parliament in an overwhelming victory last year. ""The ideology that killed him is now trying to claim him,"" said Tushar Gandhi, a great-grandson of Gandhi who has supported the protests. ""It's nauseating to see them snatch my great-grandfather's legacy, but at the same time I take pride that even a person like Modi must seek refuge in a person like my great-grandfather,"" Gandhi said. Modi's party is hardly the first Indian political group to evoke Gandhi's image for its own gain. His portrait hangs everywhere, and most Indians proudly revere him as a model of morality and conscience. For Modi, cultivating the association helps him attract Indian voters who have traditionally been wary of his party's sectarianism. A pamphlet recently distributed by the party, addressing what it calls ""misinformation"" about the citizenship law, features Gandhi's image along with a quote from him appearing to suggest that he would have supported the law. But the quote — about India welcoming Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan — is taken out of context, and critics contend that it is actually itself misinformation. Originally, Gandhi was excoriating Hindus who questioned Muslims' loyalty to India. When contacted, the pamphlet's editor, a BJP leader named Shiv Shakti Bakshi, said he had gotten the quote from the Home Ministry, which is led by Modi's closest confidant, Amit Shah. Shah has boasted about the party's talent for manipulating imagery and political messages, saying in one speech: ""We are capable of delivering any message we want to the public, whether sweet, sour, true or fake."" The BJP's media operations have been fully mobilized against the protesters, who have been depicted as violent, ""anti-national"" and exclusively Muslim, even though a diverse group of Indians has participated. In a widely circulated Twitter post, the party's social media chief, Amit Malviya, accused some protesters of chanting ""long live Pakistan,"" playing on stereotypes that Indian Muslims' true loyalty is to India's neighbor and archrival, which was founded as an Islamic state. Malviya's claim was debunked, but he refused to take the post down. He declined to comment. ""They've branded them anti-nationals, a term that has caught on in the last five or six years to say that anyone that is anti-government is against the nation,"" said Chitranshu Tewari, an analyst of the Indian news media. ""The government wants to create that link in people's minds, that the government and nation are one."" In some BJP-controlled states where protests have taken place, police have ransacked shops and homes belonging to Muslims, part of what one government official called an act of ""revenge."" In scenes reminiscent of Gandhi's struggle against British rule, protesters have been dragged from auto rickshaws as they arrived at demonstrations. Police officers have charged at people who were marching peacefully. The protest movement lacks the international support that gave Gandhi's campaign strength. But demonstrators are still clinging to their cause — and to Gandhi's methods. In Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, hundreds of women have braved the winter cold to shut down one of India's busiest thoroughfares, sleeping on thin sheets of cardboard. They began fasting this month to demonstrate against the citizenship law and to pay tribute to the last weeks of Gandhi's life, when he went without food to protest the sectarian violence wracking India and Pakistan. ""It's painful to us that Gandhi was protesting against a foreign occupation power and we now need to use these tactics against our own government, an Indian government,"" said Saima Khan, 33. She added that Gandhi had fought and died for an India where Muslims felt at home, an ideal that was now under threat. ""When people think about India, they think about Gandhi's India,"" she said.

"‘Need to save Preamble, it is like the Gospel’ | Kolkata News - Times of India","KOLKATA: The tenets of justice, liberty, equality and brotherhood — that are the pillars of the Indian Constitution as envisaged in the Preamble — are Christian concepts, feels archbishop Thomas D’Souza of the Archdiocese of Kolkata (Roman Catholic). Hence, the churches under the Archdiocese have upheld the Preamble in recent times to remind parishioners about its importance in these changing times. This came up again and again in informal discussions of priests at a three-day meet that ended on Wednesday. On Sunday, all the churches under the archdiocese read the Preamble after the mass to celebrate 70 years of the adoption of the Constitution. After that, the priests met for their annual three-day gathering to discuss matters related to churches and seek solutions to problems, if any. Both the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of North India have taken lead roles in organising anti-CAA programmes across the city. While Bishop Paritosh Canning of the CNI was seen leading a procession from St Paul’s Cathedral to Gandhi statue, D’Souza was seen bonding with leaders of other faiths in forming a human chain to uphold the Constitution. Vicar general Dominic Gomes took the lead in getting Preambles printed to be distributed at churches for reading after mass. “I feel that the Preamble is a very Christian concept because it upholds all that is said in the Bible. The Preamble is the gist of what the Bible says — liberty or freedom, equality and brotherhood are the pillars of Christianity. So I have been saying that the Preamble has gospel-like qualities,” D’Souza said. Priests have been saying in their prayer messages to parishioners that one can serve the country by following the Constitution and the same was is in the prayers. In context of the CAA/NRC, they advise the parishioners to stand by the poor and the vulnerable who may be scared over their inability to furnish the right documents. There are small church communities that are trying to dispel doubts and fears in this regard. “Jesus defined freedom as ‘truth that will set one free’. Our Preamble stresses on freedom or liberty and lauds gospel values,” said the vicar general. He quoted from Genesis 1.27 and said, “We are all brothers and sisters created in the image and likeness of God. This is akin to brotherhood or fraternity which the Preamble preaches.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Anti-CAA bandh evokes mixed response in Bihar | Patna News - Times of India,"PATNA: The Bharat bandh called by several organizations and supported by opposition political parties against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and proposed NRC evoked mixed response in the state on Wednesday. Barring a few incidents of minor clashes and road blockades in Patna and some other places in Sitamarhi and Bettiah, the bandh passed off peacefully. The protesters blocked Ashok Rajpath between Sabzibagh and PMCH and connecting lanes for several hours. Vehicles had to be diverted to Khazanchi Road and towards Macchua Toli, leading to massive jams before the blockade was lifted after several hours. Hindustani Awam Mocha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, former Union minister and RLSP president Upendra Kushwaha, Jantantrik Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) members led former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, CPI-ML’s Dhirendra Jha, CPM’s Arun Kumar Mishra and CPI’s Vijay Narayan Mishra joined the protests at Dakbungalow roundabout and disrupted traffic movement. Police resorted to minor lathicharge to clear the roundabout. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said some protesters were detained at Kotwali and Pirbahore police stations but there was no report of violence from anywhere in the district. In Nalanda, shops and business establishments, private educational institutions in certain localities remained partially closed but vehicular traffic remained almost unaffected. The 24X7 sit-ins by women against CAA, NPR and NRC continued in ten localities at Biharsharif. Addressing a gathering there, CPI (ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said chief minister Nitish Kumar should not confuse people by making opportunistic statements on CAA, NPR and NRC. Prompt police action prevented the ongoing stir from turning ugly when unruly elements tried to forcibly close down shops at the busy Meena Bazar in Bettiah. Shopkeepers opposed the agitators, who tried to forcefully close the market, which soon turned into a battleground. A brickbat from both sides made the situation explosive. However, Bettiah SP Nitasha Gudiya rushed to the spot and led a baton charge to chase away the violent mob. West Champaran DM Nilesh Ramchandra Deore also reached the market. The bandh had a mixed response at Bagaha, Valmikinagar and Ramnagar. Roads at Bettiah Chhavani were blocked. Three persons were detained in Bettiah as precautionary measures. In Khagaria, schools, colleges, government offices, shops and business establishments remained open. But hundreds of people of Marar village continued their indefinite dharna since January 27 in protest against the CAA, NRC and NPR. Bandh supporters disrupted traffic at several points in Gaya. They entered some colleges and got the classrooms emptied. Buses kept off roads in most parts of the district. In Ara, the main vegetable and fruit market was closed. CPI(ML) town secretary Dilraj Pritam said party workers blocked the Ara-Patna main road near the bus stand from 10am to 12 noon. JAP workers blocked the Ara-Patna road near Dharhara. The Ara-Mohania road was also blocked for some time by Bahujan Krantikari Morcha. Bhagalpur and Banka districts had a mixed response to the bandh. People from minority community staged dharna at some places while trade unions associated with Left parties took out a procession. Bandh supporters had heated arguments with those who wanted to keep their shops open. Traffic was disrupted at Champanala bridge. In Begusarai district, traffic was paralysed on NH-31 and between Barauni Zero Mile and railway station for several hours. However, markets, schools and colleges remained open. The bandh passed off peacefully in Sitamarhi baring a few stray incidents. At Bhaur, protesters and CAA supporters had a fight but the administration tackled the situation. The bandh had little impact in East Champaran. The protesters blocked the roads at several places but the blockade was lifted soon. Most of the shops in Motihari, Raxaul, Chakiya and Areraj were open. Traffic on NH-28 and 28A was normal. Road blockades were reported from Ramgarhwa, Turkaulia and Chakiya. A rally was taken out in Chakiya market. CAA supporters clashed with protesters at Dhaka and Motihari. (With inputs from districts) Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
European Union on CAA: European Parliament puts off vote on anti-CAA resolution | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In a relief for India, the European Parliament decided to postpone voting on a critical anti-CAA resolution to March even as it went ahead with the debate on Wednesday. The resolution was jointly introduced by five major groups across political leanings. The groups — from centre-right to far-left — account for more than 500 MEPs in the 751-member house. But when the resolution was taken up, of the 483 MEPs present, 271 voted to delay the vote on resolution, while 199 didn’t want it postponed and 13 abstained. An official source said India’s diplomatic offensive in the past few days, mainly in Brussels but here too with European envoys, resulted in a “diplomatic win” where the vote has been put off. The diplomatic drive was aimed at clearing up “misunderstandings” over the nature and implications of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The proposal to postpone the vote was brought by Michael Gahler, a member of the group of the centre-right European People’s Party, which has the largest number of MEPs (182). European Parliament schedules anti-CAA resolution for discussion: All you need to knowCAA resolution: India blames POK-born MEP With the vote kicked down the road, India has more time to work diplomatic channels and reach out to MEPs. India has also blamed POK-born MEP Shaffaq Mohammed for the resolution. Friends of India prevailed over the Friends of Pakistan in the European Parliament today. Strenuous efforts of outgoing British MEP Shaffaq Mohammad to have a resolution passed by the European Parliament against India on the penultimate day before Brexit were defeated, said a source. British MEPs will cease to be members of the European Parliament once Brexit comes into effect on Friday. The CAA is a matter internal to India and has been adopted through a due process through democratic means. We expect that our perspectives in this matter will be understood by all objective and fair-minded MEPs, the Indian source added. While the joint resolution dropped mention of Kashmir and UNSC resolutions, which one of the groups had mentioned, it saw no tempering of language. The joint resolution said it deeply regrets the adoption and implementation of CAA, which it says is discriminatory in nature and divisive. It further says CAA violates India international obligations and warns against increasing nationalism, which it claims has fuelled religious intolerance against Muslims. The resolution though was never going to be binding on the European Council, which is responsible for setting the political agenda and, as Indian officials have repeatedly pointed to, could not be seen as the EU official position. As France has already said, the European Parliament is an institution independent of member states and the European Commission. Sources said the EU was looking forward to the annual India-EU summit in March and the business and trade opportunities it might lead to. They didn’t rule out discussions with Indian authorities on the new act though. The problem for India is that the resolution still retains some of the nastiest bits from the earlier resolutions.

Mumbai: Women say no to cameras inside cabs | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: With a cab firm announcing it will launch 200 aggregator taxis this weekend with cameras fitted to capture images of passengers and drivers, several women commuters said they were uncomfortable with the idea of a camera pointed at them during a journey. TOI had first written six months ago about Palkhi Cabs planning to launch cabs with cameras filming the journey, with the objective of ensuring “women’s safety.” The cab firm’s management then faced certain “financial issues,” following which the launch was postponed by six months, sources said. “On February 1, we plan to have 200 cabs fitted with cameras to film inside (passengers and driver) and outside (road) the taxi. This will help us gather evidence in case there is any crime against women or drivers being harassed,” said Praful Shinde of Palkhi Cabs. He said the camera which captures clips of roads will help investigators or insurance agents in case of mishaps. Asha Divecha, a woman passenger, said it will be awkward travelling in a cab which has a camera facing you and you are not sure if it is on or off. “Such clips can be misused,” she said. Another woman commuter said, “One never knows what purpose that video clip will be used for. A lot of new mothers nurse their babies inside cabs. How does one know for sure the camera is switched off ?” A third commuter said if a driver intends to harass a commuter, he could always switch off the camera beforehand. Shinde said every cab will have zero surge price. “We have a tie-up with Yan Automation which will also provide free towing of car and repair/maintenance in case of any breakdown or emergency,” he stated. A senior official from the transport commissioner’s office said for installing such cams, the taxi aggregator has to take permission from RTO. “We have not issued any such permission to this operator,” he said. Shinde said the firm has made an application for the permission which was “pending.” “Our driver partners will seek permission before switching on the camera,” he stated, adding the clip could be live-streamed on mobile phones of passengers and their relatives. A cab driver said such cameras will also protect interest of drivers. The traffic police chief said they wouldn’t take action against cameras installed in app cabs unless a complaint is received. “As long as the passenger’s consent is taken, there shouldn’t be a legal issue. It is a must for the app cab to inform the passenger of the presence of cameras,” said joint commissioner, traffic, Madhukar Pandey. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Delhi elections 2020: BJP to raise local issues, but CAA and Shaheen Bagh to stay in focus | Delhi Election 2020 Election News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: While the Citizenship Amendment Act and anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh will continue to be in focus, BJP has decided to refer to local issues more frequently in its poll campaign to corner the Aam Aadmi Party. Complete coverage on Delhi electionsA senior BJP functionary said the last leg of the party’s campaign will be a mix of “nationalism” and “Hindutva”, apart from “exposing AAP’s failures” in providing basic amenities to the people of Delhi. “CAA and the protest at Shaheen Bagh, which is spreading to other parts of the city now, are resonating with the electorate. They will remain in focus. We will continue to attack AAP and Congress as both parties instigated people and created an atmosphere of fear. If they can talk about Shaheen Bagh, BJP will speak about safety and security of the majority,” said a senior party functionary. The senior functionary added, “Delhi elections cannot be solely contested on nationalism and talking about local issues that affect the daily lives of people is a must. We are talking about development, women’s security, water problem and state of education and health. On Wednesday, Naddaji spoke about guest teachers, Jan Lokpal, Swaraj Bill and Delhi Dialogue, which were AAP’s main poll planks in 2015.” Out of power from Delhi for 21 years, BJP is banking on Citizenship Amendment Act and protests against it to upstage AAP, which had won a massive mandate in the 2015 assembly polls winning 67 of the 70 seats. BJP bigwigs, including Union home minister Amit Shah and party national president Jagat Prakash Nadda, mention CAA and Shaheen Bagh protest vociferously in their speeches. Party functionaries said the issue changed the narrative of elections and people have started discussing it in their drawing rooms. “People have started reacting to these issues, which has energised the party workers. BJP is in a much more comfortable position compared with when the elections were announced,” said a senior party functionary. The functionary added, “We carried out three simultaneous surveys of voters between January 25 and 27. The results are encouraging. People are responding to CAA. Surveys show that three out of four people are favouring BJP. Currently, we expect to win around 45 seats. We are not going to stop there. Our campaign is going to get more hard line.” Another party functionary said that the upcoming Union budget might prove a game changer as the BJP-led central government might announce sops for taxpayers, which could directly benefit the middle class.

" Yashwant Sinha blames govt for CAA violence in UP, claims; BJP will lose Delhi polls | India News - Times of India","AGRA: Former Union minister Yashwant Sinha, who was stopped by the Aligarh administration from going to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) to address students, on Wednesday, blamed the Centre for the anti-CAA protests and violence which has erupted in parts of the country, especially in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh (UP). He also claimed that the BJP will lose the February 8 Delhi elections. The language being used by the BJP leaders in their campaign for Delhi elections is proof of their impending defeat, Sinha claimed while speaking to the media. “People use derogatory language when they feel frustrated,” he said, adding that the party wants to fight Delhi’s election with a communal agenda. Some BJP leaders have been pulled up by the election commission for making objectionable remarks during their campaign for party candidates in Delhi. Sinha added that such kind of communal atmosphere was not present during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s rule. “Vajpayee ji never tried to divide the communities,” Sinha said. Sinha, who stated that the local administration did not allow him to visit the AMU, also made an appeal to anti-CAA protesters to express dissent in a peaceful way, and not give the government any opportunity to inflict violence. “The Centre was responsible for the violence in UP and Delhi varsities,” he said, adding that there is nationwide “unrest” due to the enactment of CAA and talk about implementation of NRC across the country. “People are mistaken if they think they can rule the country on the basis of lies and violence,” he said, stating that “Nathuram Godse’s ideology will never be accepted by this nation”. On the upcoming Budget, the former finance minister said, “All expectations are dead now. The economy is passing through its worst-ever crisis and its revival looks very unlikely. Demonetisation was absolutely wrong and the way the government implemented GST was wrong too. These two steps are mainly responsible for the current state of the economy.” On Wednesday, Sinha was in Aligarh during a stopover of his march from Mumbai to Delhi’s Rajghat for propagating Mahatma Gandhi’s ideology. He said the 21-day-long journey will conclude in Delhi on Thursday, and the message is to persuade the government to withdraw CAA and not implement NRC.

The governor announced in the assembly that despite deep reservations he was reading out paragraph 18, which contained the reference to the assembly's unanimous resolution against the controversial citizenship act, to honour the chief minister, who had written back to him on Wednesday morning requesting him to maintain constitutional propriety. The controversial paragraph said, ""Our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism, which is part of the basic structure of our Constitution. This august body unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Central Government to abrogate the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, which my Government believes goes against the cardinal principles underlying our Constitution. Pursuant to this, my Government has filed an Original Suit before the Honourable Supreme Court invoking provisions of Article 131 of the Constitution"". The UDF-led opposition, which tried to block the governor from entering the assembly, and later boycotted his address, cried foul. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala told reporters that the state government and the governor had come to a ""truce"". ""The double stand of the chief minister has been exposed now.

Four pro-CAA TV ad films stuck at Kolkata censor office | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Four pro-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) ad films have got stuck at the regional office of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) following directives by lawyers. Directed and produced by Sanghamitra Chaudhuri, the ads were submitted for certification in December. They were screened at CBFC’s Kolkata office last week. But the examination report is still pending. “Certifying ads on any act needs caution,” said a CBFC source. “The same caution is being exercised in this case, too. Hence, legal opinion and constant consultation with the CBFC headquarters is a must. The chairperson is currently out of the country and hence, it will take a while before any call is taken.” TOI got in touch with regional officer Partho Ghosh, but he refused comment. Various Bengali stage and serial actors have acted in the four pro-CAA ads, said Chauduri. “I had made the ads after the act was passed, and applied for CBFC certification so that they could be aired on television,” she said. The first ad, she added, shows a Muslim family, where the mother is asking the daughter whether they have to “return to Bangladesh”. The daughter, in return, says they are residents of this country and CAA would give them Indian citizenship. The second ad shows six people from different religions. “It shows how Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured they get citizenship,” the filmmaker said. CBFC seeks opinion on ad films from advocatesThe third ad shows Hindus who are worried about not having documents, and insists that showing documents is not mandatory for CAA. The fourth shows a conversation between a Hindu and a Muslim person. “The background has anti-CAA protests, where people are burning buses and trains. In this ad, I show that Muslims are also supporting CAA,” Chaudhuri said. TOI came to know that CBFC had invited two city advocates to seek their “expert opinion” on the ads. Advocate Gopal Mandal said he watched the films last week and had accordingly given his suggestions. “The second ad mentions people from six different religions who claim they are Indians after CAA. Legally speaking, CAA gives citizenship to Jains, Parsis, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jews and Hindus from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. But those of these communities from other countries have not been given this citizenship right. So, to use a blanket term based on religious identities is problematic,” Mandal said. Observations have been made regarding the third ad, too. “One dialogues says: ‘Amader naki Bangladeshe pathaibo (We will be sent to Bangladesh)’. But the cinematography act doesn’t allow mention of deportation to Bangladesh in this context. The dialogue could just mention that they might have to leave the country. But mentioning Bangladesh specifically might create problems,” Mandal said, adding that changes were also required for the fourth ad, which talks about anti-CAA violence. “Those who burn trams and buses are offenders. But this offence can’t be reason for taking away their citizenship.” Chaudhuri is yet to be officially informed about these suggestions. “In December, I was told CBFC would not be able to examine the ads before January 5. When they were dilly-dallying a lot, I met the regional officer, who said he needed to speak to the CBFC chairperson to figure out whether such an ad can be done. After permission, it was examined last week. Yet, when I go online I find a ‘pending’ status for the examination report,” she said. This delay in communication, she said, was “disappointing”. “This was the right time to show these ads, since so many anti-CAA protests are on. It is not that CBFC doesn’t want to clear the ad. But I have a feeling that they are scared to clear it here,” she said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Pocket pinch for cab commuters in PCB limits | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: People living in or around Pune cantonment limits will have to pay extra on transportation while traveling in private commercial vehicles like cabs following a 60-100% hike in the Vehicle Entry Tax with effect from Tuesday. “Cab transportation will be costlier as respective service providers will include the increased rates in their fare. Ultimately, people will have to bear the extra cost on transportation,” said Kishor Raskar, a software professional from Magarpatta city in Hadapsar. Traders, shopkeepers and other businessmen will also have to bear the brunt because the vehicle entry tax (VET) for goods carriers has been doubled. “The market situation is currently weak. We shall now have to pay extra money on transportation. It would be a tough situation for many traders and shopkeepers in Pune cantonment areas,” said a member of the Pune Camp Traders’ Association. The upward revision of VET has been in the range of 60-100% for different commercial vehicles. The PCB’s chief executive officer, Amit Kumar, told TOI, “The board had last revised and implemented the VET rates in 2010. Thereafter, it had revised the VET rates in 2013-14, but could not implement it because of administrative reasons. Now, we are implementing the same rates approved in the board meeting in 2013-14.” He said, “The board is entitled to revise the VET every five years. The next revision will be done in 2025, if needed.” The board had floated a tender as per the new rates and completed the statutory procedure. Currently, the board earns about Rs10.5 crore from VET each year. “This amount will increase to Rs15 crore annually. This additional revenue will provide financial relief to the board. It will be utilised for providing better civic facilities to the residents. Complaints related to misbehaviour by staffers at the VET collection booths will not be tolerated,” Kumar said. “We have categorically asked the appointed collection agency to abide by the terms and conditions put forth in the contract. Any complaint related to misbehaviour or excess charge will be treated seriously,” he said. After the implementation of the GST, cantonments across the country had stopped collecting VET. Delegations from many cantonments, including the PCB, had a special meeting with the ministry of defence and Director-General Defence Estates (DGDE) seeking permission to collect VET. On July 25, 2017, the finance ministry issued a notification allowing the cantonments to collect VET. The VET rate hike has not gone down well with activists and army officers. They stressed the board should explore other avenues for revenue generation. “The board has enhanced almost all taxes, but in return residents are not getting necessary civic facilities. The board must explore the revenue generation model and should be able to get its share of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from the government,” said Sanjay Kawde, a resident and activist from Ghorpadi.

"CAA protest: Police detain 10, foil stir at Mohanlalganj | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Police responded swiftly to an alert received on UP112 and foiled an attempt to start another agitation against the new citizenship law near Mohanlalganj railway station in Lucknow district on Wednesday evening. Senior police officials and Mohanlalganj police rushed to the spot and managed to disperse a crowd of approximately 200 people by warning them of action and detained 10 persons. Those detained are Shailendra Gautam, Bablu Ambedkar, Raju Rawat, Sanjay Rawat, Amarjeet, Raghvendra, Jai Prakash, Raj Narayan, Brinda Prasad and Dileep Kumar. They have been detained for violation of section 144 CrPC which forbids assembly of four or more persons at a public place. Locals said that all those detained were workers of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) but senior police officials told TOI that they had not yet investigated or verified their affiliation to any social or political outfit. As a precautionary measure, heavy police force was deployed near the railway station to prohibit any further attempt of starting protest. Earlier, police rushed to the Mohanlalganj railway station on receiving an information on UP112 that as many as 200 people holding placards with anti-CAA slogans, photographs of Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, and and flags of Bhim Army and BSP were going to stage a protest.

Clash over CAA bandh kills two in Murshidabad | Kolkata News - Times of India,"Behrampore: A clash between two groups — both opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act but differing over whether to enforce a protest bandh — claimed two lives in Murshidabad’s Jalangi on Wednesday. One of the dead was the 62-year-old imam of a local mosque, Anarul Islam, who was hit by a bullet while returning home after namaz. The other victim was 17-year-old migrant labourer Sheikh Salauddin, who returned home barely 10 days ago. Both were rushed to Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital but declared dead on arrival. The clash, police said, broke out between bandh enforcers and opponents at Jalangi’s Sahebnagar. Trinamool leaders said they opposed the bandh as it was Saraswati Puja. “We, too, are against the new citizenship law but we do not want people to be inconvenienced,” Murshidabad district Trinamool president Abu Taher Khan said, explaining why the local Trinamool unit opposed the bandh. The bandh call, officials said, was given by the Nabajagaran Mancha (comprising supporters of a host of political parties). Nabajagaran Mancha executive committee member Emdadul Mandal said it was a “pre-announced bandh” and the violence was “instigated to foil it”. Trinamool Jalangi North president Tahiruddin Mandal, however, said the violence was the “work of bandh supporters”. Wednesday’s clash started after bandh opponents reached the Sahebnagar market after getting information that bandh supporters were forcing a shutdown. The rival groups fired and hurled bombs at each other, witnesses said. Both victims were said to have succumbed to bullet wounds. Bandh supporters Mijanur Rahaman and Alauddin Biswas and Trinamool worker Mantu Sheikh were admitted to MMCH with bullet injuries. The Sahebnagar neighbourhood, where the clash occurred, remained tense for some time. Vehicles did not ply along the Sagarpara-Sheikhpara State Highway and Dhanirampur-Bhaduriapara Road after the clash, prompting police to patrol the area. “We are investigating who all were behind the clash. We have detained five persons. A police picket is in the area to prevent further trouble,” deputy inspector-general Mukesh Kumar said. Anarul’s son, Sahabul, said his dad was an imam and avoided politics. “He went to conduct namaz and was returning home after locking the mosque gates. What was his fault?” he asked. Salauddin’s dad said his son was not into politics but had decided to join the bandh call as he felt it was a “non-political platform” to oppose the National Register of Citizens.

"Bihar: JD(U) expels Prashant Kishor, Pavan K Varma for ‘indiscipline’ | Patna News - Times of India","PATNA: JD (U) on Wednesday expelled its national vice-president Prashant Kishor and national general secretary Pavan K Varma for “violating organisational discipline” by making “controversial statements against the party’s official line”. For quite some time, Kishor and Varma had been publicly criticizing JD(U) and its president Nitish Kumar for supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR). Earlier this week, the differences between JD(U) and the two now expelled leaders snowballed into serious personal feud with Nitish, who has been chief minister of Bihar since 2005. Announcing the sacking of Kishor and Varma, JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi, in a statement, said, “Despite being a functionary of the JD(U), Prashant Kishor issued several controversial statements in the last few weeks, which were against the party’s decision and were indicative of his autocratic behaviour.” Tyagi added, “Our national president (Nitish) honoured him (Kishor) after he joined the party, but he used his position to further his individual pursuits. Kishor also used insulting words for the party’s national president. It is imperative that Kishor be removed from the party, so that he doesn’t fall any lower.” Within minutes of his expulsion, Kishor tweeted, “Thank you Nitish Kumar. My best wishes to you to retain the chair of Chief Minister of Bihar. God bless you.” Regarding Varma, Tyagi said, “Nitish Kumar gave more honour to Pavan Varma than he deserved. Making a letter to the party president public and revealing certain private talks in the letter show that party discipline was not a priority for Varma. JD (U) runs on collective responsibility, but some people start believing that the party runs on their ideology.” Varma, in a sarcastic tweet posted about an hour after his sacking from the party, said, “Thank you Nitish Kumar ji for freeing me from my increasingly untenable position of defending you and your policies. I wish you well in your ambition of being CM of Bihar at any cost.” Earlier in the day, JD-U functionary Ajay Alok attacked Kishor calling him “coronavirus”. He said, “He (Kishor) works for AAP, talks to Rahul Gandhi, sits with Mamata didi. Who will trust him? We are happy this ‘coronavirus’ is leaving us…he can go wherever he wants.” He added, “He (Kishor) could not win the trust of either Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Nitish Kumar. He is not a trustworthy person.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"CAA Protest Mumbai: Mumbai cops fear CAA stir, bar pride parade | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: In anticipation of anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests, organisers of the Queer Azaadi March, the annual pride parade that has been an expression of equal rights for LGBT individuals, have been denied police permission to host the event on February 1 at the August Kranti Maidan, where festivities commence every year before culminating at Girgaum Chowpatty. In a letter to the organisers on Wednesday, senior inspector Rajendra Mohite of Gamdevi police station said they had received information that anti-government slogans could be raised and members of the community may come up with placards protesting the CAA and NRC. “This might create a law and order situation resulting in a cognisable offence. If you go ahead with the rally, legal action would be taken against you,” stated the letter that also referred to a prohibitory order from January 23 to February 6, 2020 on restrictions on assembly of more than five persons under Section 37 (3) of the Mumbai Police Act, 1951. “If you carry out a rally on February 1 and if there are losses to government and private properties, you will have to pay for the damages,” the letter stated. Earlier, a few members of Queer Azaadi—a collective of individuals and organizations working for queer causes and equal rights for the queer LGBTQ community and the main organiser of the march— were called in at the Gamdevi police station on Tuesday evening and informed of apprehensions about unrest in the name of an anti-CAA protest. “We told the police that we cannot assure them that there will be no slogans or posters related to CAA or NRC, because it’s an issue that affects the queer and transgender people living in the margins and intersections of caste, religion and region. Although the police were polite with us while declining permissions and are concerned about any untoward incident at this year’s event that may become a deterrent for permissions next year and even tarnish the impression of the community, we expect that the police would make arrangements to ensure that people are safe and can go ahead with the march,” said LGBT rights activist Harish Iyer. A senior police officer told TOI, “We have been allowing it at August Kranti Maidan for all these years without any objections. However, we have information that there could be anti-NRC-CAA protest and that some people were planning to carry placards. Hence we told them that we cannot grant them permission.” He added that the notified area for any kind of protest in the city is Azad Maidan. Although activists organizing the march have failed to convince the police, they are reluctant to shift the parade to Azad Maidan as recommended by the cops, given that the pride march has historically commenced at the Gowalia Tank ever since it was first held on August 16, 2008. “This location was designed as a spot for staging our parade since it lies within highrises and lower lanes and allows us to assert our identity to a larger cross-section of people,” Iyer said. “However, we will meet on Thursday morning and decide on the future course of action.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Will protest if Indian Muslims are troubled by NRC, says Ramdev | Hubballi News - Times of India","Hubballi: Seeking to disabuse people of the notion that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), recently passed by the BJP-led central government threatened the legitimacy of Muslims in the country, yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Wednesday said that he would among the first to take to the streets should the community face any such trouble. “If the National Register of Citizens (NRC) threatens injustice to Indian Muslims, it I not just I, but a billion Indians will protest against its implementation,” he added. Recalling his longstanding association with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Ramdev said, “I have known Modi for more than 15 years, and I can assure you that he cannot be called anti-Muslim. There is nothing in the CAA that threatens the rights of Muslims, some of whom are being misled by a few.” The yoga guru said that, while 99% of the Muslims in India were patriotic, the remaining ones were seeking to divide the country, which he said was resulting in Islam falling into disgrace. “I appeal to all Muslims to keep away from such anti-national forces seeking to bring a bad name to Islam,” said Ramdev, calling on the people to stay united in the face of the severe economic crisis that the country was presently in the grips of. He added that he was as committed to his goal of getting black money back to India. However, when quizzed by journalists as to how long he was willing to wait for PM Modi to realise this objective, Ramdev said, “Chodi, mere aur Modi ke beech jagada mat lao (Please do not incite a fight between Modi and me).” The yoga guru also endorsed the decision of the Centre to recognise singer Adnan Sami with a Padma award.

 Pro-CAA films stuck with censors in Kolkata | India News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Four pro-CAA ad films have got stuck at the regional office of the Censor Board of Film Certification, which has sought “expert opinion” on them from two city lawyers. Though the films, directed and produced by Sanghamitra Chaudhuri, were submitted for certification in December, they were finally screened at CBFC’s Kolkata office only last week. The examination report is still pending. “Certifying ads on any Act needs caution,” said a CBFC source. “The same caution is being exercised in this case, too.” TOI got in touch with regional officer Partho Ghosh, but he refused comment. “I made the ads after Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed and applied for certification,” Chaudhuri said. The first ad, she added, shows a Muslim woman asking her daughter whether they have to “return to Bangladesh”. The daughter replies they are residents of this country and CAA will give them Indian citizenship. The second ad shows six people from different religions. “It shows how PM Modi has ensured they get citizenship,” the filmmaker said. The third ad shows Hindus who are worried about not having documents, and insists that showing documents is not mandatory for CAA. The fourth shows a conversation between a Hindu and a Muslim person.

Non-Muslim areas stay aloof from Bharat Bandh against CAA-NRC | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Nagpur: The Bharat bandh against NRC-CAA called by Bahujan Kranti Manch (BKM), a part of BAMCEF, an Ambedkarite organization, had total impact in pockets like Mominpura, Teka Naka, and Jafar Nagar, with predominant Muslim population. Sporadic incidents, like stone pelting by a group at Pachpaoli bridge, and confrontation with local shopkeepers in Jaripatka, were reported. The bandh otherwise remained peaceful in the city. No offence was registered by the police, neither did they use force against the protesters. Near Pachpaoli bridge, policemen tried to stop the advancing protesters, but were outnumbered by the crowd which went ahead, though, the matter did not escalate further. For a brief period, at around 1:30pm, a groups of protesters marching from Kamptee, blocked the road at the busy Automotive Square. At Jafar Nagar and Gittikhadan, where shopkeepers, including Muslims, had kept establishments open, had to down the shutters after a mob reached there. The march eventually culminated at Samvidhan Chowk. The call was also supported by Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind, a body of clerics which was the key factor for gathering numbers for the agitation. Even as residents in areas like Mominpura and Jafar Nagar were seen voluntarily responding to the bandh, a similar sentiment was not seen in the Dalit pockets, which have also been a key target segment for the anti NRC-CAA brigade. The by-lanes of Mominpura, which remain clogged with people usually, were rather empty on Wednesday. The shops and eateries at Mominpura did not open at all. People walked out of their homes, holding tricolor in hand, to reach Samvidhan Chowk, where thousands had gathered by afternoon. Groups of youths from the same locality also headed out towards other areas in the city, including north Nagpur, insisting that shopkeepers down their shutters. Lately there have been attempts to include other communities like Dalit, Marathas and OBCs into the movement. However, not much presence of other groups could be seen during the protests. As TOI went around areas like Indora, Jaripatka and Pachpaoli, a mixed response could be seen in the localities. Political workers here said locals have still not connected with the cause. There was no call to join the protest by the community leaders too, despite the fact that BKM, which gave the call, is an Ambedkarite organization. “Even if the shopkeepers downed shutters on seeing the protesters, the support was not voluntary,” said a source here. TOI travelled with a group of protesters supporting the bandh. People could be seen downing the shutters only as they came. The protesters requested them with folded hands to support the bandh but there was confrontation with local shopkeepers at Jaripatka too. Meanwhile, at Mominpura, the locals said Muslims will be directly affected by NRC. There are many who don’t have their papers to prove their nationality. “Even I was born at my home and don’t have the papers to prove that I am an Indian citizen,” said Abrar Ahmed, who is in his 60s. President of Jamiat-e-Ulema’s Nagpur unit Hafiz Masood Ahmed said, “It’s unfortunate that despite large-scale protests throughout the country, the government has failed to act. However, we will continue the agitation, till the demands are met.” BAMCEF is mainly an organization of government workers who cannot come out openly, due to which the number of presenters was low. However, they have been supporting the movement from behind, said Rehmatullah Syed of BAMCEF. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Traders keep shutters down for a day to stand by anti-CAA protesters | Kolkata News - Times of India,"Kolkata: Several traders in central Kolkata observed a daylong token strike to protests against Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register for Citizens.

Given the gloomy business atmosphere, it is a big loss for us. But our backs have been pushed against the wall.

Bahujan Kranti Morcha, the forum of the organisations associated with the outfits of backward communities, had called for the nation-wide shutdown. The forum had requested even the traders and banks to observe the bandh on Wednesday. While many traders complied, the banks remained open.

Ex-IAS officer urges people to come out against CAA | Jaipur News - Times of India,"Jaipur: Former bureaucrat and activist Kannan Gopinathan on Wednesday slammed the ‘combination’ and ‘chronology’ of CAA, NPR and NRC stating that their implementation will increase intolerance in the country. “CAA is against the Constitution and NRC is against the poor people of the country. There are millions of illiterate, tribal, poor people of the nation that will face the heat of this decision of Narendra Modi,” said Gopinathan. Gopinathan, who quit IAS last year right after the abrogation of the special status for Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, on Wednesday said that even after the move, there has been no difference in the situation in J&K. “Amit Shah claimed in the Parliament that they will bring NRC and put illegal immigrants in detention camps. How will they determine who is an illegal immigrant – by the documents. First of all, they would need a detention camp as big as the state of Punjab as millions of people in this country will not be able to prove their citizenship through documents. Secondly, government does not have any planning on the people after being sent to the detention camp. They will stay in India after being thrown in the camps,” said Gopinathan. He further criticised the implementation of the National Population Register (NPR) saying it will indirectly implement National Register of Citizens (NRC). Gopinathan said, “Everyone says that this is being done to divert the minds of the people from unemployment and economic slowdown in the country, but no. This is BJP leaders’ core ideology and they have to be pushed back by the movement of the people.” He requested the people of the nation to come forward and fight against the ‘fascist regime in the country.’ “We need to keep in mind what kind of country we want to leave for our future generations. If we won’t fight back, we will lose the ultimate fight for the Constitution,” said Gopinathan. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

A trader couple in Yavatmal opposed the bandh, and threw chilli powder at the youths who tried to force them to shut shop. Thousands of protesters marched on the streets in different cities to oppose the CAA. Incidents of stone-pelting were reported from a few places in Akola, Washim and Yavatmal districts. Police had to resort to lathicharge to bring situation under control. In Yavatmal, Pro-bandh activists were seen moving in the city forcing traders to close their shops. Most of the traders succumbed to the pressure and pulled down their shutters. When a trader Kishor Poddar and his wife refused to shut their shop saying they support the CAA, a group of protesters barged into their shop and tried to ransack it. The shopkeeper couple used chilli powder to thwart the bid to down the shutters. Later, police had to use mild force at two places to disperse protesters who were raising anti-CAA/NRC slogans. Some minor altercation took place when a group opposing the bandh objected to the protesters ‘forcing’ traders to shut their establishments. Police had detained 40 women and over 20 others. Police also reported to cane charge at Marwadi Chowk and Nehru Chowk in the city to disperse unruly protesters. In Akola district, protesters indulged in stone-pelting at Patur and Balapur.

 Kerala governor reads government's speech under protest | India News - Times of India,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after writing to Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan that he would not read the paragraph mentioning the passage of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act in his budget session address to the state assembly, governor Arif Mohammed Khan acceded to the CM’s request on Wednesday. Amid a high-voltage protest and boycott by the opposition Congress-led UDF, Khan presented his policy address and read out the references to the anti-CAA resolution, despite his “deep reservations”. Pinarayi had written to him on Wednesday morning requesting him to maintain constitutional propriety. “I have been corresponding with the CM on the matter for the last few days. I disagree with the government view but I will read to honour his request,” the governor said in his speech, in a surprising turn of events which continued to mark the ‘dramatic’ day. The controversial paragraph said: “Our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism, which is part of the basic structure of our Constitution. This august body unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Centre to abrogate CAA, 2019, which my government believes goes against cardinal principles underlying our Constitution. Pursuant to this, my government has filed an original suit before the honourable Supreme Court invoking provisions of Article 131.” Governor Khan, accompanied by the CM, speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and parliamentary minister A K Balan, had to wait for few minutes inside the well of the House as opposition members blocked the passage. As soon as the governor entered the House, the opposition MLAs shouted “Governor go back!” and blocked the passage and prevented him from entering the dais of the speaker. Even though the speaker requested the MLAs to go back to their seats and allow Khan to deliver his address, the opposition members were unrelenting. Khan then called the watch and wards of the House and asked them to remove the protesting MLAs. Opposition member Ramesh Chennithala told reporters that the state government and the governor had come to a “truce”. “The CM’s double stand has been exposed now. The CM begged the governor to read the policy address. This is a ploy to escape from the Lavlin case which may come up soon,” he alleged. The Supreme Court has been hearing a batch of petitions challenging the Kerala high court’s 2018 order discharging Vijayan and others in an alleged graft case involving an award of contract to a Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of three hydroelectric projects in 1997. In his letter to the governor on Wednesday, the CM, said sources, quoted Article 176 which describes the duty of the governor to the assembly. “I request you to read out the speech approved by the council of ministers in its entirety without addition or deletion.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

""Following a decision by MEPs at the opening of today's Plenary session in Brussels, the vote on the resolution on India's Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 has been postponed to the March session,” said a statement from the European Parliament, as it confirmed that the debate on the motion is to go ahead as scheduled later on Wednesday evening. The reason behind the postponement of the vote is unconfirmed but will come as a boost to the Indian government's efforts against such a motion being voted on by the European Parliament. Responding to the deferment of voting, government sources said that ""friends of India"" prevailed over ""friends of Pakistan"" in the European Parliament. ""We expect that our perspectives on CAA will be understood by all objective and fair-minded EU parliamentarians,"" the sources said, reiterating that the citizenship law is India's internal matter which has been adopted after due processes. The motion takes note of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) statement last month, which described the CAA as ""fundamentally discriminatory in nature"", and also of other UN as well as the European Union (EU) guidelines on human rights as it calls on the Indian government to ""repeal the discriminatory amendments"". The debate on CAA on Wednesday will follow the European Parliament's historic ratification of the Brexit bill, under which the UK is set to formally leave the economic bloc on Friday. ""While the CAA's stated goal of protecting persecuted groups is welcome, an effective national asylum and refugee policy should be just and holistic in nature and apply to all those in need,"" notes the motion, which describes the CAA as ""discriminatory in nature and dangerously divisive"". The Indian government has maintained that the CAA, which was passed by Parliament last month, is an internal matter of the country and stressed that the goal is to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries. It has been extremely critical of the move in Brussels, which the European Commission – the executive arm of the economic bloc – has sought to distance itself from. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday wrote to European Parliament President David Maria Sassoli over the resolutions, saying it is inappropriate for one legislature to pass judgment on another and the practice can be misused by vested interests. ""As members of Inter Parliamentary Union, we should respect sovereign processes of fellow legislatures, especially in democracies,"" Birla said in the letter. The European Parliament motion is critical of any protection being denied to Muslims and that even though India also shares a border with Bhutan, Burma, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the CAA does not bring Sri Lankan Tamils under its purview, who form the largest refugee group in India and who have been resident in the country for over 30 years. ""Amnesty International India has pointed out that the CAA does not bring under its purview other persecuted minorities, including Muslim populations such as the Rohingya in Burma, Ahmadis in Pakistan, Hazaras in Afghanistan and Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh,"" it notes. There is also a reference to the Indian government's ""push"" for a nationwide citizenship verification process, the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which it says ""aims to strip Muslims of their citizenship rights while protecting those of Hindus and other non-Muslims"". The motion combines the separate resolutions tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE), Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE), Renew Europe Group (Renew) and European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) Group, representing around 560 of a total 751 MEPs. A sixth group, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), had withdrawn its resolution and references to the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in some of the resolutions have not found their way into the final motion. Such a move, which has been characterised under the ""Relations with Asian countries"" section by the economic bloc, are used as a basis for engagement of EU member countries with specific nations. If it is passed during a vote, now scheduled in March, it will be formally sent to the Indian government and Parliament as well as to the European Commission chiefs. While EU officials are keen to highlight that the motion reflects individual views of MEPs and does not reflect an EU-wide stance, the impact of the motion is likely to resonate with the EU-India relationship as the motion notes that the Strategic Partnership between the European Union and India is based on the shared values of democracy and respect for human rights.

Skipping any reference either to Prashant-Pawan duo or the controversial CAA, NPR and NRC, the somewhat off colour CM mechanically listed the performance and plans of his govt regarding Bodh Gaya’s development.  In his 35 minutes long speech, the CM also recalled the terrorist attack on Mahabodhi Temple in July’2013 and said that shrine’s security was very high on his priority list.  A frequent visitors to the shrine, Nitish Kumar said that he does not only offer prayers at the shrine but each time he visits the temple, he minutely observes the security arrangements. The CM said that the shrine will be provided overhead link with the nearby JP botanical garden so that the pilgrims can use the garden space for meditation and other spiritual purposes. Earlier, in his welcome address, Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said that all efforts are being made to ensure the shrine security and separate entry and exit points have been developed in view of the shrine’s security requirements. Referring to the development of the shrine, the DM said that besides erection of glass walls, decorative lighting system was in place in the shrine.  CM Nitish Kumar along with his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi and senior officials also reviewed the ongoing development schemes in Bodh Gaya.  The most important ongoing project in Bodh Gaya that came for review by the CM is the construction of a world class convention centre in the heritage town.

Later speaking at the inaugural function, Dy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said that the convention centre construction job will be completed in one and half years time.  According to Arun Kumar Ojha, a hospitality sector expert, a comprehensive plan that included good road, air connectivity, quality hotels and effective law and order machinery was required for any significant rise in foreign tourist footfall. The NH 83 was full of potholes, Dobhi -Patna road four lane stands virtually abandoned and on account of short runway, wide body planes can not land at Gaya airport, thereby causing development bottlenecks, said Ojha.

‘Heinous crime’ charges dropped against 26 arrested anti-CAA protesters | Bareilly News - Times of India,"RAMPUR: Amar Singh, the police officer investigating the case against 34 people who were arrested on December 21, 2019, for protesting against the just ratified Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), on Tuesday produced two separate applications before two courts, in which he pleaded that no offence under charges of murder, attempt to murder and dacoity could be made out against 26 of the jailed protesters.  They had been arrested after violence broke out at Hatikhana square, in which one protester, Faiz Khan, was shot dead. The charges of heinous crimes — murder, attempt to murder and dacoity — were dropped after the courts accepted the investigating officer’s applications. The investigation is still on, with police now trying to track the “real culprits”. On that December afternoon, Kotwali police arrested 24 protesters and sent them to jail under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly), 307 (attempt to murder), 302 (murder), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant), 353 (assault or criminal force) and sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. Section 7 of the CLAA (Criminal Law Amendment Act) was also invoked against the protesters. According to officials, 10 protesters were sent to jail by Ganj Kotwali police station, under charges of rioting, assault on public servants and attempt to murder. Speaking to TOI, Rampur DM Aunjaneya Kumar Singh said, “No innocent shall be booked. The entire investigation is being done on the basis of evidence. We had ordered officials that if evidence of heinous offenses couldn’t be found against those arrested, charges should be dropped so that they can be released by courts,” adding, “Charges of murder, attempt to murder and dacoity have been dropped against 26 of the jailed protesters.” Special prosecution officer Shiv Prakash Pandey said, “The courts of the chief judicial magistrate and additional chief judicial magistrate have allowed the applications filed by IO Amar Singh, in which he had mentioned 26 names and prayed before court to have the charges dropped. The IO informed the court that no clinching evidence could be found against them.” He added, “The remaining sections of IPC, which include rioting, assault on public servant, damage to public property, etc, will remain in force against the offenders.” The SPO also said charges of murder, dacoity and attempt to murder will remain in force against the eight remaining protesters, who are still in jail. Police and administration became active after Muslim clerics gathered at Jama Masjid during Friday prayers and set January 29 as deadline for resolving the cases against those who have been “falsely accused”, stating that if their demands were not met by then, they would decide their next course of action on January 30.

Bengal Governor Dhankhar pained on being denied entry in Calcutta University convocation | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Have I ever done anything in the past six months for which I can be called to be playing a partisan role,"" asked Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday to the media, as the protesters who prevented his entry at Calcutta University’s convocation on Tuesday at Nazrul Mancha had described him as a BJP man. ""I am open to discussion, as a human being."" The Governor who was greatly pained at being prevented at the CU convocation said that this tragedy did not just happen on Tuesday and recalled that he had a similar fate at Jadavpur University convocation where too he was denied entry. ""Ï want to underscore today what doom it augurs for the state in particular, if these forces are allowed to run like these."" ""Why I could not attend the convocation, when Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee was keen to accept the D Litt from me and had requested me. I have great respect for Kolkata Police, but they were not concerned about the Chancellor or Governor who failed to attend the convocation.” The Governor described January 28 as a black day in the history of 163 years of CU, as the Asia’s oldest university got a blot as the Chancellor was not allowed to enter. He said that it was a design that his name did not appear in the invitation card of the CU as Chancellor, -- ""So you can understand it well."" ""Security agencies did not alert me when I left Raj Bhavan. I did not write to the Centre about Tuesday’s incident. But I am in deep pain because what happened is in contrast to Bengal’s culture and many people had called me to mark their protest. This was not a loss for me, but the entire academia is shocked by the turn of the event. The whole world was watching as Nobel laureate Banerjee, was at the convocation to be bestowed D Litt and it was not a spontaneous incident, but a deliberate attempt by ugly forces to disrupt the event. Because of a handful people the state is losing its glory and there is exodus of talented students are taking place."" He refused to name any one for Tuesday’s ruckus ""who held the system hostage."" He hoped that with a mature chief minister in the state will help things will improve. He invited the students for a dialogue with him. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Among the protesters were people from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab. Naim Rabbani (41), a Jaipur-based businessman, said the CAA is discriminatory since it does not include Muslims.

Kerala governor faces Opposition ire; reads anti-CAA reference in policy address | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Amid a high voltage protest and boycott by the opposition Congress-led UDF,   Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan   on Wednesday presented his policy address in the assembly and read out references to anti-CAA resolution passed by the house, despite disagreeing with it. Reading out the the anti-CAA stand of the state government, the governor said, ""Our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism which is part of the basic structure of our constitution."" Referring to the unanimous anti-CAA resolution passed by the assembly, Khan, who has been at loggerheads with the state government for moving the Supreme Court against the law and the resolution against it, said the government believes the Act ""goes against the cardinal principles"" underlying the Constitution. ""Strong states and strong centre are pillars of our federalism. The voices of genuine apprehension of the states need to be considered by the central government in the right spirit keeping broad national interest in mind, particularly when constitutional values are involved and there are widespread anxieties and apprehensions among a large number of our citizenry,"" he said. It's learnt that the governor decided to read out the reference to the state's anti-CAA stance after a letter was sent by Vijayan on Wednesday morning, in which the chief minister had requested Khan to read the policy address ""in its entirety sans any additions or deletions."" ""Since the constitutional function under Art 176 is exercised with the aid and advise of the council of ministers, it is requested that the address approved by the council of ministers be read in its entirety sans any additions or deletions,"" the letter stated. The day also saw an unprecedented protest by the UDF members, who also boycotted the policy address. As the governor was being ushered into the assembly hall by Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, UDF members, blocked Khan, raised ""Go Back"" slogans holding aloft ""Repeal CAA"" and ""Recall governor"" placards and banners. Speaker was seen repeatedly trying to pacify the agitating MLAs but in vain, after which the watch and ward personnel, who stood as a wall protecting the governor, cleared his path to the dais. In his policy address, Khan said though he had his ""reservations and disagreement"" over the subject, he would read the para 18 containing reference to anti-CAA matter, just to ""honour"" the wish of the Chief Minister. When Khan began his policy address, the opposition members trooped out of the assembly hall raising slogans and staged a sit in protest at the gate of the Assembly. ""This august body (Kerala Assembly) unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Central government to abrogate the CAA 2019 which my government believes goes against the cardinal principles underlying our Constitution,"" he said. The government has also filed a petition in the supreme court invoking Art 131 of the constitution, Governor said. As he was leaving the assembly, reporters asked him about the unprecedented protest faced by him, to which the Governor quipped that he had faced worst protests than this. Meanwhile, taken by surprise over the governor's move to read out Anti CAA reference in his address, Leader of Opposition, Ramesh Chennithala, who protested along with his front MLAs, told media that the state government and the Governor had come to a ""truce"". ""The double stand of the chief minister has been exposed now. The CM begged the Governor to read the policy address in full. Why is the CM silent on the Governor who has insulted the people of Kerala? This is a ploy to escape from the Lavlin case which may come up soon,"" Chennithala alleged. The Top Court has been hearings a batch of petitions challenging the Kerala High Court's 2018 order discharging Vijayan, the then State Electricity Minister, and others in an alleged graft case involving an award of contract to a Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of three Hydroelectric projects in 1997. Expressing solidarity with the Governor, BJP's Kerala unit took out a march to the Assembly complex. Attacking the UDF, former BJP President, Kummanam Rajashekharan asked, ""who gave authority to Congress to stop the Governor?.."" ""By blocking the Governor, the UDF has insulted the people of Kerala,"" he said. Khan had made it clear that he was not a ""rubber stamp"" and it was ""improper"" that he was not informed by the government before moving the apex court.

UP BJP to launch second phase of pro-CAA campaign from February 1 | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: UP BJP will launch the second phase of campaign in support of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) from February 1 -- this time with the help of MPs and MLAs carrying a door to door campaign in their respective constituencies. ""We have asked not only the party functionaries but also MPs and MLAs to carry out a campaign in their respective constituencies,"" said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh while speaking to TOI on Wednesday. The second phase of CAA campaign is expected to last till February 10. The first phase of the campaign was launched in December last week which concluded earlier this month. In the second phase, BJP sources said, the party leadership has asked the MPs and MLAs to organise meetings of small groups, besides holding road side meetings. The move is seen as yet another attempt of the BJP to counter the anti-CAA protest which is being organised across the state. The party has also decided to distribute booklets and handbills in the state, especially in Muslim-dominated pockets, to create awareness on the Citizenship Amendment Act. The booklets and handbills, sources said, would essentially dwell on the fact that CAA is only meant to grant citizenship to minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and has nothing to with Muslims citizens of India. Party functionaries would also focus on connecting with the Dalit community to apprise them about the CAA and how it is meant to benefit the persecuted minorities, a majority of whom are from the poor and Dalit community.

Kolkata: MCH grads sign anti-CAA banner after Hippocratic Oath | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Interns of Medical College, Kolkata protested against the CAA, NRC and NPR on Tuesday by signing poster, denouncing the Citizenship Act soon after taking their Hippocratic Oath to uphold medical ethics. Even some parents, teachers and other students joined in to sign the big banner denouncing CAA, NRC and NPR placed right outside the academic building of the college where interns took the oath. One half of the poster had the Preamble to the Constitution written on it. Medical College, Kolkata observed its 186th foundation day on Tuesday. Several students received awards for their performances and interns took the oath. Oath-taking is the final step before interns become doctors. The ethical pledge commits doctors to think deeply about the possible applications of their work and compel them to pursue only those that do no harm to society and upholds the medical ethics. The budding doctors said as citizens of the country and strong believers of its Constitution it was their responsibility to resist fascism and anti-people laws and policies and uphold secularism. “Democracy is under threat,” said Debasish Malakar, one of the interns after putting his signature taking a stand against CAA, NRC and NPR. “Just like we took an oath to uphold the medical ethics and serve the people, this is an undertaking to protect the inclusive nature of India and safeguard the rights and privileges the Constitution grants to all its citizens irrespective of their region, religion and caste. CAA is discriminatory, and we condemn it.” Many students signed the anti-CAA, anti-NRC, anti-NPR banner even before proceeding for the customary photo-op in front of the administrative building in white gowns and stethoscope around their necks. Nobody, however, raised any slogan or waved flags. Students said they did not want to disrupt the foundation day and convocation which was attended by parents too. Students informed they have been peacefully protesting the act since it was passed in the Parliament in December last year. They also protested against the police brutalities on students in Jamia Millia, Aligarh Muslim University and Jawaharlal Nehru University. “We have also invited several intellectuals and members of the civil society to address the students on CAA and NRC. We also brought out a procession on the campus a few days ago. In every programme involving the students we have been protesting against CAA,” said Ritayan Roy, a third-year student. Students said the perception that those studying to become doctors do not care about social issues was not correct. “Doctors are deeply rooted in the society. They do not discriminate against their patients on the basis of their religion or caste,” said a student. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
CAA resolution in EU: European Parliament schedules anti-CAA resolution for discussion: All you need to know | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The European Parliament (EP) is scheduled to hear a resolution against the India's Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which it considers marks a dangerous shift in India's citizenship regime, on Wednesday night around 10:30 pm IST. The voting on the resolution is scheduled for Thursday. Close to 600 lawmakers in the 751-member European Parliament (EP) moved six resolutions against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The six draft resolutions moved by several groups have coalesced into a single joint motion resolution which will be discussed in the EP today. The resolution can go through by a simple majority of those present and voting. Ahead of the resolution, India is ramping up diplomacy in Brussels and Strasbourg to counter the move by hundreds of Member of European Parliament (MEPs).  What is European Parliament?The European Union comprises of seven institutions out of which one is European Parliament. The European Parliament is EU's law-making body. It is directly elected by EU voters every 5 years. The parliament has legislative, supervisory and budgetary roles. The number of MEPs for each country is roughly proportionate to its population. But MEPs are grouped by political affiliation, not by nationality. In total, there are eight political outfits in the EP namely, EPP, S&D, Renew, Greens/EFA, ID, ECR, GUE/NGL and NI. The parliament is represented by the President. What does EP resolution says about CAA?The resolution said that India’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act is “discriminatory”. It said the CAA “does not make reference to the other countries that border India, particularly Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka, excluding minorities such as the Sri Lankan Tamils, who currently form the largest refugee group in India, and the Rohingya from Myanmar, who, according to the UN, are the world’s most persecuted minority”. There were six resolutions and each one of them had reservations about CAA. Even the resolution by European Conservatives and Reformists Group, seen as favourable to India because it recognised that India was free to be the sole determinant of its law on citizenship, called upon India to extend the scope of this law to include others seeking refuge on the basis of persecution due to religion, noting that “migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who are not from persecuted religious groups may also seek citizenship if they so desire”. How does the EP's resolution affect India ?The Strasbourg-based European Parliament is an independent body and one of the seven institutions of the European Union but its resolutions are not legally binding on the European Union and the European Commission. The 73 MEPs from the UK will leave the European Parliament on January 31 when Brexit comes into force. So, in a sense, this is the last opportunity for many of these representatives to target India. For Pakistan, the exercise keeps issues in play, particularly as they are portrayed as a violation of human rights and Islamophobia. However, while these are only draft resolutions, they are likely to leave the government red-faced because they express serious concern over CAA. Even the centre-right, or the group of European People’s Party which accounts for 182 MEPs, said that creating one set of rules for selected persecuted minorities and another, less favourable set of rules for others, “may be considered discriminatory”.  How is India countering the resolution in EP ?The Indian defence centres on the argument that the CAA process is internal to India and is being debated hotly in the public sphere and the courts as in any democratic set-up. There are 60 petitions pending in the SC against the amendment. The government’s view has been that the entire process would be allowed to run the course of popular and judicial scrutiny. For the European Parliament to be passing resolutions on something that is undergoing scrutiny in India would be disingenuous. Gaitri Kumar, India’s envoy to Brussels, met the groups who sponsored the drafts in the past couple of days to explain the Indian perspective. Some of the groups are now more convinced of the Indian argument, it was claimed. The resolutions, sources here believe, have been sponsored by Pakistan via some British Labour and Liberal Democrat MEPs who belong to groups like S&D and Renew Europe, who put up the motions. Following the resolution, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had written to European Parliament President David Maria Sassoli, asserting that it was inappropriate for one legislature to pass judgement on another and the practice can be misused by vested interests.

"Won't mention CAA in his speech, Kerala governor tells CM Pinarayi Vijayan | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In yet another round of confrontation, governor Arif Mohammad Khan is learnt to have conveyed to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan that paragraph 18 of the governor's address, to be delivered in the state assembly on Wednesday at the beginning of the budget session, doesn't have his approval. The paragraph deals with the passage of an assembly resolution against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and describes the stand of the Kerala government that the act is anti-constitutional and discriminatory. Sources in the LDF government confirmed that Raj Bhavan wrote to the chief minister's office on Tuesday evening, rejecting the clarification submitted by CMO on concerns raised by the governor regarding the inclusion of CAA in the draft address prepared by the council of ministers.

Jagdeep Dhankhar: Governor forced to leave Calcutta University convocation programme by anti-CAA protesters | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Anti-CAA protesters followed governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to the Calcutta University convocation at Nazrul Mancha on Tuesday, holding up the ceremony for 45 minutes and forcing him to return without setting foot on the dais. Dhankhar left the venue after a futile hour-long wait, inside the Nazrul Mancha green room, for the protests to subside. Tuesday’s agitation came more than a month after a similar protest during the Jadavpur University convocation, where university staffers forced him to return and graduating students protested against his “pro-CAA stand”. Tuesday’s protesters, who forced Dhankhar to return, said they were students of various CU-affiliated colleges from all over the city. The governor later vented his ire in a tweet: “(The) convocation was at Nazrul Mancha and not on the campus. There was total failure of the state machinery to maintain law and order. The obstruction was stage-managed.” Scene of protest at Nazrul ManchaDhankhar, before leaving the convocation venue on Tuesday, signed the honoris causa scroll for 2019 Economics Nobel Laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee. Banerjee delivered his address after order was restored, where he ignored the chaos that happened before but touched upon the work that had brought him the honour and his past as an undergraduate student of Presidency College (then a CU affiliate): “It is, in many ways, homecoming for me. It is a little bit hard for me to entirely comprehend it.” VC: Situation was not conducive for ceremonyAnother of Tuesday’s honorees, Johns Hopkins University Anthropology professor Veena Das (who received the Sudhindra Chandra Chakraborty Memorial Medal), felt students had the right to protest as there a nationwide stir against the atrocities they were subject to. Some of the doctoral degree recipients and guests, however, felt that the protesters could have spared the convocation. “We have waited for this occasion for years. Why should a section of outsiders, claiming to be students, force the chancellor to leave?” one of them, Debashish Chakraborty, asked. The protesters were in no mood to listen. Cops and the governor’s security somehow managed to make way for his car to reach Nazrul Mancha, where he got off and made his way to the VIP room off-stage, ignoring the black flags and posters pasted with anti-CAA slogans. The protesters then shifted to inside the auditorium, where they went on with their slogans against the new citizenship law. Trinamool Chhatra Parishad member of the CU unit claimed most of the protesters were from affiliated colleges. “We did not have any protest plans at all,” CU MBA student and TMCP member Rony Ghosh said. Vice-chancellor Sonali Chakraborty-Banerjee finally took the stage a little after 1 p.m. and requested the demonstrators to clear the aisle to make way for the convocation procession. But, with no one listening to her, she was finally forced to say that the chancellor would neither accompany the convocation procession nor hand over the D.Litt to the Nobel laureate. But the impasse continued as she could not promise that Dhankar would not preside over the convocation. Chakraborty-Banerjee then returned to the green room to tell Dhankhar about the situation. The VC returned to face the protesters after a few minutes but, by then, the governor had had enough and left the venue. The protesters, too, left soon after they were told that the governor had left. The ceremony finally began around 1.45 p.m.. Chakraborty-Banerjee later said she was forced to tell Dhankhar that a section of students would not let the convocation take place as long as he was there. “I told him that it would not be possible for me to conduct the ceremony in such a situation,” she said.

"Narayan Tripathi: Madhya Pradesh BJP MLA Narayan Tripathi stuns party, says CAA is divisive | Bhopal News - Times of India","BHOPAL: BJP MLA Narayan Tripathi went against the party line and spoke out against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on Tuesday, saying that the country should not be divided in the name of religion and cautioning that Muslims are distancing themselves because of the new law. ""There are issues in the country, like jobs and development, which are to be addressed. Either you believe in the Constitution framed by Baba Saheb Ambedkar or not. If you do not believe in it, just tear it up and throw it. India is a secular country and it should not be divided in the name of religion,"" Tripathi said on Tuesday.  Justifying his decision to oppose CAA, Tripathi said, ""I come from a village and it is not easy for people to even make Aadhaar cards for identification. People have to carry papers to local offices for days. We talk about 'Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam' (the world is one family), but the new Act is dividing the community in villages. Muslims who had been greeting us like brothers have now turned unknown. They are not responding to any of our calls,"" he said. Opposing CAA was his personal opinion and not related to the party, he said. ""I have no issue with the party, except for CAA. I will continue to oppose the law,"" he said. ‘Tripathi has exposed Sangh’s agenda’Congress seized on the BJP MLA’s hard talk on CAA to criticize the saffron party. “Even in BJP, leaders are opposing CAA which is dividing the country in the name of religion. This is a lesson for BJP that the conspiracy against the country will not be successful,” said Congress state spokesperson J P Dhanopia. “Not only common people, conscientious leaders of BJP have begun opposing their party’s divisive policies. BJP MLA Narayan Tripathi has exposed his party’s and the Sangh’s communal agenda. Tripathi has blown the bugle of revolt against divisive forces and has spoken up for unity and integrity of the country,” said PCC media cell chief Shobha Oza. Tripathi’s statement has given a big jolt to BJP, which is midway through a drive to spread awareness on CAA. “Tripathi is with BJP and will remain with the party. BJP’s stand on CAA is clear. If he (Tripathi) has any confusion on the issue, the party will talk to him to resolve the doubts,” said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.

In 2010, she got married to Rajashekaran Krishnamurthy and the marriage was registered at Ranchi. After the wedding, she moved to Bengaluru and obtained PAN, Aadhaar and voter ID cards. On April 1, 2019, Archana applied for a visa to Bangladesh for herself and her son. During her journey on May 20, 2019, they were detained at Kolkata airport and released later.

Narendra Modi:   Those communalising government steps like CAA exposed: PM Narendra Modi | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The real face of some people who are trying to give a communal colour to the government’s decisions to resolve problems that have lingered for decades was being exposed and coming under close scrutiny, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in New Delhi on Tuesday. “The country is silent but fully understands what is happening... how lies to further vote banks have been concocted for decades. People have understood all this,” Modi said while addressing a National Cadet Corps rally. The PM’s comments came in the context of his references to the decision to abrogate Jammu & Kashmir’s special status and passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. PM Modi hit out strongly against those opposed to CAA and said that certain political parties were so obsessed with vote-bank politics that they couldn’t see even rape and kidnappings of girls belonging to minority communities in Pakistan. “The youth of this country has decided that prob-lems will not be deferred, they will be confronted and dealt with,” Modi said in remarks seen as an outreach to his youthful audience in the backdrop of opposition parties and a section of commentators claiming that youth were driving the protests against CAA. Referring to the decisions on J&K, Modi asked how long the ills that accompanied Partition could be allowed to linger and a death toll of victims of terrorism allowed to mount. “Sometimes, when an illness continues for very long, it becomes part of the body. Could we have allowed this situation to continue,” he asked. He also spoke of the decision to regularise some 1,700-odd colonies in Delhi, saying it provided succour to some 40 lakh people. Modi said that CAA was intended to correct a “historic blunder” committed at the time of Partition and cited a recent advertisement by Pakistan army in which it had sought applications for sanitation workers with a rider that only non-Muslims could apply for the job.

The FIR is based on a complaint received by Bidar police station from one Neelesh Rakshyala last Sunday, five days after the performance at Shaheen School. A Facebook video purportedly showing the play and the reactions of the audience, including a girl shouting an allegedly anti-Modi slogan, has been cited as proof of the performance being used to drum up ""anti-national sentiments"".  Shaheen School, part of the Shaheen Group of Institutions and managed by the Allama Iqbal Educational Society, on Tuesday contested the allegations. ""Cops have been visiting the school on a daily basis over the past three days and inquiring about the children and their teachers. They are being treated like anti-nationals,"" said Yusuf Ahamed, director of the school.  According to the complainant, the Class IV kids acting in the play were made to mouth dialogues that were ""anti-national"" in nature.

"Sharjeel, critic of Left politics, one of first anti-CAA protesters | Delhi Election 2020 Election News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Long before several parts of the country erupted in protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December, a lone figure went around several areas in Delhi, pamphlets in hand “raising awareness” against the proposed law. And when women of Shaheen Bagh began a peaceful protest against CAA and National Register of Citizens, Sharjeel Imam was, at times, introduced as the one who was instrumental in mobilising them. Apart from the demonstrators and journalists who frequented the area, the 31-year-old PhD scholar at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) was hardly a recognisable name. But by Monday, police in five states were on the hunt for Imam, his pictures splashed across newspapers, as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Union home minister Amit Shah traded barbs over him. The computer science graduate from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay was charged with sedition after his speech at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) earlier allegedly suggesting “cutting off” Assam and the Northeast from India went viral. Imam was picked up from Jehanabad (Bihar), the district he grew up in, on Tuesday to be flown to New Delhi for questioning. While Imam wrote on Twitter that he had surrendered, Delhi Police maintained that he was arrested. In a letter, his mother, Afshan Rahim, alleged harassment by police and the authorities. She said Imam was being “victimised for a statement that had been twisted and taken out of context by the media”. In the speech made at AMU on January 16, Imam was heard drawing attention to the “plight of Muslims in Assam” who were being sent to detention centres. He also said that to “help Assam” they would have to “block the way” for the Army as well as block supplies. He later clarified to newspapers that he had been calling for a “chakka jam” to draw the government’s attention to the grievances of protesters. On Facebook, several of his posts sought a chakka jam. He maintained that the protests should be non-violent. But even before Imam — who completed part of his schooling at St Xavier’s High School, Patna, and went on to study at Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj — became a strong voice of opposition to CAA, he had written about discrimination against Muslims. A year after the disappearance of JNU student Najeeb Ahmed in 2016, with whom Imam shared his hostel wing, he had written about “prejudices against Muslims” and how his two-year tryst in the corporate world had left him disenchanted. After graduating from IIT-B in 2011, Imam spent two years in a software company in Bengaluru before joining JNU’s Centre for Historical Research in 2013, choosing to do his thesis on late colonial Muslim politics in south Asia. Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, who were charged with sedition in 2016, are also alumni of CHS. At JNU, Imam’s seniors told TOI that he was academically good. “He was initially with the Left, but disassociated himself due to political differences,” said a senior. Another close friend said, “Imam is vocal about his ideas and an open critic of Left politics. He has been a part of various protests at JNU, including the recent one on fee hike.

 EU nation urges India on ‘stateless people’ | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over CAA and NRC, Luxembourg, a European Union member, said on Tuesday that it doesn’t want to “interfere in the domestic policy” of India but has asked New Delhi to “do everything” to not increase stateless people. This was conveyed by visiting Luxembourg foreign minister Jean Asselborn during talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. “What I said to the minister (Jaishankar) this morning is ‘do everything you can do to not increase stateless people’. That is something that we have to fight against. Rest concerns India,” Asselborn said during an interactive session at India International Centre after his meeting with Jaishankar. With six resolutions being moved in the European parliament against CAA, Asselborn said Jaishankar could explain his point of view when he visits Europe in February-March. On a question about the resolutions, Asselborn defended the move, saying that the EP also criticises its members often, and takes up “aggressive” positions against them. “The problem is if you have an addition of migration and religion, it is very difficult to find a solution,” the minister said in reference to the Indian context. In a release, the external affairs ministry said the two counterparts reviewed the excellent bilateral relations and discussed ways to further strengthen the ties.

Mamata: Talks with Centre only after CAA is repealed | Kolkata News - Times of India,"Kolkata: A day after the Be-ngal assembly passed a resolution to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and withdraw NRC and NPR, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Tuesday she was ready to hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, provided CAA is repealed.

But he should first tell political parties and the common people that he will repeal CAA,” Banerjee said at the Gandhi statue, where the CM along with other artists took up the brush to express dissent against CAA, NPR and NRC. “CAA was implemented without consulting the opposition. Even on Kashmir (abrogation of Article 370), the opposition was not consulted. First you implement, then you invite for talks. This cannot happen in a democracy. Talks are the only way in a democratic process, so the PM should first repeal CAA and win the confidence of the country. The PM should assure the people of the country that CAA will be repealed and only then there can be talks,” Banerjee said. “In the name of NPR, wh-at is BJP doing? The issue is burning and the country will be divided. This NPR, NRC and CAA are interrelated and one cannot see these as isolated incidents,” she added. The CM reached the Ga-ndhi statue on Mayo Road around 12.30pm and stayed there for more than an hour. Painters Jogen Chowdhury and Subhaprasanna were also present. Banerjee also criticised the PM on his approach tow-ards minorities of Pakistan. “BJP is glorifying Pakistan. Why should I talk about Pakistan? Let us talk about India first. Pakistan is not my country, so why glorify Pakistan? Sometimes I feel they have become the brand ambassador of Pakistan? I am a proud citizen of this country and am only concerned about my nation,” she said. To a question that the issue was now in the Supreme Court, the CM said: “We are only raising the issue of the common people. India still is a democratic country, which ensures freedom of expression to its citizens. It is the voice of the people.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Complaint against Church body over kids at CAA protest | Goa News - Times of India,"Panaji: An NGO’s child protection coordinator has written to the women and child police station in Panaji, asking that action be taken against a Church body—Council for Social Justice and Peace (CSJP) and another organisation— for including children in the anti-CAA meeting they organised in Margao last Friday. Providing photographs as proof of participation of children at the gathering held at Lohia Maidan in Margao, Emidio Pinho of the NGO ‘Scan’ said that having impressionable children at such events places them in vulnerable situations. The anti-CAA/NRC/NPR meeting was organised by CSJP and National confederation of Human Rights organisations.“Children are exposed to political ideology, aggressive and often derogatory language and this can leave a lasting memory. The impact can be detrimental to their sensitive minds. Also, at such meetings, the participants can become violent and innocent children become victims,” said Pinho in his letter to the police. “We also request you to analyse every speech, and if any derogatory words were used, then provisions of the Goa Children’s Act too need to be attracted,” Pinho said. He said that recently the national commission for protection of child rights had written to director generals of police (DGP) across the country, requesting them to be vigilant to the misuse of children at such meetings. Pinho has also sent his letter to the Goa DGP and the chief minister. As per the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015, any adult or an adult group’s use of children for illegal activities shall be liable for rigourous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to pay a fine of Rs 5 lakh, Pinho states.

The protest march will be led by former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar and Shakeel under the banner of NPR-NRC-CAA Virodhi Sangharsh Morcha. Addressing a presser here on Tuesday, Shakeel said the protest march would conclude at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on February 29. “Many eminent Gandhians will also join the march at Bhitiharwa. It is important that our voices should be heard against the law that will bring no good to the country,” he said and added: “The Centre passed this citizenship law to divert attention from important issues like degradation of education system, rise in unemployment and economic slowdown in the country.” The protest has been named as ‘Save Constitution, Save citizenship Maha-rally, Our country Our Constitution, A Journey From Bapu Dham to Gandhi Maidan’. Many prominent personalities, including social activist Jignesh Mevani, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, ex-Congress MP Priya Dutt, Tushar Gandhi, the great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and actress Swara Bhaskar, will join the march on February 29.

The country will have progress and growth, if the same amount is utilized for development works,” he said. The Congress leader said the citizenship law would not only oppress the Muslims, underprivileged and Scheduled Castes, but also tarnish the country’s secular character and composite culture. “It is a fight of all the democratic Indians to save the Constitution,” Shakeel said.

The paragraph deals with the passage of an assembly resolution against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act and mentions the stand of the Kerala government that the Act is “anti-constitutional and discriminatory”. Sources in the LDF government confirmed that Raj Bhavan wrote to the CMO on Tuesday evening, rejecting the clarification submitted by Pinarayi’s office on concerns raised by the governor regarding the inclusion of the CAA in the draft address prepared by the council of ministers. Stick to approved text: CMO to governor Arif On Monday, in response to a clarification sought on January 25, the CMO informed Raj Bhavan that the draft speech approved by the cabinet should be delivered by the governor “without any change”. Quoting the Supreme Court verdict in the Union of India vs Basavaiah Chaudhary in 1979, the governor said in his letter that he was bound by the advice of the council of ministers to acquaint members of the assembly with the policies and programmes of the government. Neither the SC verdict nor Article 176 (1) of the Constitution says that the governor is bound to express the views of the government on extraneous subjects, the letter pointed out. According to the governor, by including CAA in the address, the council of ministers had tried to mix ‘view’ with ‘policies’ and ‘programmes’ of the government.

Anti-CAA protest near Jamia: AISA member tells court police not conducting fair probe | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A student of a Left wing organisation who was booked in connection with the violence during an anti-citizenship law protest near Jamia Millia Islamia here last month claimed before a Delhi court on Tuesday that the police was not carrying out a ""fair"" investigation in the case. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur was hearing a plea filed by All India Students' Association (AISA) Secretary Chandan Kumar seeking a court-monitored investigation into the case. The court has listed the matter for further hearing on January 31. Advocate Adit S Pujari, appearing for Kumar, claimed the Crime Branch of Delhi Police should also investigate the police personnel of Jamia Nagar police station who had allegedly entered the varsity campus without any permission on December 15 and attacked the students. ""Police cannot enter a library in a university campus and start hitting people. Let the Crime Branch also investigate the police personnel of Jamia Nagar Police Station. The police is not conducting a fair investigation. They are only seeing one side of the coin, not the other,"" the counsel told the court. Pujari added that according to media reports, 102 arrests have been made so far in the case and the police should be directed to show at least one CCTV footage where the arrested can be seen indulging in violence. He further said the police cannot seize the mobile phone of Kumar and it violated his fundamental right. ""The court has to see whether the police can direct an accused (Kumar) to give his pass code for his mobile. It is a violation of his fundamental rights. They have kept the mobile in their possession. All his personal information is there,"" Pujari said. The lawyer claimed that Kumar was not allowed to consult his lawyer when he was called for questioning by the police. ""Let he be allowed to call a lawyer so that the counsel can consult him whenever he is called for questioning in the case by the police. Kumar has always called for peaceful democratic protests. He has always appealed to people to refrain from any communal statement,"" he said. Kumar's plea, filed through advocates Pujari and Kriti Awasthi, sought monitoring of the investigation ""as the investigating agency, while shielding its own policemen who wreaked havoc in the premises of Jamia Millia Islamia University, has proceeded to name the applicant (Kumar), who is a peace-loving citizen/student leader"". It also sought directions to the police to return Kumar's mobile phone. The plea claimed that Kumar had to unlock his mobile phone due to pressure from the members of the investigating agency. ""The continued possession of the mobile phone with the investigating agency is a direct and immediate violation of the right to privacy of the applicant,"" it said. It further alleged that Kumar's lawyer was not allowed to meet him during his interrogation by the police. The plea also sought directions to the police to ensure that a fair investigation be conducted, and appropriate material be made available before any decision to take coercive action is undertaken. On December 15, protests in the area against the amended citizenship Act turned violent. Four DTC buses, 100 private vehicles and 10 police bikes were damaged.

""The uppermost thought in mind while leaving Calcutta University without attending the Convocation is to ensure there is no compromise of the immense respect we have for Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee on whom we are conferring honorary D Litt (honoris causa),"" he tweeted. The governor also showered praises on Abhijit Banerjee and said he was a ""man of sterling qualities and disarming grace... greatly touched by his modest approach and depth"". Last month, Dhankhar had faced similar protests at Jadavpur University, also during the convocation ceremony. The West Bengal government, in December last year, trimmed the governor's powers as the chancellor of universities, notifying a set of new rules governing his interaction with vice chancellors. Under the new rule, the chancellor cannot intervene in the day-to-day affairs of universities, nor can he advise university officials directly. All communication between the chancellor and senior university officials will also have to be routed through the state's higher education department, it mandated.

PM Modi: Govt brought CAA to correct historical injustice | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said his government brought in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to correct ""historical"" injustices and recalled the Nehru-Liaquat pact to assert that the law fulfills India's ""old promise"" to religious minorities in neighbouring countries. Addressing the Annual Prime Minister's National Cadet Corps (NCC) Rally 2020, Modi also said the Jammu and Kashmir problem had persisted since Independence with some families and political parties keeping issues in the region alive. This had resulted in terrorism thriving. He slammed Pakistan and said it lost three wars but continues to wage proxy wars against India. ""The Indian armed forces won't take more than a week-10 days to make Pakistan bite dust,"" the prime minister told the gathering. Attacking opposition parties over their stand on the CAA, the prime minister said India had assured minorities in Pakistan and Afghanistan when it got Independence that they could come to the country if needed. ""This was Gandhiji's wish and also the intention behind the Nehru-Liaquat pact,"" Modi said. The pact signed in 1950 between then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his Pakistan counterpart Liaquat Ali Khan was aimed at allowing refugees to return to dispose of their property, return abducted women and looted property and unrecognise forced conversions. ""It is India's responsibility to give refuge to those people who have been oppressed due to their faith. These people have faced historical injustice... and to stop this and fulfil our old promise, we have brought the CAA,"" Modi said. According to the amended citizenship law, members of the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 and facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. The law leaves out Muslims. ""Our government brought in CAA to give citizenship to such people but some political parties are in competition to do vote bank politics. For whose interest are they working? Why can't they see atrocities faced by these people in Pakistan ""There are many dalits (among those who have been oppressed). These people have been oppressed... ,"" Modi said. Modi said a sanitation job advertisement by Pakistani Army stated it was only open to non-Muslims, implying it was for Dalits. He also referred to the Enemy Property Act and said those opposing this legislation are also against the CAA. After partition, those who left India for Pakistan could still lay claim to their properties. The Enemy Property Act 2016 allows transfer of enemy property from the enemy to other persons. Targeting previous governments, Modi said they treated the proxy war by Pakistan as a law and order problem. ""But even when our armies would ask for action, they would not go ahead,"" he said, slamming the ""inaction"" of previous governments at the Centre. The Prime Minister said not just Jammu and Kashmir but other parts of the country are also peaceful right now and his government had managed to address the aspirations of the northeast region which were neglected for decades. Listing the achievements of the government, the prime minister referred to the Bodo agreement, triple talaq and the abrogation of provisions of Section 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. He also termed ""historic"" the pact signed by the Centre with insurgent group National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) and two other outfits. Modi said his government has taken a series of steps for the northeast region of the country and is holding talks with all stakeholders with an open heart.

"Citizenship Amendment Act: I will be first to go if single Indian Muslim is deported, says Shahnawaz Hussain | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: At a time when several parts of India are witnessing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and the yet-to-be formalised National Register of Citizens (NCR), BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain appeals to the protestors to trust him that not a single Indian Muslim would be driven out of the country. He says there cannot be a better country than India, a better friend than Hindus and a better leader than Modi for Indian Muslims. Excerpts from the interview.Q: Do you think the Modi government committed a mistake by not including Muslims in CAA?A: Not at all. Our leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad had also promised to take care of such persecuted people. India was partitioned on the basis of religion. Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are Islamic nations. But the religious minorities in these countries started getting persecuted in the name of faith. They had thought, based on what (Pakistan’s first prime minister Md Ali) Jinnah had said that Pakistan would remain a secular country. However, Jinnah broke the promise. The minority communities, which constituted 23 per cent of the population, have reduced to just 3 per cent. Some went to Europe and other countries. But the poor, particularly the Dalits and the downtrodden, stayed behind. They came to India when their religious freedom got threatened. Where would they have gone? Earlier also we gave citizenship whenever Indians abroad were harassed. But followers of Islam cannot be persecuted in the name of religion in Islamic countries because their state religion itself is Islam. However, those who were persecuted in the name of religion took refuge in India and we gave them citizenship. In Afghanistan, statues were demolished. Think of what would have happened to human beings. Therefore, this CAA will not take away anyone’s citizenship but will give citizenship. Q: Then why does such an atmosphere pervade against CAA?A: Those who lost to Narendra Modi in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections have been spreading rumours. After 2014 defeat, award wapsi gang, tukde-tukde gang and Urban Naxals got united but still could not trounce Modi in 2019. They thought they could not criticise the government on the banning of instant triple talaq, nullification of Article 370 and the Ayodhya verdict because it was pronounced by the Supreme Court. After CAA was passed, they thought this was an opportunity --- by playing the Muslim card. We do give citizenship to Muslims. Adnan Sami, Salma Agha and 600 other Muslims have been given citizenship by the Modi government. We are not ending the existing parameters and laws for giving citizenship. If we are give citizenship to those who have been persecuted in the name of religion, why are some people having problems? Q: The problem arises because CAA is being seen with NRC (National Register of Citizens). While discussing the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) in both houses of Parliament, home minister Amit Shah reiterated that NRC would be implemented in the country by 2024. Viewed along with what all happened in implementation of NRC in Assam, CAA is being viewed as anti-Muslim.A: NRC in Assam was implemented according to the guidelines of the Supreme Court. But the implementation of NRC on the national scale has not been discussed on any forum of the party. I can say this because I have been working in the BJP since 1986 and am a member of the party’s high-powered decision-making central election committee besides being the national spokesperson. Q: But PM Modi and Amit Shah had spoken about NRC in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Moreover, NRC was mentioned in the 2019 election manifesto as well besides Amit Shah said it with conviction in Parliament. A: We want Bangladeshi infiltrators to be driven out of India. There is no intention on the part of the government to make genuine citizens, whose ancestors were born in India, stand in queue. I appeal to the people not to be misled by anyone. This is your country and you are ours. Dharna and protests are fine. We are not against them. But we are against violence. It is unfounded fear that Muslims would be put in detention centres after NRC. Q: But detention centres do exist.A: Detention centres are built in all countries. If 50 people come to the airport from somewhere without a visa, they will not be sent to jail but to a detention centre. These detention centres are not for Indian citizens. My question is why are Indian citizens, who have passports, whose names exist on the voters’ list, who have driving licence and who have all the documents, afraid of anything? Why are they protesting? Q: They are protesting because there were flaws in the Assam NRC due to which family members of eminent personalities such as former president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed were omitted from the list.A: All such people are being given an opportunity. The point here is that there is a difference between refugees and infiltrators. The refugees come to protect their religion and self-respect but the infiltrators come to earn money. Therefore, the latter should go back to their respective countries. The Congress government had declared that it deported 70,000 Bangladeshi infiltrators. Q: Now this NPR is also coming. What is its significance?A: NPR is a part of the national decadal census. It had been implemented earlier too in 2010 when P Chidambaram was home minister. But there was no objection at that time. Q: However, there are some extra questions in the upcoming NPR.A: No problem. People can give whatever information they can and leave out the rest. Q: CAA protestors have declared that they will not show documents - ‘hum kaagaz nahi dikhaengey’.A: Who is asking anyone to show documents? The government is seeking information to decide and implement different schemes on the basis of the data collected. Q: Do you think whatever is happening in Shaheen Bagh is motivated or genuine?A: Our sisters who are protesting in Shaheen Bagh are from our own country. They are ours and we are theirs. They are free to protest and sit on dharna. It is their right. But they should not obstruct another's path and should not fall victim to any rumour-mongering. What they have been told is wrong. PM Modi said in his speech at Ramlila Maidan that Muslims of this soil whose ancestors belong India should not feel threatened at all by CAA. Amit Shah said in Karnataka and Lucknow, and I have also tweeted, that the country belongs as much to Indian Muslims as to him. No one can either drive them out nor does anyone want to do that. Defence minister Rajnath Singh said no one can even touch the Muslim brethren with a tong. Then what is there for anyone to feel afraid? Don’t feel afraid. Trust your country and your government. Q: If people are being inconvenienced due to the blockade, why does the government not remove the protestors from Shaheen Bagh?A: The Delhi Police has appealed several times and the Delhi Lt Governor (Anil Baijal) has also talked to them. I appeal to them again not to get misled by politicians who want to carry out their agenda. Trust me, not a single Indian Muslim will be driven out of the country. If someone is an Indian Muslim and he has to be deported, Shahnawaz Hussain will be the first person to go. Q: Is BJP benefitting out of the Shaheen Bagh protests and, therefore, not removing the protesters? Does BJP think that commuters who are getting inconvenienced because of the road closures are cursing the protesters and will vote against the parties which are supporting Shaheen Bagh dharna?A: No, we do not do any politics of profit or loss. Q: Ever since the Modi government returned to power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, instant triple talaq was banned, Article 370 was nullified, Ayodhya verdict happened because the new dispensation expedited it, CAA has been implemented and talks of NRC are also taking place. If you view all these in totality, aren’t these anti-Muslim moves?A: Being anti-Muslim is not in our DNA. We are a party which believes in ‘Sarv dharm sambhav’ (all religions are equal), ‘Vasudhaiva kutumbakam’ (the world is one family) and ‘Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’ (together with all, development for all, the trust of all). I am Muslim and I am in BJP. If BJP had been anti-Muslim, I would not have got so much respect in the party. Q: But you were not given a ticket to contest the last Lok Sabha election. Moreover, you were neither sent to the Rajya Sabha nor made a minister at the Centre. Are you not unhappy?A: I am not at all unhappy. That ticket from my constituency in Bhagalpur in 2019 went to our alliance partner JD(U). It is my party’s decision to decide the kind of work it feels fit - whether in the organisation, government, Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. Modi ji, Amit Shah ji, Rajnath ji and the top leadership have always seen me as a party worker and not as Hindu or Muslim. I am not a showpiece, like what happens in the Congress party. I regularly put forth issues of the Muslim community before the central leadership. Q: You are the Muslim face of BJP. In the prevailing atmosphere, how do you defend yourself, BJP and the Modi government in the Muslim community?A: I am BJP’s spokesperson. I am not BJP’s Muslim spokesperson, though I face such questions on a daily basis. Q: The section of the society, including Muslims, which is against the Modi government, BJP, PM Modi, Shah, RSS and CAA are angry with you and Union minorities welfare minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. They write all kinds of abuses for you both on social media. Do you feel you are in the wrong party?A: They consider me as their own and, therefore, they also abuse us. At the moment, they are angry and misled. I do not feel bad about them abusing me. Q: BJP’s Conclave was held at Goa in June 2013 in which senior leader Murli Manohar Joshi had reportedly protested elevation of Modi, who was the then Gujarat chief minister, as the party’s face for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. His reported argument was that Modi was a polarising figure and also that BJP was against the culture of cult personality. Though Modi was appointed as the party’s election campaign committee chairperson and later as PM candidate, do you think that the country is facing an acutely polarising atmosphere?A: There is no polarisation in the country. Out of 130 crore Indians, how many people are sitting at the dharna? People in the Muslim community understand the situation. After partition, Indian Muslims chose to stay with their Hindu brethren. They did not accept partition of the country on the basis of religion. They chose India despite the option of going to Pakistan. BJP does not have an iota of doubt over their patriotism. BJP respects such Muslims. We will visit each and every house and remove the apprehensions of those who are misled. But we will not go to places where sit-ins and protests are taking place because they are staying put without any valid reason. We appeal to them to end their protest and return to their homes as no one will bother them. Q: Don’t you think PM Modi and Amit Shah should hold a press conference to remove the doubts of the people?A: PM Modi has spoken on the issue at least three times. He doesn't talk much about Hindus and Muslims. When he was Gujarat CM, he would say five crore Gujaratis. Now when he is PM, he says 130 crore Indians. But for the first time he named the Muslim community and said that they do not have to fear anything. Amit Shah ji also does not differentiate between Hindus and Muslims. Q: But Amit Shah does talk about Alia, Malia, Jamalia. Doesn’t he?A: No, he does not see that there is Shahnawaz and there is Ravi Shankar Prasad. He sees all of us with the same vision. Whenever I have met Modi ji and Amit Shah ji, I have received their affection and blessings. I did not join BJP when it was in power. I am here since 1986 when we had only two Lok Sabha MPs and now there are 303. Therefore, I am BJP’s tried and tested worker. I have seen all kinds of phases of the party, including the Ayodhya movement. But I did not get disturbed or distracted. One who swims against the tide is the real swimmer. At the moment, Muslims are against BJP. It is also true that there are some people within us who make irrational statements. I do not agree with their statements. I do not agree with those who divide Indians between Hindus and Muslims. Q: Do you think the goodwill of Muslim women which BJP had earned after banning instant triple talaq has been lost due to CAA?A: No goodwill has been lost. For Indian Muslims, there cannot be a better country than India, a better friend than Hindus and a better leader than Modi. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Women continue sit-in protest against CAA in Mumbai on 2nd day | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: It was late night on Monday but a group of housewives and young students squatting on a road in a south Mumbai locality showed no signs of fatigue, as they spiritedly raised slogans opposing the new citizenship law while hailing the Hindu-Muslim unity in the country. At least 100 women, who have been sitting on a side road in Nagpada area since January 26 night against the CAA- NRC-NPR regime, on Tuesday vowed to hold their ground like their Shaheen Bagh counterparts in Delhi. Traffic in the Muslim-dominated area is not much affected, as the protesters are occupying a side road outside a hotel. Most of the women are residents of Madanpura, Jhoola Maidan, Agripada and Mumbai Central areas. Feroza Mithiborwala of 'Hum Bharat Ke Log' told PTI that the women are firm to continue with their protests. ""Women from the Muslim community have been feeling frustrated since the last six years. It is this frustration that women are coming out to protest,"" Mithiborwala said. One of the speakers, Nagma Siddique, told the gathering that the protest was like a 'festival' for them. She criticised the Uttar Pradesh Police and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh had witnessed violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). ""If anyone visits your home asking for your documents, then respond by demanding Rs 15 lakh from them,"" Siddiquie said in an apparent reference to the BJP's pre-2014 poll promise. One of the protesters said the women are balancing their responsibilities at home while also participating in the protest. They go to their respective homes in batches and return to the spot after dropping their children at school and completing other work, she said.

Kerala CM not sincere in fight against CAA: Ramesh Chennithala | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said he would press for the notice issued to move a resolution in the assembly to recall governor Mohammad Arif Khan.

He said the opposition was forced to move a resolution as the government was not ready for it. ""The governor had flouted all democratic values of the position he holds and he made a mockery of the Kerala legislature which we hold in high esteem. But the state government is unmoved despite the harsh criticisms made against the assembly and the resolution passed by its members. As a responsible opposition, we cannot remain a mute spectator when our supreme constitutional body is being targeted by a governor,"" said Chennithala. The governor is continuing his tirade against the assembly and humiliating the resolution passed unanimously by the members, he said. ""The governor is infact ridiculing the people of the state through his statements,"" he added. ""It is unfortunate and strange that the leader of the House was not ready to utter a word despite the governor making harsh criticisms against the assembly. His silence was dubious. It has to be understood that he was not sincere in his words against the CAA. The chief minister has the moral responsibility to register a protest against the comments made by the governor. Since the chief minister was silent, the opposition was forced to come out with a notice in the assembly against the governor,"" he said. Chennithala alleged that the state government and BJP had an unholy nexus and the chief minister's silence signals it. ""This was the reason why the governor showered praise on the chief minister in his Republic Day speech. This has raised several suspicions,"" he said. On Republic Day, the chief minister and other ministers had attended the At Home reception organized by the governor at Raj Bhavan while the opposition boycotted the event as a mark of protest.

Anti-CAA protests: Visva-Bharati bans rallies in campus pockets | Kochi News - Times of India,"SANTINIKETAN: Visva-Bharati has imposed a ban on processions, demonstrations and even assembly of students in pockets on the campus. In a notice issued on Monday, the university declared its central administrative area as ""no-disturb zone"". The move comes in the wake of recent protests on the campus. For the past couple of months, students affiliated to a Left union have been agitating against the vice-chancellor on various issues, including fee hike. Earlier this month, on January 7, students and teachers openly protested against the mob attack in JNU. The following day, students disrupted Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta's lecture on CAA and held him hostage for around six hours.

A section of officials at the university alleged that outsiders had infiltrated into the campus. In the notice issued on Monday, the acting registrar identified the central administrative building, including the central library and academic and research section, as ""no-disturb zone"", where students would not be allowed to carry out any kind of agitation.

 Assam's CAA applicants to get only three months | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 28, 2020)New Delhi: Those applying for citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Act are likely to be asked to swear allegiance to the Constitution and furnish proof of their religion and date of entry into India. These are among rules likely to be framed for CAA. The home ministry, which is finalising the rules in consultation with the law ministry, has said that it has accepted an Assam government proposal to have a 3-month window for receiving applications under CAA and not to keep it open ended. Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal had written to the home ministry earlier this month to have a limited period for applications under CAA and also incorporate Assam-specific provisions in the rules. The law is meant to grant citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi refugees from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who have entered India by December 31, 2014. CAA rules are also expected to make it mandatory for a detailed report from the Intelligence Bureau or Foreigners Regional Registration Office. The home ministry will notify district collectors, deputy commissioners and district magistrates for accepting applications and recommending citizenship to refugees belonging to the six communities. Parliament passed the bill in early December and the home ministry notified provisions would come into force from January 10. According to draft CAA rules, the application form will have a separate column for each country and each religious community which the applicant will be required to declare. Several groups have lodged protests across the nation since the law was passed alleging that it would be misused for denying citizenship to Indian Muslims who may not have documents to prove their roots when a promised nation-wide registry of citizens is made. The PM later clarified that there was no such move for an NRC. Protests have paralysed Assam, where agitators say CAA violates the 1985 Assam Accord which promises detection and deportation of all persons who have arrived from Bangladesh after March 24, 1971. Chief ministers of West Bengal, Punjab, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have said their states would not implement CAA. However, the powers to grant citizenship are vested with the Centre, which would delegate responsibility to district magistrates or collectors in states. CAA also allows the Centre to set conditions, restrictions and the manner for the grant of the certificate of citizenship, officials added.

Two of the victims – Mohammad Shafeeq, whose postmortem was conducted by doctors at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, and Armaan, whose autopsy was conducted by doctors at Firozabad’s district hospital, stated that duo had suffered bullet wounds (entry) of 2.8x1cm and 1x1cm, respectively. While in the case of Mohammad Abrar, no bullet injury was mentioned in the report. It just stated “laceration wound 4x2cm bone deep over the upper vertebral column. Peeling off skin and bad sore present extensively over the back of shoulder, buttocks and both thighs”. Speaking with TOI, Abdul Mutalib (22), younger brother of Abrar, said, “My brother had suffered bullet injury in his spinal cord and was operated at Delhi’s Apollo Hospital after the intervention of Delhi government, but post-mortem report conducted by Firozabad doctors makes no mention of bullet injury. The autopsy report has flaw and I don’t accept it.” When contacted, Firozabad SP Sachindra Patel said, “All the cases are under investigation by specially constituted special investigation team (SIT).” Talking to TOI, SIT head and SP (rural) Rajesh Kumar said, “The autopsy reports claims only five died of gunshot injuries, while two had laceration wounds. Since not a single bullet was recovered from the victims’ bodies, we have asked the forensic team to investigate, as what kind of weapon was used to shoot the victims.” Meanwhile, SP (city) Prabal Pratap Singh said, “I have not seen all the autopsy reports but I knew that six men had suffered bullet injuries, but if SIT has found that only five had suffered bullet injuries, then their finding is more authentic.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Muslim women stage protest against CAA on Republic Day | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: There is no stopping protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Uttar Pradesh. On Republic Day, a group of around 60 Muslim women staged a protest against the Act outside Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s Paliwal Park campus. The protestors claimed that they are not associated with any organization. The women in burkha refused to reveal their identity. They were carrying the tricolor and posters against the CAA, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register for Citizens (NRC). One of the protestors told TOI, “We have gathered to oppose the CAA as it is anti-constitutional and aimed at targeting Muslims. We want the government to immediately roll back the CAA and drop the idea of NPR and NRC. Otherwise, we the women of Agra will go on an indefinite strike like the one taking place in Shaheen Bagh in Delhi.” The protest continued for over 30 minutes. Protesters dispersed after the arrival of police. Ajay Kaushal, station officer, Hariparwat police station, said, “A few women had gathered outside Agra University just to click pictures of protesting against CAA.

" Four months after 'Howdy, Modi!', some Indians abroad protest over citizenship law | India News - Times of India","BENGALURU/MUMBAI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi got a thunderous reception when he addressed a crowd of more than 50,000 Indian-Americans in a stadium in the US city of Houston last September. But four months after the event dubbed ""Howdy Modi!,"" intended to deepen relations with the wealthy Indian-American minority which has influence in India, some members of the diaspora have been protesting against a new citizenship law. In the past month, small demonstrations from Harvard to San Francisco have underlined criticism of what detractors say are Modi's divisive identity politics. The law, which was promised by Modi before he was re-elected and was approved in December, in effect granted Indian citizenship to non-Muslim religious groups fleeing persecution from three neighbouring Muslim-majority countries. Critics say it is a prelude for the marginalisation of Muslims and an affront to India's secular constitution. ""It is still only a minority, but the disenchantment (in the diaspora) is real and deep,"" said a 50-year-old sociologist who gave her name only as Nidhi to avoid straining relations with older relatives who attended Modi's rally in Houston. Nidhi emigrated to the United States when she was five and has taken part in demonstrations against the citizenship law in the US state of Texas. ""If we as Indo-Americans don't raise our voice, we are complicit,"" she said. The latest protests were outside Indian diplomatic missions on Sunday, India's Republic Day. A large proportion of the rallies attract student, academics and religious minorities -- groups that have long been worried by Modi's rise. Many in the diaspora cheered Hindu nationalist Modi to an election victory in 2014, convinced he would transform India into an economic powerhouse. But India's economy has been sputtering because of an ailing banking sector and tepid rural demand, while protests in India, in which at least 25 people have been killed, have revived the specter of social unrest after years of stability under Modi. Microsoft Corp's India-born CEO, Satya Nadella, told Buzzfeed News this month the citizenship law was ""bad."" Even so, a significant chunk of Indians abroad remain die-hard Modi supporters who have staged their own rallies in favour of the law. Social media pushVijay Chauthaiwale, chief of the foreign affairs department of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said overall diaspora support was intact. ""People believe in the conviction of Mr. Modi. Some transient issue will not affect his popularity,"" Chauthaiwale said. The BJP has launched a social media push with the diaspora, circulating testimonies from ""persecuted minorities in Pakistan"" who could benefit from the citizenship law. But Modi's critics say cracks are appearing in his overseas support. ""Those who are educated are saying, 'Hey, this is not what we were expecting,'"" said Sam Pitroda, the opposition Congress party's head of overseas affairs. Chicago-based Pitroda was unable to provide data, but said he was getting many calls from worried Indians abroad. Retired engineer Krishna Vavilala, 82, was excited by Modi's rise and recounted being photographed at ""Howdy, Modi!"" - which took its name from what is a popular greeting in Texas - because his beard made him look like the Indian leader. But recent developments have given him pause. He suggested that Modi, who has not answered questions at a press conference in India since coming to power six years ago, speak to more reporters. Vavilala also urged Modi to clarify ""perceptions"" that he wants to sideline minorities. ""His heart is in the right place,"" said Vavilala.

Kolkata: One Billion Rising to turn spotlight on CAA and NRC | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: A directive, sent to the Loreto nuns about how the One Billion Rising (OBR) movement is being envisaged for this year by the Delhi headquarters, focuses on NRC and CAA. The OBR has been happening for six years in the city and focussing on the issues related to women safety as the movement was started by Eve Ensler in 2012 to fight sexual harassment and rape. The OBR in the city has been planned at Allen Park on January 31. With the word “rising” being spontaneously akin to nationwide protests against the CAA and NRC, the programme of the city OBR will revolve around these issues this year. The Kolkata Mary Ward Social Centre, a Loreto resource and development centre for social change inside Loreto Entally, which organizes the OBR, had already planned a discussion on the issues while the directive from the headquarters has come as a shot in the arm. “The nationwide protests against CAA and NRC will become an integral part of the OBRs everywhere this time. The OBRs across the country have joined hands with networks, organisations, universities, colleges and students who are protesting against the issues,” the directive reads. The event at Allen Park will see the presence of mayor Firhad Hakim, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha and all top cops in the city. “We will discuss inequality challenges faced by people across the country, instead of keeping it limited to the issues pertaining to women,” said Sister Monica Suchiang, the Loreto nun, who is the chief of the Centre. “I am happy that the OBR has a broader perspective this time. India has been celebrated across the globe for its Constitution that promotes equality and justice. Suddenly everything is being challenged and the country has risen as a whole…” said Anglo Indian MLA Shane Calvert, who will be chairing the discussion.

"Mumbai: Teenager, another youth booked for anti-CAA protest | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: An 18-year-old and another anti-CAA protestor were booked on Monday for wrongful assembly and for obstructing a government servant from discharging his duty. They were also booked under the Bombay Police Act. Although the case relates to an incident of stone pelting on Saturday, the two were detained by Deonar police as a preventive step on Monday, when they went to seek permission for an indefinite sit-in protest. The police said both were likely to be let out in a few hours. Sharon Lalzhare, 18, who will appear for his HSC exam, and Baban Thoke, 27, were booked for a protest that turned violent on Saturday. “They pelted stones on policemen and a car was damaged. They had not even taken any permission and were illegally using loudspeakers,” said an officer. On Monday, a group of 10 went to the police station to seek permission for an indefinite sit-in against CAA and NRC at Balasaheb Thackeray Udyan in Govandi. Permission was denied. An officer said the group was asked to hold the protest at Azad Maidan, but they insisted on Govandi. They said women and children were planning to join the protest. The police, therefore, detained four, including Thoke and Lalzhare, as a preventive step. The other two, Irfan Khan and Ahat Qureshi, were given notice under IPC’s section 149 (unlawful assembly) and allowed to leave. Avinash Kumar, a protestor who was part of the group that went to the police station on Monday, said Lalzhare and Thoke were not responsible for pelting stones. “One of the protestors from the crowd had pelted stones at a police van on Saturday, when Lalzhare and Thoke were being taken by the police. It is completely unfair to book them under these charges,” said Kumar. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
CAA:   India ramps up efforts to counter anti-CAA move in European Parliament | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: With the European Parliament due to discuss a resolution sharply critical of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Wednesday, India is ramping up diplomacy in Brussels and Strasbourg to counter the move by hundreds of MEPs. Though European Parliament resolutions don’t affect decisions of the European Council or European Commission, they could impinge on bilateral relations at a time when India and the EU are looking to reset their relationship. PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Brussels in March for the India-EU summit while foreign minister S Jaishankar is expected to visit in mid-February. France bats for India, but troubles far from overThe six draft resolutions moved by several groups have coalesced into a single joint motion resolution and a simple majority of those present and voting is required for it to go through. The movers are also looking to criticise Indian policy in J&K. Resolution totally motivated by Pakistani interests: London MEPEvidently conscious of the potential fallout on bilateral ties, EU spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy Virginie Battu-Henriksson said, “The European Parliament is currently planning to hold a debate on legislation adopted by the government of India last December... It is important to recall these texts are only drafts tabled by various political groups in the European Parliament.” PoK-born MEP part of Europe’s anti-CAA squadShe reiterated that the EU will host its 15th summit with India on March 13 in Brussels with a view to strengthen its strategic partnership. “India is a key partner for EU to address global challenges and to jointly promote rules-based multilateral order... opinions expressed by the European Parliament and its members do not represent the official position of the European Union,” the spokesperson said. Gaitri Kumar, India’s envoy to Brussels, met the groups who sponsored the drafts in the past couple of days to explain the Indian perspective. Some of the groups are now more convinced of the Indian argument, it was claimed. The resolutions, sources here believe, have been sponsored by Pakistan via some British Labour and Liberal Democrat MEPs who belong to groups like S&D and Renew Europe, who put up the motions. The 73 MEPs from the UK will leave European Parliament on January 31 when Brexit comes into force. So, in a sense, this is a last opportunity for many of these representatives to target India. For Pakistan, the exercise keeps issues in play, particularly as they are portrayed as violation of human rights and Islamophobia. The Indian defence centres on the argument that the CAA process is internal to India and is being debated hotly in the public sphere and the courts as in any democratic set-up. There are 60 petitions pending in the SC against the amendment. The government’s view has been that the entire process would be allowed to run the course of popular and judicial scrutiny. For the European Parliament to be passing resolutions on something that is undergoing scrutiny in India would be disingenuous. Government sources said, “The CAA is a matter that is entirely internal to India. Moreover, this legislation has been adopted by due process and through democratic means after a public debate in both Houses of Parliament.” The EU delegation in Delhi told journalists, “The European Parliament is an independent institution, sovereign in the organisation of its work and in its deliberations. The text referred to are draft resolutions by political groups in the EP.” But within the Indian government, certain quarters said the commission and member states should do their bit with their own MEPs given the extensive briefings their diplomats were accorded by India. “As fellow democracies, the European Parliament should not take actions that call into question the rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures in other regions of the world,” a source said. In addition, India said European countries have their conditions for naturalisation dependent on certain criteria. India’s context in the circumstance of Partition and its aftermath was not discrimination, the source said. “Every society that fashions a pathway to naturalisation contemplates both a context and criteria. This is not discrimination. In fact, European societies have followed the same approach,” the source added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
No Indian Muslim will be affected by CAA: Defence minister Rajnath Singh | Mangaluru News - Times of India,"MANGALU RU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh asserted that not a single Muslim in India will be thrown out of the country due to the proposed National Register of Citizens and said the Bharatiya Janata Party will throw its might behind the community if a single member feels persecuted by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. This is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s motto of Sab ka saath, sab ka Vikas aur sab ka vishwas, Rajnath added at a pro-CAA rally here on Monday. Assailing Congress for spreading fear among Muslims regarding a law that both houses of Parliament debated and passed, Rajnath addressed the mammoth rally organised by the district unit of BJP. He said BJP has merely fulfilled a wish that Mahatma Gandh had directed the Congress to do post-Independence. This was also in the resolution adopted by the Congress Working Committee on November 25, 1947, he said. Asking the crowd if the government discriminated based on religion in implementing its various programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, Ayushman Bharat or in providing infrastructure works, Rajnath wondered how the same government could discriminate with CAA. “How can the opposition accuse us of being discriminatory with this step their leaders wanted?” he asked. Reminding the Congress that it implemented the NRC based on a Supreme Court directive, he said, “NRC naam ki chidiya hum (BJP) logon ne nahin laya tha!” CAA is a balm the government is using to apply on souls of persecuted minorities from India’s theocratically ruled neighbours and is not to hurt any Indian citizen, he said, adding that Congress can’t see anything good the government does. Noting that there is a concerted attempt on part of the Congress to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims using CAA, Rajnath said it wouldn’t be surprising if foreign powers are behind it. The former BJP national chief exhorted the party’s rank and file to explain to Muslims that their citizenship is not under threat and they will continue to enjoy their rights as any other citizen. Rajnath said the opposition should not forget the ‘national dharma’. Let the opposition question the continuing persecution of minorities in neighbouring Pakistan, he said. While CAA is only to accommodate persecuted minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, majority of whom are Dalits, why should anyone have any objection to it? he asked. Noting that as home minister in the Modi government’s first innings, he had given citizenship to over 600 Muslims including Pakistani singer Adnan Sami, Rajnath said Muslims from theocratic neighbours wanting to become Indian citizens are still able to do so under CAA provisions. Even with NPR that Congress introduced in 2010, no one will be forced to give their personal details such as their father’s name or date of birth, he said.

Ashok Gehlot's exclusive interview with TOI | Jaipur News - Times of India,"On January 25, Rajasthan became the third state in the country to pass a resolution in its assembly against the implementation of the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens. It also became the first state in the country to officially declare its non-cooperation towards the impending National Population Register.Hours after the historic special session of the assembly, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot spoke to Swati Mathur about why the CAA-NRC-NPR combine is dangerous, how focus must shift to the state of economy and creating jobs, and the reason he believes Rahul Gandhi can lead the Congress in raising issues that matter:Congress seems to be shifting focus from CAA-NRC-NPR to the issues of economy and unemployment. Why?Congress’s stand on CAA is the same that it was earlier. BJP said it will approach three crore people through door-to-door campaigns to explain the CAA. Why has the need arisen? Until today, no laws made by Parliament needed to be explained. It proves there is a major flaw in the law and now that people have seen through it, they are worried and are having to explain. The real issues — the ones that matter to the people — are related to economy. If the government does not take immediate remedial action, the downward spiral can trigger a massive crisis. Joblessness is on the rise. Youth is frustrated and is getting pushed to the brink. Industry is stressed and small and medium trades are shutting shop. Where will the jobs come from? For an economy to grow, there needs to be investment in public and private sectors, there should be purchasing power in the hands of the common people and exports should rise. This, not CAA, should be the government’s top priority. Instead, since BJP came to power in 2014, they have taken decisions to hurt the economy. Auto sector is closing showrooms, petrol, diesel prices are not reducing, prices are rising and farmers, labourers and youth are all frustrated. The GST regime even cost Rajasthan a revenue loss of over Rs 11,000 crore. After winning in 2019, the BJP has returned with inflated egos. It doesn’t care about public sentiment. The government abrogated Article 370 and settled the Ram Mandir issue. People welcomed that because it brought closure to a long-standing dispute. But they are continuing to rake up one thing after another to fulfil their Hindu Rashtra agenda. It is a dangerous game. I even wonder whether all of BJP stands with them (PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah) on this. Because they don’t involve people in making decisions. What is today’s Yuva Aakrosh Rally seeking to achieve?It is a campaign Rahul Gandhi is starting from Rajasthan, where we will tell the youth that we stand with them, shoulder to shoulder. In democracy, it is very important to hear the Opposition’s view. It gives confidence to people. The youth has little faith left in the government of the day. If they feel that the opposition is also not standing with them, they will feel even more frustrated. In public interest, and to tell the youth that we stand with them to pressurise the government into listening to the voice of the people, Rahul ji will lead this rally. We will force the government to listen and to concede. heeded the call of the Congress Working Committee — the highest decision making body of the party — and the sentiments of its members to lead us strongly on various issues. He is an assertive leader and does issue-based politics. He is not waylaid by the government’s efforts to sentimentalise issues. I am glad he chose Rajasthan to start this campaign from. Congress leaders have said states are bound by the Constitution to implement laws passed by Parliament. In this light, since Rajasthan is now the third state to pass a resolution against CAA and NRC, and the first to formally announce its non-cooperation towards NPR, how will you do this?If there is a democratically elected NDA government at the Centre, there are elected governments in states too. A majority of states are saying CAANRC should not be implemented because it is impractical. Take Assam for instance. People went into depression, some committed suicide, many spent hard earned money to bribe officials so their names would be included in NRC. Despite this, they are facing disenfranchisement. The entire exercise cost Rs 1,600 crore and now (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah says it will be implemented across the country. According to estimates, a nationwide NRC will cost Rs 64,000 crore. Can the country afford this? What will happen if it is conducted? Results will be the same as they were in Assam. Of the 19 lakh people left out in Assam, 16 lakh turned out to be Hindus. Yet, they (BJP) created such a ruckus. To prevent a recurrence of Assam, all states have given a call to the Centre not to implement the law. Public doesn’t want it and the majority of elected state government don’t want it. They (NDA government) should accept the public sentiment and withdraw the law. Such a decision will be welcomed by the people. CAA, NRC and NPR must not be seen in isolation but as a package. The entire exercise is not practical. If people decide not to show their papers, how many will the government act against? Assam was a small state and they could extract information through fear and force. But can this be done across India? The problem began after the government said it wanted to conduct a nationwide NRC. Now they are on the defensive and have swung into damage-control mode. The PM said that no Hindu or Muslim will face problems. He even said there is no discussion on NRC in the government, and accused the Opposition of inciting people. On the other hand, Shah said it will be done. Between the PM and the HM, who should the public believe? Both have spoken publicly. The PM should explain this. Ultimately, they should remove confusion, win people’s trust and then decide the course of action. If their decision is in public interest, everyone in the country will support them. Protests over CAA-NRC-NPR have taken a violent turn in several states. Rajasthan saw protests too but they were peaceful. What did you do to achieve that?That depends on the call you give to people. Our call to the public in Rajasthan was for a Peace March. We asked for two things; that the Indian Flag must not be allowed to be defaced and that there should be no violence. Lakhs of people participated and held placards as a mark of protest. If Yogi Adityanath had given the same call for a Peace March in UP, told people there should be no violence and had engaged with them and assured them it was their right to stage sit-ins and protest and that the police would facilitate their peaceful protests, there would be no problem. Instead, he used the language of “badla (revenge)” and told protestors they will be taught a lesson. He ended up inciting people further. In democracy, it depends on the chief ministers and the prime minister as to what call they give to their people. The administrative machinery and the police speaks the language that the CM speaks. The administration understands the intent of the political leadership and acts accordingly. That is what happened in UP. Opposition parties have come together to protest against CAA-NRCNPR. BSP, though, has kept away from Congress-led protests ostensibly because Mayawati is upset over her MLAs being poached in Rajasthan. Your comments. I have not poached MLAs. Their entire party merged with the Congress. The Constitution makes it legal for three-fourth or more of a party’s members to merge with another party. Under that law, they merged with Congress. What can I do? This has happened earlier too. She may have other reasons that she is not voicing. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is active on the ground in UP. That may be upsetting Mayawati ji. There are talks of differences in the government — between you and deputy CM Sachin Pilot. Is this true?The media plays this up. I don’t pay attention to it. I don’t pay attention to these “differences”. We were together just yesterday. We meet and talk affectionately and we do our work. Differences exist when both sides create an issue or initiate a confrontation. I don’t create issues. So where is the fight? It takes two to fight.

 PoK-born MEP part of Europe’s anti-CAA squad | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Mirpur-born Shaffaq Mohammed, a member of UK’s Liberal Democrats, was among the MEPs who moved an anti-CAA resolution for their Renew Europe Group which is the third largest bloc in the European parliament with 108 MEPs. Mirpur is a town in Pakistanoccupied Kashmir. Shaffaq has repeatedly said Kashmiris must have their right to self-determination and appealed to the EU, after India revoked J&K’s special status, to “secure the rights of the Kashmiri people and play its role for security and stability of the region’’. France bats for India, but troubles far from overShaffaq was quoted as having said on Monday that not just Renew Europe but other political groups were also deeply concerned about the violence in many cities in India, the loss of lives and injuries and added that Europe’s parliament “wanted to send a clear message” to India about the “discriminatory” Act. Resolution totally motivated by Pakistani interests: London MEPHowever, Shaffaq doesn’t seem to have unlimited influence with his group as evident from the fact that it’s not Renew Europe which links CAA with India’s actions in Kashmir in its resolution. It’s the Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left which calls for EU and its members to promote implementation of UNSC resolutions on Kashmir. Many in India will see this as speaking Pakistan’s language on the Kashmir issue. Also, far more damaging than Renew Group’s resolution was the one by Greens/European Free Alliance which strongly criticised the private visit of a group of MEPs to J&K and its use “to legitimise PM Modi’s nationalist agenda”.

 Resolution totally motivated by Pakistani interests: London MEP | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: As the European parliament prepared to debate and vote on a resolution tabled by some of its members against CAA, London’s Liberal Democrat representative Dinesh Dhamija on Monday took up cudgels for CAA and called the resolution totally motivated by Pakistani interests. He claimed that not all members were consulted while drafting the motion and that some suggestions for amendments to the motion were rejected by fellow Liberal Democrat MP Shaffaq Mohammed. France bats for India, but troubles far from over“The call for censure has been led by a small group of British members, unfortunately from my own party, in an attempt to create a rift between the two blocs. I say unfortunately because I was not invited to the drafting of the motion as president of the Indian delegation. When I put down amendments to the motion, my pertinent suggestions were rejected,” Dhamija told TOI. According to him, the draft puts the burden on India rather than asking for sanctions on Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh for creating an atmosphere and pushing persecuted minorities to become refugees.

PoK-born MEP part of Europe’s anti-CAA squadThe Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the second largest group with 154 MEPs, denounced that India had incorporated religious criteria into its naturalisation and refugee policies. There were six resolutions and each one of them had reservations about CAA.

Official sources here said India remained in touch with relevant authorities in Brussels and other European capitals. “Not all of these resolutions will come up for debate or vote.

" ED traces ‘suspicious’ flow in PFI accounts, claims it’s funding anti-CAA agitation | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate is probing a series of financial transactions involving Popular Front of India (PFI) as part of a widening probe into the alleged role of the controversial Islamist outfit in fanning anti-CAA protests. A preliminary probe done by the anti-money laundering agency has established a suspicious pattern of deposits into and withdrawal of money from PFI’s accounts. The ED has claimed that Rs 1.04 crore was deposited in 10 accounts of PFI and five belonging to another entity, Rehab India Foundation, between December 4 last year and January 6 when protests against the change in the citizenship law were most intense in UP and elsewhere. The period saw Rs 1.34 crore being withdrawn from the accounts in multiple small transactions: ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000, between December 4 and January 6. ED sources said the transactions were deliberately kept small to dodge suspicion, with PFI’s bank accounts witnessing as many as 80-90 withdrawals in small amounts on a single day. The CAA dimension is part of a larger focus that extends to the source of Rs 120 crore credited into PFI’s bank accounts. The money was deposited in small instalments through ATMs and mobile wallets in what the ED suspects to be an effort to conceal the identity of the depositors. The money deposited was immediately taken out, again in small amounts, leaving a very nominal balance in the accounts. A scrutiny of transactions from PFI’s account in Syndicate Bank’s Nehru Place branch in New Delhi showed multiple cash deposits totalling Rs 41.5 crore from 27 accounts in the districts of Hapur, Shamli, Dasna and Bijnor in western UP, as well as Bahraich. The PFI denied the allegations with its general secretary M Muhammed Ali Jinnah saying the claims were absurd and a face-saving act by the Uttar Pradesh police. These details are part of a report the ED submitted to the home ministry on Sunday evening. The ministry is seized of a recommendation by the UP government to declare the PFI unlawful in the light of its alleged role in inciting violence in the state during the anti-CAA agitation. The ED’s preliminary report will serve to reinforce UP’s demand to declare the PFI unlawful. “Withdrawal of money from the bank accounts of PFI and its related entities has direct correlation with a violent demonstration against the CAA. The transaction dates in the 15 bank accounts of the PFI also match the dates of violence. This draws a clear connection between the violent protests and PFI,” the ED said in its report to the MHA. The report also mentioned a payment of Rs 1.17 crore made by PFI to Jothi group, a plastic making firm. “Since PFI and the company are working in two different areas, the nature and reason for this transaction is under investigation. A transaction of Rs 20 lakh between Rehab India Foundation and another firm is also under the scanner,” it added. The report also mentioned a payment of Rs 3.1 lakh to a terror accused named Abdul Samad who was arrested two weeks ago by Delhi Police’s special cell. Investigation by the special cell, sources claimed, found that Samad was associated with PFI and was inspired by the Islamic State’s objective of establishing a global Caliphate. The UP government’s allegations, along with the ED’s preliminary findings into “dubious” sources of PFI’s funds, mark yet another evidence of the growing reach of the hardcore Islamist outfit outside south India where it was confined until a few years ago. Of those arrested by UP police for violence against the new citizenship law, 25 allegedly belong to PFI. The PFI has been under the scanner of intelligence agencies and the National Investigation Agency for three years now. The outfit was formed in 2006 as a successor to the fundamentalist outfit National Democratic Front (NDF) which was banned for its alleged involvement in acts of terror. The agencies have informed the government and police forces that the federation was an offshoot of Students Islamic Movement of India, another outlawed Islamist outfit which agencies have accused of being the feeder for recruits to terrorist groups like Indian Mujahideen.

CAA Protest Delhi: Police stop a Shaheen Bagh-like protest near Nizamuddin Basti in Delhi | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: An attempt to start a Shaheen Bagh-like sit-in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act was foiled on Lodhi Road late on Sunday when police forcefully evicted protesters gathering on a stretch near Nizamuddin Basti and cordoned off the area through the night. The protesters, however, were camping on the footpath in front of Musafirkhana Park till Monday evening. Efforts are being made to shift them into the park to avoid congestion during peak hours. The cops are also not allowing any more people to enter the protest site. The stretch connects Mathura Road to the Barapullah flyover, which has been handling an increased volume of traffic due to the Kalindi Kunj road closure since the beginning of the protests at Shaheen Bagh. Any chaos on this stretch will choke the whole artery connecting central Delhi to south-east Delhi, a police officer said. “With the Kalindi Kunj stretch already blocked, a choke point near Nizamuddin will add to the commuters’ woes during the peak hours,” he added. Around 9pm on Sunday, locals started gathering at the traffic island under the Lodhi Road flyover, and a group of women even set up plastic tents. As the cops, who were already expecting a gathering, tried to convince them to move to the nearby park, the protesters got agitated. With messages about the “possible police brutalities” getting circulated on WhatsApp, more people turned up and the cops finally forced some of them to shift to the park and cordoned off the area. A video of the incident also went viral on social media. It showed some protesters trying to confront police when they were being shifted from the site. The altercation went on till late in the night after which the protesters agreed to restrict the sit-in to the footpath with 50-60 people. However, a crowd from the locality soon reached the spot, swelling the numbers. “We’ve managed to contain the protesters, and are trying to shift them to the park. We’ve assured them that adequate security will be given,” said a cop. As a precautionary measure, the cops are scanning vehicles carrying groups of people going towards Nizamuddin. The traffic, too, is being diverted through the Lodhi flyover or Mathura Road to avoid congestion. A large number of personnel has also been deployed to avoid any untoward incident near a temple behind Nizamuddin Basti. Meanwhile, the special investigation team has been asked to probe the background of a group of women who has allegedly been spotted at different protests as DU, Jamia or JNU students. The probe has been ordered after a woman leading a group has allegedly been captured on a video misbehaving with police. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Didi: How can BJP decide who eats ‘chire’? | Kolkata News - Times of India,"Kolkata: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday lashed out at BJP’s “food diktat”, saying it cannot dictate people on their food habits. “How can BJP decide who will eat chire or poha (flattened rice)? Do you sustain on air? Can you judge people who eat chire?” she asked. The CM’s comment came after BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya last week expressed concerns over his security, saying that he suspected Bangladeshis to be among labourers who constructed a room at his house. Vijayvargiya, who is in charge of BJP affairs in Bengal, made the remark while addressing a seminar in Indore in support of CAA. He said he grew suspicious about the construction workers because of their “strange eating habits”. “They were only eating poha, and their language was incomprehensible,” he said. “They say one can be recognised even from dress. Are they showcasing themselves as fashion icons?” Banerjee said at a workshop of Trinamool students and youths at Netaji Indoor stadium. She said Bengal skipped the NPR meeting in Delhi on January 17, but other states did not boycott it. “It is a ploy to isolate Mamata Banerjee. If we had attended, we would have given a note of dissent but they would not have accepted it. Thus, we would have been part of the process.” Banerjee said the movement against CAA, NRC and NPR would intensify after Saraswati Puja. She said TMC trade unions would continue the stir at the dharna mancha at Esplanade from January 28 to 30, and students would continue it from January 31. ‘From February 1, there will be agitations at the block level and on February 5, human chains will be formed. On February 6 and 7, there will be silent processions with posters. From February 10 to 13, students will go on a door-to-door campaign so that BJP cannot mislead people.” Urging students to work selflessly, she asked them to continue with the movement in a disciplined way. The CM mentioned that Trinamool was the first to start the agitation against CAA, NPR and NRC, and she was the first to be vocal against the demonetisation process too. “Our party protested against CAA in the joint parliamentary committee and our stand is correct,” she said. Banerjee said that NPR norms needed to be repealed or amended. “There are many people like me who cannot give the date of birth of their father, though I can provide the birthplace of my father. They are saying it is not mandatory to give the date of birth of your father, but if you fail, your name will no longer be there,” she said. The CM said she had received complaints about some NGOs funded by BJP regarding collection of Aadhaar cards of residents. “How can BJP ask people to submit Aadhaar cards at its party offices? We are not bonded labourers, we are citizens of the country,” the CM said, adding that “BJP was continuing with congratulatory rallies, but it will soon turn out to be its immersion rally”.

More app-based cabs at Chennai airport likely from next month | Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Passengers landing at Chennai airport may have multiple cab operators to choose from starting next month. Now, only one app-based cab service is allowed to pick up passengers from arrival terminals. Airports Authority of India is looking to bring in more cab services to offer pick-up from the airport as there have been many complaints from passengers who said that they were forced to book vehicles from only one app if they wanted to get picked up from arrival terminals. A majority of the passengers prefer to board cabs from the lane in front of the terminal and do not want to go the parking lot to board other cabs. A meeting was held in New Delhi with representatives of cab operators to work out a way to have more operators run their service from the airport. For now, Ola is the only operator. “We are trying to give contracts to multiple operators. The existing contract system allows for one prime operator and two secondary operators. But the two other operators who had counters inside the terminals have withdrawn,” said a senior AAI official. He said the meeting was to “understand what changes will be needed in the contract procedure to ensure that there would be more than one cab service at the airport. The current procedure is not friendly to all.” Since Ola was paying a high licence fee, its cabs are allowed to pick up passengers from the terminals. Other cabs are allowed only to pick up from parking lots or pick-up points farther from the terminals. This led to chaos and entry points were barricaded and men were posted to prevent cabs of other companies from entering the pick-up lane along the terminals. An official said the system invited too much criticism because passengers were not getting cabs on time. “The wait time at the arrival terminal gate for cabs extends to more than 20 minutes during peak hours at night. International passengers with three to four heavy bags suffer the most. This is because the cab aggregator does not have enough vehicles and passengers cannot book any other cab. The cab service that can be booked from inside the terminal is expensive,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
CAA is extremely misunderstood: Journalist | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Nagpur: “The Muslim community in India needs to be told that the CAA is not against them,” said Dr Uday Nirgudkar, journalist on Saturday at Dr Hedgewar Blood Bank’s Hall, Dharampeth. He was speaking on the topic ‘CAA and NRC’. Former MP Hansraj Ahir presided over the function.He said, “It is our responsibility to tell at least one person from the community that CAA is not against them and that it is extremely misunderstood. There is a big potential in bringing harmony in religions. It cannot be left in the hands of religious fanatics and clerics.”Nirgudkar informed the audience about the history which led to the enactment of CAA. “Over a period of time, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan were declared Islamic states. In case of Afghanistan, their law clearly states that all religious practices should be as per Sunni laws. So much so, the Shiya sect of Muslims are not welcome there.”He further spoke about the religious persecution faced by many non-Muslim communities in these countries. “Jinnah had promised equal rights for Hindus in Pakistan. In the end, nothing was done about it. If a Muslim accused a non-Muslim of insulting the Quran (normally the burden of giving proof lies on the accuser), but in those places the non-Muslim has to prove his innocence. It’s totally bizarre.”He also told the audience about a law, according to which if a Muslim kills a non-Muslim and that non-Muslim has died during conversion, he cannot be held liable for any crime. Nirgudkar gave many such examples of religious persecution.“There has been a significant drop in the percentage of Hindu population in Pakistan and Bangladesh. So, they are either killed, converted or have migrated to India and are living without respect, identity or even any documents. This has been happening since 1971,” he said.“Pakistani Constitution discriminates by law, the Indian constitution does not discriminate and even provides remedies in cases of discrimination. It is 100% false idea that Indian-born Muslims will be thrown out of the country.”Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
‘CAA not against Muslims in India’ | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Nagpur: Minorities from the Islamic countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan have migrated to India due to persecution. Since they do not have citizenship of India, they are unable to avail several facilities. Thus, Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) has been introduced to grant them citizenship but false rumours are being spread that the Muslim community are under the threat of being driven out of the country, said Captain (retd) Smita Gaikwad of Indian Army, on Saturday.She was delivering the keynote address on ‘Understanding CAA and working of Maoist front organizations’. The lecture was organized by Yuva Aayam at Kalpataru Sabhagruh, Gorewada Road.Unravelling facts about CAA, Gaikwad said, “Every country has different rules for citizenship. India came up with a set of such rules in 1955 with the Citizenship Act that grants citizenship by birth, descent, registration and naturalization. Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan can be granted citizenship if they have stayed for more than 11 years in India, by naturalization. Even today, that clause remains the same.”She added, “There have been countrywide protests opposing CAA. Not only Maoists but people from the Muslim community, several NGOs and certain celebrities among others have joined the protests. This is a result of the lies and rumours that are being spread against the Act. Many of the people participating in protests have not even understood the concept of CAA. Maoist organizations take advantage of such situations and try to incite violence.”Addressing the backlash against CAA, she said, “People have labelled the Act as unconstitutional. In India, there are some laws that are applicable to women and not men. This is because they were framed for protection of women after considering the social experience. Laws against caste atrocities were formed to counter discrimination. A law cannot be tagged unconstitutional for protecting minorities.”“Even if the Act is unconstitutional, the democratic way to handle it is to approach the Supreme Court. There are a number of petitions filed and people are still taking to the streets and giving way to violence,” said Gaikwad.She spoke at length about the objectives of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) functioning in urban areas, like mass mobilization, party building, building the United Front and military tasks.

Keralites lead CAA protests in Finland | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India,"Thiruvananthapuram: As thousands joined human chain protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the state on Republic Day, its ripples reached as far as Finland. Indians and locals in three cities of Finland held a peaceful protest in solidarity with the protests across India. Interestingly, many youths from Kerala were active in organizing the Finland protest. More than hundred people participated in protests held in Helsinki, Tampere and Turku where they read the Preamble of the Constitution and organized speeches explaining CAA and NRC and on the importance of safeguarding India’s Constitution. “I see the passing of the CAA and current political atmosphere as an imminent threat to our constitutional values and secularism. If our country slips into a theocratic state (religious), India may never be a safe haven for millions of its religious minorities,” said Thiruvananthapuram-based Indu who is pursuing higher studies in international law and human rights in Finland. Shameer from Thrissur who works as an IT consultant in Helsinki said, “I want India to support all refugees fleeing persecution irrespective of religion. Having seen the Holocaust memorials in Germany and Poland, I am afraid of genocidal consequences of statelessness to many Muslims in India.” Holding placards with slogans against CAA and NRC written in English, Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam, the group staged dharna near popular places in their respective cities. In Helsinki, the protesters conducted a silent march through the centre of the city accompanied by police vehicles. The protesters also said instead of imposing CAA, the central government should focus on reviving the economy and developing the country. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
IUML cadres join LDF’s human chain | Kozhikode News - Times of India,"Kozhikode: Embarrassing the UDF leadership, a section of IUML workers participated in the human chain formed by the LDF against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on Republic Day. To make matters worse for the UDF, the E K faction of the Sunnis, who are the traditional vote bank for the Front, also took part in the programme. Prominent among the IUML cadres was K M Basheer, vice-president of the party’s Beypore mandalam. He told media persons on Monday that he joined the protest as the LDF was showing more sincerity in agitations. Basheer said that the Left parties succeeded in understanding the importance of the issue and acted accordingly. The Congress thoroughly failed in this regard, he said. He added that in the present scenario Congress cannot become an alternative to the BJP at the national level. A joint fight by the secular forces, including the Left, is the need of the hour. Basheer also praised chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for leading the anti-CAA agitations. “The declaration the chief minister made that CAA will not be implemented in Kerala is a great relief for the Muslim community,” Basheer said, adding that KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran is speaking in the language of an ordinary politician about a crucial issue. E K group sources told TOI that they have announced that they would join anyone in the fight against the CAA. The feeling that at least a section of the Muslim community is cozying up to the Left has given heartburn to the UDF leadership. There is already a buzz in the Muslim community that something is lacking in the UDF agitations against the CAA. K Muraleedhran, MP, said the IUML cadres participating in the LDF programme is a serious issue. He said he had spoken to the opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on the issue. “The programme UDF organised in Kozhikode last week was a grand success. We need more such programmes in future,” he said. IUML has sought to downplay the development, saying that it is a non-issue and cautioning that such trivial controversies will only help the BJP. In a statement issued here, IUML state general secretary K P A Majeed said it was the decision of the coordination committee of Muslim organizations that everyone should participate in common programmes against the CAA. But it was difficult for the UDF to join the human chain because the programme was unilaterally announced by the LDF, Majeed said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" CAA/NRC won’t affect even one Indian Muslim, assures Rajnath Singh | India News - Times of India","MANGALURU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh asserted on Monday that not a single Muslim in India would be thrown out of the country due to the proposed National Register of Citizens and that the Bharatiya Janata Party would throw its might behind the community if a single member of this community feels persecuted by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. This is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s motto of “Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas aur Sab Ka Vishwas”, he added at a pro-CAA rally here on Monday. Assailing Congress for spreading fear among Muslims regarding a law that both Houses of Parliament debated and passed, Rajnath addressed the mammoth rally organised by the BJP district unit here. He said BJP has merely fulfilled a wish that Mahatma Gandh had directed Congress to do post-Independence. This was also in the resolution adopted by the Congress Working Committee on November 25, 1947, he said. Asking the crowd if government discriminated based on religion in implementing its various flagship programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and Ayushman Bharat or in providing various infrastructure works, Rajnath wondered how the same government could discriminate with CAA. “How can the opposition accuse us of being discriminatory with this step their leaders wanted?” he asked. Reminding Congress that it implemented the NRC based on a Supreme Court directive, Rajnath said, “NRC naam ki chidiya hum (BJP) logon ne nahin laya tha!” CAA is a balm the government is using to apply to the souls of persecuted minorities from India’s theocratically ruled neighbours and is not to hurt any Indian citizen, he said, adding that Congress, seeped in hatred for the ruling government, can’t see anything good it does. Noting that there is a concerted attempt on the part of Congress to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims using the CAA, Rajnath said it wouldn’t be surprising if foreign powers were behind it. The former BJP national chief exhorted the party’s rank and file to explain to Muslims that their citizenship was not under threat and they would continue to enjoy their rights as any other citizen. Rajnath said the opposition should not forget the “national dharma”. Let the opposition question the continuing persecution of minorities in neighbouring Pakistan, he said. While CAA is only to accommodate persecuted minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the majority of whom are Dalits, why should anyone have any objection to it, he asked. Noting that as home minister in the Modi government’s first innings he had given citizenship to over 600 Muslims, including Pakistani singer Adnan Sami, Rajnath said Muslims from India’s theocratic neighbours wanting to become Indian citizens are still able to do so under CAA provisions. Even with the NPR that Congress introduced in 2010, no one will be forced to give their personal details, such as their father’s name or date of birth, he said.

‘CM not sincere in fight against CAA’ | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India,"Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said he would press for the notice issued to move a resolution in the assembly to recall governor Mohammad Arif Khan. While responding to minister A K Balan’s statement that there was no issue between the government and the governor, Chennithala said, “LDF is not genuine in its protest against the governor.” He said the opposition was forced to move a resolution as the government was not ready for it. “The governor had flouted all democratic values of the position he holds and he made a mockery of the Kerala legislature which we hold in high esteem. But the state government is unmoved despite the harsh criticisms made against the assembly and the resolution passed by its members. As a responsible opposition, we cannot remain a mute spectator when our supreme constitutional body is being targeted by a governor,” said Chennithala. The governor is continuing his tirade against the assembly and humiliating the resolution passed unanimously by the members, he said. “The governor is infact ridiculing the people of the state through his statements,” he added. “It is unfortunate and strange that the leader of the House was not ready to utter a word despite the governor making harsh criticisms against the assembly. His silence was dubious. It has to be understood that he was not sincere in his words against the CAA. The chief minister has the moral responsibility to register a protest against the comments made by the governor. Since the chief minister was silent, the opposition was forced to come out with a notice in the assembly against the governor,” he said. Chennithala alleged that the state government and BJP had an unholy nexus and the chief minister’s silence signals it. “This was the reason why the governor showered praise on the chief minister in his Republic Day speech. This has raised several suspicions,” he said. On Republic Day, the chief minister and other ministers had attended the At Home reception organized by the governor at Raj Bhavan while the opposition boycotted the event as a mark of protest.

 Citizenship seekers may have to prove faith | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) rules, being given final touches, are likely to require eligible migrants to furnish documents establishing country of origin, date of arrival prior to the cutoff and religious identity while there won’t be any need for proof of religious persecution. Migrants or refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan need to prove they belong to one of six minority faiths — Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Jain, Buddhist or Parsi. The documents recording religion of migrants applying for Indian citizenship under CAA must pertain to the period prior to December 31, 2014, a senior government functionary said. The functionary added no documents may, however, be sought to establish that the applicant came to India on account of religious persecution back home. “The ground of religious persecution includes fear of religious persecution as well. So, no documentation may be necessary,” the functionary said. Sources indicated that the CAA rules may not allow the state administration much role in processing applications. “State and local administration’s role will be minimal. While the application process will be entirely online, a central authority may be designated in the states to process claims,” a source said. It was pointed out that CAA rules are likely to incorporate the suggestion made by Assam government for a short, time-bound application window for Bangladeshi migrants in the state. Indications are that documentation requirements for citizenship applications under CAA may extensively borrow from existing long-term visa policy for migrants belonging to six minority faiths in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Any document issued by the governments of Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan or from any government authority or agency clearly showing the religion of the applicant — like a school certificate for example — can be furnished to establish membership of minority community. Similarly, citizenship of the applicant for long-term visa can be proved by furnishing documents such as copy of the old passport or any other document issued by government authorities or agencies in these countries such as birth certificate, educational certificate by board or university, certificate of enrolment and study in schools, government-issued license, land and tenancy records. Documents to prove the date of entry of long-term visa applicant into India include slip issued by census enumerators in India to such persons while conducting NPR prior to December 31, 2014, insurance policies issued by companies in India, bank and/or post office account, court and tribunal records in India, government-issued licence and land and tenancy records, permanent residential certificate, document showing service or employment, gram panchayat secretary certificate and Aadhaar card (all issued in India).

 West Bengal becomes 4th state to pass anti-CAA resolution | India News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal assembly on Monday passed a resolution against “the interrelated” CAA, NRC and NPR, becoming the fourth state after Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan to make the move. Congress and Left Front added muscle to Trinamool Congress’s opposition and the single BJP MLA present in the assembly was the lone voice of dissent. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee called the CAA a law that is “a shame to humanity and civilisation” and sought its immediate withdrawal. The resolution found “giving citizenship on the basis of religion and community” as “against the multifaceted democratic structure of the country”. “So this assembly, through the state government, wants to appeal to the Centre to repeal CAA… and withdraw the interrelated NRC and NPR,” it said. Accusing BJP of trying to divide India on the basis of religion and spreading intolerance and hatred, Mamata said CAA is not only anti-people but also goes against the spirit of the Constitution. “BJP may have numbers but that does not give it the right to mould the country according to its agenda,” she said. “We want CAA to be repealed and will not allow NRC or NPR to be implemented in this country.

 CAA an effort to divide society on religious lines: Yashwant Sinha | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday said the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is against the basic structure of the Constitution and there was no need for the law as the government already had the power to grant citizenship. “The move is an attempt to divide the society on religious basis and take the country back to pre-1947 era,” Sinha told reporters during his visit to Lucknow. Sinha is currently on a 3000-km ‘Gandhi Shanti March’. “Singer Adnan Sami was granted citizenship under the old citizenship law and was also conferred with Padma award. Sonia Gandhi and Bade Ghulam Ali had also acquired Indian citizenship in the same manner. There was no need to amend the law and give a religious colour to it,” he said. Sinha claimed India’s relations with Bangladesh and Afghanistan turned sour after CAA came into force. “There is a constitutional crisis as the Centre is ignoring state governments which are passing anti-CAA resolutions. The country is also facing social unrest and chaos but instead of reaching out to protesters, the government is suppressing their voice,” he said. “Uttar Pradesh has become the epicentre of violence during anti-CAA protests. People are staging dharna peacefully but their blankets and quilts are being snatched and they are being arrested. Is it not terrorism,” he asked. He said the BJP government had buckled to opposition and public pressure in the past and would have to listen to people in case of CAA too. Terming recent statements by senior BJP leaders against CAA protesters as an outcome of desperation of the governments at the Centre and in UP, he said, “The government wants to divert people’s attention from issues like lawlessness, unemployment and suicides by farmers which have taken a backseat.” He said the country’s image as a developing democracy had received a setback across the globe due to the amended citizenship law. “European Union parliament has brought in a resolution against CAA. I am against this step but the government will have to be accountable for denting India’s image in the world,” he said, adding immigration was a global issue and not India’s problem alone.

 'Respect sovereign processes of fellow legislatures': Om Birla to EU Parliament prez over CAA resolution | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: With the European Union Parliament set to introduce an anti-CAA resolution, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla on Monday wrote to the EU Parliament president saying it was ""inappropriate"" for one legislature to pass judgment on another. The resolution, tabled by European United Left/Nordic Green Left Group, is set to be debated on Wednesday and voted upon the day after. In his letter addressed to president of the European Parliament Brussels, David Maria Sassoli, Birla said, ""As members of the Inter Parliamentary Union, we should respect the sovereign processes of fellow legislatures, especially in democracies. It is inappropriate for one legislature to pass judgement on another, a practice that can surely be misused by vested interests."" The Lok Sabha speaker asserted the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was aimed at granting easier citizenship to those who have been subjected to religious persecution in India's neighbourhood. He also mentioned that the legislation was passed after due deliberation by both Houses of the Indian Parliament. Birla also asserted that the act was not aimed at taking away citizenship from anybody. In his letter, Birla urged Sassoli to consider the proposed resolution, saying that he was confident that an ""unhealthy precedent"" would not be set. The government had earlier urged the sponsors and supporters of the draft resolution to engage with India to get a full and accurate assessment of the facts before taking any further action. The government had also reiterated that CAA was not discrimination against any religion and that even European societies in the past had followed the same approach. Official government sources had maintained that the CAA was an entirely internal matter of India and that the legislation was adopted through democratic means after a debate in both houses of Parliament. The draft resolution made a reference to the Charter of the United Nations, Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the India-EU Strategic Partnership Joint Action Plan signed in November 2005, and to the EU-India Thematic Dialogue on Human Rights. Of the 751 members of the EU Parliament, 626 have moved six resolutions on the twin issues of CAA and reorganisation of J&K. “The CAA marks a dangerous shift in the way citizenship will be determined in India,” the resolution said. “Instead of addressing concerns, offering corrective action, calling for security forces to act with restraint and ensuring accountability, many government leaders have been engaging in efforts to discredit, rebuke and threaten the protesters,” it said.

" Not a single Indian Muslim will be affected by either CAA, NRC: Rajnath Singh | India News - Times of India","MANGALURU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh while asserting that not a single Muslim in India will be thrown out of the country due to National Register of Citizens (NRC) said the Bharatiya Janata Party will throw its might behind the community if a single member of this community feels persecuted by Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). This is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s credo of Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas aur Sab Ka Vishwas, he noted. Assailing Congress for spreading sense of fear among Muslims regarding a law that both houses of parliament debated on and passed, Rajnath addressing a mammoth public awareness rally on CAA/NRC organised by district unit of BJP on Monday, said BJP has merely fulfilled wish that Gandhiji had directed the Congress to do post-Independence. This was also in the resolution adopted by Congress Working Committee on November 25, 1947, he said. Asking the crowd if government discriminated based on religion in implementing its various flagship programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, Ayushman Bharat or in providing various infrastructure works, Rajnath wondered how the same government could discriminate among its citizens with CAA. “How can the opposition now accuse us of being discriminatory with this step their leaders wanted,” he quipped. Reminding the Congress that it implemented the NRC based on a Supreme Court directive, Rajnath said, “NRC naam ki chidiya hum (BJP) logon ne nahin laya tha!” CAA is a balm that the government is using to apply on souls of persecuted minorities from India’s theocratically ruled neighbours and is not to hurt any Indian citizen, he said, adding that Congress that is seeped in hatred for the ruling government can’t see anything good in what it does. Noting that there is a concerted attempt on part of the Congress to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims using the CAA, Rajnath said it will not be a wonder if there are foreign powers too behind this move. The former BJP national chief exhorted the party’s rank and file to explain to the Muslims that their citizenship is not under any threat and they will continue to enjoy their rights as any other citizen of the country continues to do. Appealing to the opposition to follow the ‘opposition dharma’, Rajnath said in doing so, they should not forget the ‘national dharma’. Instead let the opposition question the continuing persecution of the minorities in neighbouring Pakistan, he said. While the CAA is only to accommodate persecuted minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, majority of whom are Dalits, why should anyone have any objection to it, he wondered. Noting that as home minister in Modi government’s first innings he had given citizenship to more than 600 Muslims including Pakistani singer Adnan Sami, Rajnath said Muslims from ‘theocratic’ neighbouring countries wanting to become Indian citizens are still able to do so under CAA provisions. Even with NPR that Congress introduced in 2010, no one will be forced to give their personal details such as their father’s name or date of birth, he said.

" For France, new citizenship law internal matter of India: French govt sources | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: France, a founding member of the European Union, considers the new citizenship law an internal political matter of India, French diplomatic sources said on Monday. The assertion came after close to 600 lawmakers in the 751-member parliament moved six resolutions against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), saying the enactment of the law marked a dangerous shift in India's citizenship regime. For France, the CAA is India's internal political matter and it has been stated on several occasions, the sources said. They said the European Parliament is an institution independent of member states and the European Commission. The new law, passed by Parliament last month, offers citizenship to non-Muslim persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. India has been witnessing massive protests against the new law with opposition parties, civil rights groups and activists saying that granting citizenship based on religion is against the foundational principles of the Constitution. There has been no reaction from the Ministry of External Affairs on the resolutions against the CAA in European Parliament. Official sources, however, maintained that the CAA was an entirely internal matter of India and that the legislation was adopted through democratic means after a debate in both houses of Parliament. ""Every society that fashions a pathway to naturalisation contemplates both a context and criteria. This is not discrimination,"" a government source said, explaining why India is opposed to the resolutions at the EU parliament. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
CAA:   Proof of religious beliefs to be required for applying citizenship under CAA | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will have to provide proofs of their religious beliefs while applying for Indian citizenship under the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAA), officials said on Monday. The applicants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain or Parsi faiths will also have to furnish documents to prove that they entered India on or before December 31, 2014. Those who will seek Indian citizenship under the CAA will have to provide proofs of their religious beliefs and this will be mentioned in the rules to be issued under the CAA, a government official said. According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014, due to religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants and will be given Indian citizenship. The central government is also likely to give a relatively smaller window of just three months to those who want to apply for Indian citizenship in Assam under the CAA, another official said. Some Assam-specific provisions are expected to be incorporated in the rules to be issued for the implementation of the CAA. Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and his finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had made a request about a fortnight ago to keep a limited period window for applying under the CAA and also incorporate some other Assam-specific provisions in the CAA rules. The move comes in view of continuing protests against the CAA in Assam that have been going on since the legislation was passed by Parliament in December last year. There has been a growing feeling among the indigenous people of Assam that the newly enacted legislation will hurt their interests politically, culturally as well as socially. The Assam Accord provides for detection and deportation of all illegal immigrants who have entered the country after 1971 and are living in the state, irrespective of their religion. The protesters in Assam say that the CAA violates the provisions of the Assam Accord. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 ED finds 'financial links' between PFI and anti-CAA protests in UP | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has found that the recent violent protests in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) had an alleged ""financial link"" with the Kerala-based Popular Front of India (PFI), a claim termed as ""baseless"" by the organisation. Official sources said on Monday that the federal probe agency, which is investigating the PFI under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) since 2018, has found that at least Rs 1.04 crore were deposited in several bank accounts linked to the organisation between December 4 last year and January 6 this year in various parts of the country. This was the time when Parliament passed the law to grant citizenship to non-Muslims who were persecuted on religious grounds in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The sources said a total amount of Rs 120 crore, credited to bank accounts linked to the PFI, is under the ED's scanner. ""The Popular Front of India has stated it multiple times that we fully comply with the law of the land and the allegation of Rs 120 crore transferred from the Popular Front's accounts just before the CAA protests is totally baseless and the people who are levelling these allegations should prove these claims,"" the organisation said in a statement. The sources claimed that these dubious deposits were either made in cash or through the immediate payment service (IMPS) and a number of such instances were seen in Uttar Pradesh, where the maximum number of violent anti-CAA protests were reported to have taken place. Quoting the ED findings, the sources said that the withdrawal of money from the bank accounts linked to PFI and its related entities had a ""direct correlation"" with the violent demonstrations against the CAA. It is suspected and alleged that these funds were used by PFI affiliates to fuel the anti-CAA protests in various parts of Uttar Pradesh and other locations, the sources said. The PFI said the allegations levelled against it were unfounded. ""We are confident that the fate of this series of allegations will also be like the ones before, which could never be proved. ""Recently, the UP and Assam governments alleged Popular Front's role in the anti-CAA protests-related violence and even arrested our state-level leaders. But their claims proved to be nothing but imagination when they could not prove anything in court and our leaders were released on bail,"" the organisation said. The Popular Front, it said, will not be bowed down by ""such cheap campaigning by the forces backed by the fascist who wants to stop us"". The sources claimed that there were instances of about 80-90 money withdrawals from one bank account in a day during the stated period. They said the ED had also shared these findings with the Union home ministry's internal security division after the latter asked it to obtain facts. The Uttar Pradesh police also sought a ban on the PFI recently, days after its alleged complicity was suspected in the statewide violent protests against the amended citizenship law. Nearly 20 people had died during these protests. The ED, the sources said, found out that the funds deposited in banks were also routed from foreign shores and sent to the accounts of certain investment firms. A National Investigation Agency FIR and chargesheet against the PFI formed the basis for the ED to file the PMLA case against the organisation. The PFI was formed in 2006 in Kerala as a successor to the National Democratic Front (NDF). Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 '56-inch chest' govt will have to bow to people's wishes: Yashwant Sinha on CAA stir | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Terming the Citizenship Amendment Act as ""unconstitutional"", former Union minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday said the ""government with a 56-inch chest"" will have to shed its arrogance on the new citizenship law and bend before the people who have been protesting against the law in large numbers across the country. The former BJP leader also slammed Union home minister Amit Shah for his remarks that the government would not take the CAA back and people could do whatever they can. ""The Citizenship Amendment Act is against the basic structure of the Constitution. There was no need for this kind of amendment in the citizenship law as the Government of India already had the power to grant citizenship to anyone. This law cannot be implemented,"" Sinha said at a press conference in Lucknow where Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav was also present. Sinha said as per the previous law, India's citizenship could be given to anyone just as it was given to, for example, (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi who was born in Italy and Pakistani singer Adnan Sami. ""There was no need to amend the said law on a religious basis. This cannot be implemented. It is the government's duty to reach out to people who have been protesting against the CAA, and resolve their problem and create an environment of peace in the country. The government with a 56-inch chest will have to bend before the people,"" he said, taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's macho image who had once said that it took a ""56-inch chest"" to teach India's enemies a lesson"". Slamming Amit Shah's remarks over the CAA, Sinha said, ""The Union home minister gave a statement that he would not move an inch back on CAA. It is not a democratic statement. Does it behove a home minister to speak like this? The remark shows the arrogance of power."" Sinha alleged that all the BJP-led governments in the states are using ""policy of suppression"".

" CAA: PM Modi's nationalism masks a bad economy, protesters say | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Through some of the coldest nights in a century, the students of New Delhi gathered outside the city's police headquarters. They chanted anti-government slogans, recited Pakistani resistance poets, and flashed witty posters to make a stand against a new citizenship law that excludes Muslims. As the confrontations continue across the country, though, they've morphed into a wider protest against economic prospects and financial disparities. Violence flared at campuses as the authorities cracked down on the demonstrations that have become Prime Minister Narendra Modi's biggest test since he won power more than five years ago. ""Their handling of the economy is disastrous,"" said Akshay Bajaj, 29, a post-doctoral student who helped organize protests at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur. ""There are no jobs, falling growth and rocketing prices for vegetables."" Like so many of the protests across the world that have defined the last 12 months, the contentious legislation in India was effectively just a tipping point for the under 30s. With tear gas clouds sweeping across Beirut again this week and regular clashes in Hong Kong, the students in New Delhi and Mumbai have added to the sense of global malaise. The protests were triggered by a new law called the Citizenship Amendment Act that fast-tracks religious minorities from three neighboring countries, except for Muslims. They intensified after police stormed the Jamia Millia Islamia university in December to crush what it said were acts of vandalism. In solidarity, students spilled out of colleges across the capital and even elite management and technology schools to protest against Modi and his confidante Amit Shah, India's powerful minister for internal security. ""Nationalism, far from being reversed, made further headway,"" billionaire philanthropist George Soros told the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, according to excerpts from his speech. The biggest and ""most frightening setback,"" he said, was in India. Protesters say the law undermines India's Constitution, which treats all religions equally. They fear it will be misused, together with a proposed National Citizens' Register, to disenfranchise poor Muslims who lack the documents to prove their residency. The government instead should have expended its energy on reversing the worst economic slump in a decade and the highest unemployment rate in 45 years. ""The government doesn't attempt to answer the grievances of the people, it is instead distracting us with these kind of issues,"" said Mihir Jain, 26, a chartered accountant who last month participated in his first ever public protest. ""If today we allow them to go ahead with this, we don't know what will come next."" Peaceful protests continued last week, with at least two dozen rallies and sit-ins in Mumbai and New Delhi and several others scattered across the country. The Supreme Court on Wednesday deferred a hearing on cases challenging the constitutional validity of the citizenship law. A human chain is planned for January 30, the anniversary of the slaying of Mahatma Gandhi by a Hindu fundamentalist, according to messages being shared on college WhatsApp groups. Economic anxiety served as the kindling for the protests while the new legislation was the spark, said Milan Vaishnav, director for the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Then as food prices spiked, the demonstrations turned into a focal point for many strands of disenchantment with the government, he said. Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party says the new law will offer refuge to persecuted minorities from India's neighboring countries and it won't impact any Indian citizen. It sees the rebellion as a reflection of how the law is misunderstood. Party member Baijayant Panda told Bloomberg Television on Thursday that the government has started an outreach program to explain it more clearly. ""You've had TV bites where they aren't able to say why exactly they are protesting,"" said Panda. ""Some think they are protesting against inflation."" While India's economy ballooned to about $3 trillion since the nation adopted its constitution in 1950, much of the population remains left behind. Modi swept to power in 2014 promising India's poor and middle classes he'd restore their "" dignity"" after years of inequality. Yet Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group AG estimated the richest 10% of Indians held 74% of the country's wealth in 2019, up from 62% in 2012. S Subramanian, a member of the advisory board of the World Bank's Commission on Global Poverty, said underlying data from a government report leaked in November indicate that an even larger share of Indians have slipped into poverty. The government says it has concerns about the quality of this database. About 30% of Indian youth aged 15-29 are not in employment, education or training, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, more than double the average. India's economy is forecast to grow 5% in the year ending March 2020, the slowest pace since 2009, and inflation accelerated last month to the fastest since 2014. Modi's administration will present its annual budget on February 1 and analysts say it's unlikely to have adequate tools to combat the economic slowdown as the deficit swells. Meanwhile the pushback is being led by the very people who were considered a potential new support base for Modi and are now disenchanted with the lurch toward Hindu nationalism. His campaign in 2019 was fueled by a combination of Hindu nationalism, economic populism and air strikes against arch-rival Pakistan. The new citizenship laws were among Modi's promises; he won the vote with a massive majority. Shrishti Parihar, 19, said the legislation acts as a convenient smokescreen for the government. Until recently, she was discussing job security with her friends, but now Modi and Shah talk of nothing but religion, she said. ""The economy is in such bad shape—that should be our main concern,"" said Parihar. ""Instead, we are talking Hindu-Muslim."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Pro-Pak elements infiltrating anti-CAA protests in US; pushing own agenda: Indian-American leader | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: Pro-Pakistani elements have infiltrated the anti-CAA protests in the US to execute their hidden agenda against India, an Indian-American community leader has said. During a recent protest against the CAA in Washington DC, posters were seen reflective of the presence of pro-Pakistani elements. Not only this, at least two Pakistani-Americans were among the main organisers of the anti-CAA protests in Washington DC on Sunday, claimed Indian-American community leader Adapa Prasad. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) came into force in India last December amid protests in India and around the world. The Indian government has stressed that the new Act does not deny any citizenship rights but has been brought in to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and provide them citizenship. ""Darakshan Raja, a Pakistani-American activist who also co-ordinates Kashmiri separatist protests in Washington DC area along with another Pakistani-American Muslim activist named Khudai Tanveer, were one of the main coordinators of the anti-CAA protests,"" Prasad told PTI. Prasad and his team shared videos and pictures of the individuals from the anti-CAA protests in Washington DC, which was attended by more than 500 Indian-Americans from in and around the city. Prasad said one of the posters written in Urdu said “Hans ke Liya hai Pakistan, Larr ke lengey Hindustan”. ""This in English means we easily got Pakistan, now we will fight out to get India,"" he said as he shared the picture of the said poster. ""This is disgusting. Pro-ISI and pro-Pakistani elements are using this protest to execute their hidden agenda which is depicted in their own poster,"" Prasad said. He said the protests are also being misused by pro-Khalistani activists to push their agenda. ""Arjun Sethi, a pro Khalistani activist, was also amongst the coordinators of the anti-CAA rally,"" Prasad said. Sethi had recently testified before a Congressional Committee on Kashmir. In recent weeks, some of the Indian-Americans, during private conversation in WhatsApp groups, had expressed apprehensions that their anti-CAA protests could be misused by elements close to ISI and Pakistan.

 Jinnah's idea winning in India: Shashi Tharoor on CAA | India News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said if the CAA leads to the implementation of the NPR and the NRC, it would be a complete victory for Pakistan's founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He said Jinnah's idea of a country was already winning in India with the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) coming into effect, but asserted that there was still a choice available. ""I would not say Jinnah has completely won, but I would say Jinnah is winning. There is still a choice available to the nation between Jinnah's idea of a country and Gandhiji's idea of a country,"" he said on the sidelines of the Jaipur Literature Festival on Sunday. The CAA came into force in India in December amid protests across the country and around the world. The MP from Thiruvananthapuram said the amended Citizenship Act took Jinnah's logic by declaring that religion shall be the basis of nationhood, reaffirming that Gandhi's idea is that all religions are equal . ""The CAA is, if you are talking Tennis, you would say one set up or big first set lead for Jinnah. But the next step would be if the CAA would lead to the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). If that happens, then you would consider that Jinnah's victory is complete,"" he said. The CAA seeks to grant citizenship to migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014. On the BJP's defence that the NPR was carried out during the UPA regime, Tharoor said the Congress government had utilised a decision of the NDA government led by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. ""It never asked where were your parents born. It never authorised the enumerators to note on the margin 'dubious citizenship', a term used in the NPR rules crafted by this government. That is purely BJP's invention,"" he said. If we go around this country authorising people to interview all the citizens, or identify some who have 'dubious citizenship', you can be pretty sure which Indians are going to be found on the 'dubious citizenship', he said. ""That will principally be one community that is not mentioned in the CAA. And if that happens, then it is indeed Jinnah's victory. ""From wherever he is, he can point to this place and say, 'see I was right in the 1940. We are separate nations and Muslims deserved their own country because Hindus cannot be just',"" Tharoor said. Speaking about the Delhi election, the three-time MP said the maximum development in the national capital happened under the Congress government. ""What Sheila Dikshit did in her 15 years as chief minister of Delhi, no other leader could do it before or after her,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" Amid CAA debate, govt tells House 97% of displaced Tamils resettled in Lanka | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: At a time when their “exclusion” from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act has been raised by opposition parties, the government has said 97% of internally displaced persons (IDP), primarily Tamils, had been resettled in the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. Some 883,185 IDPs who were displaced in the three-decade internal conflict had been resettled, leaving around 36,000 people who needed to be catered to, the ministry of external affairs, quoting Sri Lankan government statistics, told DMK MP from Chennai South Sumathy Thamizhachi in the winter session. Responding to a question on the number of IDPs and the assistance given to them by India, the government detailed various measures, including Rs 1,372 crore in grants for construction of 50,000 houses, as Indian help to Tamils affected by the prolonged civil war in Sri Lanka. The figures indicate that there may be no pressing need for Tamils from Sri Lanka to seek citizenship since they have been resettled in large numbers as against non-Muslim minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, many of whom lack the option of returning to their countries due to fear of religious persecution. India has provided citizenship to more than 4.5 lakh Tamils from Sri Lanka between 1964 and 2008. Critics of CAA have argued that around 1 lakh displaced persons in camps in India have been unfairly left out of the law’s ambit. Senior ministers like Nirmala Sitharaman have said not being eligible under CAA does not mean they will be debarred from Indian citizenship. She pointed out the facility offered to Sri Lankan Tamils earlier was not at that point extended to minorities from other nations. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act covers Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains from designated nations. In its reply in Parliament, the government said Indian projects included family packs, roofing sheets, cement bags, bicycles, tractors, seeds, boats and fishing nets. “Of 50,000 houses committed, 46,000 housing units were meant for IDPs in northern and eastern provinces and they have been completed and handed over to beneficiaries,” the government said. Other development works included classrooms in 27 schools, 3,000 rainwater harvesting units and the Palaly airport and hospital buildings in Batticaloa in the eastern province. Assistance is also being provided to colleges and for sanitation. Railway lines between north and south are being completed under Indian line of credit.

 European Parliament to debate on anti-CAA resolution | India News - Times of India,"LONDON: The European Parliament is set to debate and vote on a resolution tabled by some of its members against India's Citizenship Amendment Act, which it says marks a “dangerous shift” in the country's citizenship regime. The resolution, tabled by the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) Group in the Parliament earlier this week, is set to be debated next Wednesday and voted on the day after. It makes a reference to the Charter of the United Nations, Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as well as the India-EU Strategic Partnership Joint Action Plan signed in November 2005, and to the EU-India Thematic Dialogue on Human Rights as it urges the Indian authorities to ""engage constructively"" with those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and consider their demands to repeal the ""discriminatory CAA"". ""The CAA marks a dangerous shift in the way citizenship will be determined in India and is set to create the largest statelessness crisis in the world and cause immense human suffering,"" it notes. ""Instead of addressing the concerns, offering corrective action, calling for security forces to act with restraint and ensuring accountability, many government leaders have been engaging in efforts to discredit, rebuke and threaten the protesters,"" the resolution states. The CAA came into force in India last December amid protests in India and around the world. The Indian government has stressed that the new Act does not deny any citizenship rights but has been brought in to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and provide them citizenship. As background, the resolution sets out that since the May 2019 election, the government of India has “reinforced its nationalistic orientation” as it also makes a reference to the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, which removed the special constitutional status of the region. The draft resolution, which falls under the category of “Resolutions on topical subjects”, expresses deep concern that India has “created the legal grounds to strip millions of Muslims of the fundamental right of equal access to citizenship” and that the CAA could be used, along with the National Register of Citizens, to “render many Muslim citizens stateless”. It seeks to remind the Indian government of its obligations under the 1992 UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, which establishes the obligation of countries to protect the existence and identity of religious minorities within their territories and to adopt appropriate measures to ensure that this is achieved. Such a resolution, which has been characterised under the “Relations with Asian countries” section by the economic bloc, are used as a basis for engagement of EU member countries with specific nations. If it is passed next week, it will be formally sent to the Indian government and Parliament as well as to the European Commission chiefs. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Republic Day celebrated in East; bomb blasts in Assam, CAA protests | India News - Times of India","GUWAHATI/KOLKATA/PATNA: The 71st Republic Day was celebrated with pomp and pageantry across the eastern region on Sunday, even as four serial explosions rocked Assam early in the day, and sparse protests over the new citizenship law were reported from parts of the state and neighbouring West Bengal. Barring Meghalaya, where Tathagata Roy is on leave since December, governors in their respective states, unfurled the Tricolour and presided over the ceremonial parade, amid heightened security. In Assam, four power explosions -- three in Dibrugarh and one in Charaideo districts -- shook Upper Assam, with police sources suspecting it to be a handiwork of ULFA (Independent) militants, who had called for a boycott of Republic Day celebrations. All four blasts occurred in a span of 10 minutes -- between 8.15 and 8.25 am, a police officer said, adding no casualty had been reported, as Republic Day being a holiday, people were mostly indoors. Later in the day, Governor Jagdish Mukhi said the Assam government was committed to protect the political, cultural and linguistic rights of indigenous people and a committee, headed by retired Gauhati High Court judge Biplab Sharma, would soon submit a report in this regard. Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and BJP MLA Angoorlata Deka were shown black flags by anti-CAA protesters at separate locations in the state, when they were on their way to attend functions. In West Bengal, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar led the celebrations, as he hoisted the national flag and inspected the parade by armed forces and police personnel. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who attended the programme along with cabinet colleagues, greeted the governor at the conclusion of the programme. Members of an interfaith group came out on the streets in state capital Kolkata and formed human chains in various parts of the city, as a mark of protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. In Jharkhand, Governor Droupadi Murmu insisted that unemployment was a burning issue and the government would take initiative to fill vacancies at panchayat offices and state departments. At a separate function, Chief Minister Hemant Soren called upon people to work for the welfare of the state, rising above their cultural and religious identities. Expressing concern over climate change, Bihar Governor Fagu Chauhan stressed on the importance of environment conservation on the occasion and lauded the Nitish Kumar government for its efforts to generate awareness on the issue. He also spoke about the steps being taken by the government to ensure welfare of the weaker sections of the society, including Dalits and minorities. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who was the guest of honour at the state capital's Republic Day programme, led by Governor Ganeshi Lal, exhorted people to work selflessly for the benefit of the state. Cultural diversity was on display at Republic Day celebrations in Nagaland, where Governor and Centre's interlocutor for Naga peace talks, R N Ravi, on Saturday asserted that ""differences should be resolved through peaceful dialogue, and not under the shadow of guns"". State Justice and Law Minister C M Chang, speaking at an event in Dimapur, said, ""The Centre's negotiations with all Naga political groups have concluded successfully and we are now hopeful for an early solution."" In a departure from tradition, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma unfurled the Tricolour in Shillong and shared with people his government vision for the state's development in the next 10 years. Contending that the state's core strength lay in the fact that 75 per cent of its three-million population were aged below 34 years, Sangma said his government was taking all measures to ""impart quality education and skill-based training"" to the youth. In Arunachal Pradesh, Governor B D Mishra said satellite-based monitoring and geo-tagging technology would be employed to keep a tab on all development projects in the state. He urged people to fight against corruption. In Mizoram, too, Governor PS Sreedharan Pillai appealed to people to strive for excellence and make concerted efforts to usher in integrated development.

Anti-CAA resolution by Rajasthan government unconstitutional: BJP | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: State BJP president Satish Poonia on Saturday said the resolution passed against CAA, a law made by the Parliament, was an ‘unconstitutional’ move by the Gehlot government. Poonia said the BJP will oppose the move at all possible public platforms. While talking to the mediapersons at the gate of Vidhan Sabha, Poonia said that Gehlot has blatantly demolished the Constitution and has lost right to remain on any constitutional post. “Congress should read that Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi had told that if the Hindus and Sikhs will face any problem in Pakistan will be persecuted they will have full right to come to India,” said Poonia. He reiterated that in the federal cooperative system state cannot oppose any act passed by the parliament. “Granting citizenship is a matter that comes under the purview of Centre. Who has given you the right to challenge the CAA. This has been done as a part of your appeasement policy and vote bank politics,” said leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria in the assembly. On excluding Muslims from CAA, he said, “Yeh Koi Dharamshalla nahin ki sabko daal do (India is not a free place to accommodate anyone).” Supporting the CAA, Kataria said, “We should sincerely think how Hindu minority is being harassed and supressed in Pakistan and if these people apply for Indian citizenship they should be given it respectfully,” he said. Former education minister Vasudev Devnani questioned Congress of even having an idea of the pain caused to the refugees from Pakistan. “I am the victim of the religious persecution in Pakistan as my family had to flee leaving behind our culture, history and spiritual abode. The stories of partition and persecution heard from my elders are still fresh in my memory. What BJP did was to make the procedure of citizenship bit easier and convenient for the minorities from across the border. And what Congress did was a historical blunder which the people of the country will never forgive him,” said Devnani. MLA from Ramganj Mandhi Madan Dilwar minced no words in attacking the government in the parliament. He said, “I am openly challenging the government to try and make a law against the implementation of CAA in the state,” said Dilawar, who called the passing of a resolution means ‘nothing’ in the federal system.

"CAA and NRC protests: Tongue in cheek, protesters drive home point with posters, memes | Kolkata News - Times of India","KOLKATA: Defiant protesters are not only taking part in night vigils and rallies to voice their angst against CAA and NRC, they are also using satire and tongue-in-cheek slogans to back their demonstrations, using humour as a form of resistance. Some posters and memes are witty — Bure din wapas kardo (return the bad days), read one of the them, mocking the BJP slogan of acche din (good days) before the 2014 elections — while some others convey a serious message about the unity of the country — jab Hindu Muslim razi toh kya karega Nazi — sending a subtle message to politicians to refrain from divisive politics. When PM Narendra Modi arrived in Kolkata on January 11, protesters blocked all thoroughfares so that Modi could not reach Raj Bhavan. One of them read: Raasta bondho. Desh meramoter kaaj cholche (The road is shut. Nation rebuilding is underway). On January 10, a young law student arrived at an anti-CAA protest on Mayo Road with a poster that read azadi mera dulha hai (azadi is my groom), bringing back memories of Bhagat Singh, who had told the British “Azadi meri dulhan hai (azadi is my bride)”. Another student carried a poster that read “yahan tobacco chorna itna mushkil hai aur yeh kehte hain desh chhor do’ (it is so difficult to quit chewing tobacco and they demand us to leave the country). It poked fun at politicians in the ruling regime who threaten to send people to Pakistan when they disagree with their discourse. “Humour helps to connect. It also reduces fear because you are not scared of something that you laugh at. This is important as fear is being used as a tool to push back the protesters,” said Sreya Sengupta, a student of Presidency University who has been tickling the funny bone with her posters at several protests. Earlier, political humour and satire was the preserve of big writers but today, even ordinary citizens are taking a dig at politicians due to the changing political climate and internet. Protesters said every time politicians speak, they provide enough content either due to the faux pas, slogans or flawed understanding of the country and its people. A young man in Kolkata started attending protests wearing symbols of most religions painted on his face and attires of most faiths after PM Modi in one of his political rallies in Jharkhand said the protesters can be identified by their attire. “I am Ram Bismil Singh Robert,” he says while holding aloft a poster saying “Pehchan Kaun? (identify who I am)”. Many people also feel humour is an important release valve and coping mechanism under a “majoritarian rule”. “Using humour is also an attempt by citizens to counter balance prejudice and bigotry and poke fun at them,” said Prasanta Dasgupta, a political scientist.

"Goa: Churchill Alemao says he’s against CAA, but will continue to back government | Goa News - Times of India","COLVA: NCP MLA Churchill Alemao said that he would move a resolution in the assembly against CAA, but would continue to support the BJP government in the state.

Asked whether he would withdraw his support to the government if it does not allow his resolution, he said, for a resolution to be move, he needs the support of other members of the House.

Gangavathi city general secretary of BJP Shivakumar Ambalayya Arakeri said he attended the poetry recital held on January 9 as part of the Utsav. “Poet Siraj Bisaralli recited a poem against CAA and NRC, and criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi using defamatory words.

Poet Bisaralli, who works with a private television channel, said that the invite to the event was based on his literary contributions. “Some political workers had objected to my poem during the recital. Now I am informed that a complaint is registered against me. I have authored two anthologies of poems in the past and have participated in many state-level literary conventions. I had never faced such a situation,” he said. Bisaralli said he is trying to get an anticipatory bail. “If I fail, I will abide by the law and try to protect myself under purview of law,” he said.

DMK will never allow the project,” said Stalin at a public meeting at Mayiladuthurai on Saturday to mark language martyrs day. Besides holding chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami responsible for the hydrocarbon projects, the opposition leader criticized him on several issues including Neet, Pollachi sex scandal and alleged corruption in highways contract. “EPS writes to the Prime Minister on hydrocarbon projects, but only for namesake. The PM will not even open the letter because that is the respect he has for EPS. The central government did not even respect the resolution passed in Tamil Nadu assembly against Neet,” he said adding that DMK had announced demonstrations in eight districts including delta on January 28 against the proposed hydrocarbon projects. Stalin said EPS was unmindful of the adversities being faced by the people in the delta districts. “Over 5 lakh acres of samba crop failed in the past eight years of their rule in the delta region.

The father of the groom, a tea vendor, has not only printed slogans supporting the Act on the wedding card of his son, but has also urged people to vote for the BJP and Narendra Modi as a gift to his son and daughter-in-law, whose wedding is to be solemnized on February 9. The family has also invited Prime Minister Modi and home minister Amit Shah for the wedding. Amit Khandelwal (27), who has done his master’s in commerce and is presently running an e-mitra kiosk in Sikar, while talking to TOI on Saturday said, “Due to lack of knowledge, people are protesting against the CAA and NRC everywhere. They are only protesting against the possibilities. Our family supports the CAA and NRC, thus I planned to get a card published with these slogans. It will inspire more people.” The family has also put a photo of the Prime Minister on the wedding card. “Some people are misleading the country and are indulging in violent protests. I urge people to maintain peace and harmony,” he added. Khandelwal is the eldest son of Mohan Lal Khandelwal, who runs a tea stall and a flour mill in Sikar town. “Rather than creating confusion, people should appreciate what Modiji and Amit Shahji are doing for the country. I hope our small act will inspire many,” said Mohan Lal. The family has also sent the wedding invitation card to the PM and the home minister. “We had sent it by registered post and have also received the acknowledgement confirming the receipt of these cards,” said Mohan Lal. The family has so far distributed 700 wedding invitation cards with the slogan, “We support NRC & CAA” and with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan logo.

Rajasthan becomes third state to pass resolution against CAA | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: Rajasthan Assembly on Saturday passed a resolution urging the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act amid opposition by the BJP which accused the ruling Congress of pursuing appeasement politics.  It is the third state to pass a resolution against CAA state after Punjab and Kerala. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said, “We have urged the central govt to repeal the law as it discriminates people on religious grounds, which violates the provisions of our Constitution. This is the first time in the history of the nation that a law has been enacted which discriminates people on religious grounds. It violates secular principles of our Constitution and also Article 14 of our Constitution.” “A number of states have been opposing NRC and CAA keeping in mind public opinion at large. It is the duty of the Centre to keep the federal structure intact n strong. I urge the NDA govt to come forward and withdraw the Act. Govt should not make it a prestige issue,” he tweeted. The resolution, which was passed by voice vote, also asked the Centre to withdraw the new questionnaire for preparation of the National Population Register (NPR), 2020 as people would face inconvenience with the proposed additional information.  “The preamble of the Constitution clearly states that India is a secular country. It is a basic feature of the Constitution that cannot be changed. However, the CAA, which has been enacted by Parliament, is aimed at distinguishing illegal migrants on the basis of religion. Such discrimination of people on the grounds of the religion is not in consonance with the secular ideas enshrined in the Constitution and is a clear violation of Article 14,” the resolution stated. The resolution has incorporated objections against NPR and NRC and has urged the Centre to start the Census work only after withdrawal of new fields of information that has been sought for updating the NPR. “CAA is clearly violating the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, the House resolves to urge upon the government of India to repeal the CAA to avoid any discrimination on the basis of religion in granting citizenship and to ensure equality for all religious groups of India,” said Shanti Dhariwal, parliamentary affairs minister, while moving the resolution. Dhariwal also replied to the allegations of BJP legislators who accused the Congress-led government of appeasement by objecting to the CAA. “My grandmother was travelling to Kota from Bhilwara when she gave birth to my father in a field after experiencing labour pain. So, where should I get the birth certificate of my father?” he questioned. Earlier, participating in the debate, state BJP president Satish Poonia said, “CAA to aapke fufaaji ko bhi laago karna padega (Even your uncle will have to implement CAA).” Responding to it, Dhariwal said, “Humne rajtantra bhi dekha, loktantra bhi dekha, ab sanghtanra dekh rahey hain.” Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria also questioned the right to challenge the Act in the assembly. “Granting citizenship is a matter under the Centre and in such a situation do we have the right to challenge the CAA. The Congress should stop doing appeasement and vote bank politics,” said Kataria, leader of opposition. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 JNU student linked to Shaheen Bagh stir booked for sedition | India News - Times of India,"AGRA/GUWAHATI: UP and Assam police on Saturday booked JNU student Sharjeel Imam for sedition, days after the purported video of a speech he had delivered at Aligarh Muslim University on January 16 against the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC went viral on social media. DIG (Aligarh) Akash Kulhary said Imam, who studied and later taught at IIT Bombay and worked at the University of Copenhagen would be arrested soon. In the video, Imam, a software engineer involved with the Shaheen Bagh protests in the early days, can be heard saying if he can organise 5 lakh people, it would be possible to “permanently cut off Assam with rest of India...if not permanently, then at least for a few months... only then will the government hear our voice”. Assam cops also file FIR against studentIt is unfair to associate our voice with any distorted media narrative... We urge everyone to not be influenced by ...claims made of representing this non-partisan citizen’s movement,” the women of Shaheen Bagh tweeted. Imam, who is from Patna and now lives in Delhi, studies modern Indian history at JNU and was a computer science postgraduate at IIT Bombay where he was later a teaching assistant. He did his schooling from DPS Vasant Kunj in Delhi and worked as IT programmer at the University of Copenhagen before coming to JNU. He has been booked under sections 124 A (sedition), 153 A (provocation with intent to cause riots), 153 B (causing disharmony) and 505 (2) of the IPC at the Civil Lines police station. DIG (Aligarh) Akash Kulhary said, “During investigations, it was found that the purported video, in which the suspect made some anti-national statements, was shot on the AMU campus when he was addressing protesting students.” The Assam Police also filed an FIR against Imam under similar charges. In the video, Imam is further heard saying: “The model of the Shaheen Bagh protest is that of road blockade, rest is secondary. Understand the difference between chakka jam and dharna. Protest in every city, tell the people about chakka jam, prepare and then sit on national highways.” BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra shared the video on Twitter and later at a press conference, organised at the party’s headquarters in Delhi, slammed Imam. He first said Imam’s speech was made at Shaheen Bagh but later when it became clear that it was at AMU, Patra said the new fact did not make the issue “less grave”. BJP dubbed it an “open call for jihad and finishing the sovereignty of the country”. Later, the women of Shaheen Bagh said on their official Twitter account, “No one person, whether Sharjeel Imam or someone else, can be termed as the sole organiser of the protest. It has been led by the women of Shaheen Bagh.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Youth Cong members driven out from Fadnavis CAA talk venue | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Nagpur: A group of 10 to 15 people, allegedly from city Youth Congress unit, on Saturday evening were stopped and evicted from the venue where leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was delivering a talk on ‘Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)’. The talk organized under the Late Manoramabai Mundle Lecture Series by Dharampeth Education Society at Dharampeth Kanya School Ground on North Ambazari Road, witnessed attendance of mainly right-wing activists, citizens and RSS ideologue MG Vaidya. The Youth Congress activists alleged that around 30 to 40 Bharatiya Janat Yuva Morcha (BJYM) activists didn’t allow them to enter the venue though they had only come to listen to the ex-CM. BJYM activists, led by city president Shivani Dani, said they had no objection to anyone attending the event but suspected the Youth Congress activists from South-West constituency would disrupt Fadnavis’s lecture. “They were about to raise slogans. We told them to do it outside,” Dani told TOI. Around six youths were rounded up and taken to Bajaj Nagar police station where cops recorded their names and addresses before releasing them. They were detained after they accused the organizers and cops of not letting them listen to the talk and started raising ‘Youth Congress Zindabad’ slogans. In the speech, which went for over an hour, the MLA from South-West Constituency accused the mainstream political parties of spreading canards and attempting to create anarchy in the country. “India is marching towards $5 trillion economy under Modiji but these parties want to stall the progress. This will only benefit the enemies of India,” said Fadnavis. The former CM reiterated the Sangh Parivar’s rhetoric on CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC). Fadnavis said while the CAA was meant to give citizenship and not take it away from anyone, there was no plan to implement NRC across the country by the Modi government. “Some parties are instilling fears in the minds of minorities, especially Muslims, that they would be sent to Pakistan or thrown out of the country. False news and social media propaganda are running. Every day a new list of documents are circulated asking Muslims and others to search them. This is not true. Not every social media post is genuine,” he said, referring to the one where a purport ‘New Constitution Draft’ allegedly by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat went viral. At the same time, Fadnavis said there are two sets of people who need to be differentiated while considering for citizenship. “One is those who came here after being persecuted while the other came in search of employment but indulged in unlawful activities. There is talk of giving citizenship to not just Hindus from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan but also the second lot which has been found indulging in terrorism actives,” he said.

"R-Day CAA dissent blooms, mayor calls for ordered stir | Kolkata News - Times of India","Kolkata: On Republic Day eve, anti-CAA protesters in Kolkata and Howrah went about their preparations for the D-Day when they will join a human chain in the first half and participate in cultural functions reflecting the Freedom struggle in the second. However, police have not given permission for the human chain as they do not want the general public to be inconvenienced by traffic restrictions. Mayor Firhad Hakim, too, expressed concern over attempts to block roads to protest against NRC and CAA. He instead called for a united voice from a single platform that would register a stronger protest. “This is not the right approach. If somebody has to register his/her protests against NRC or CAA, they are welcome to join our platform. Our CM has been relentlessly airing her grievance against the anti-people policies adopted by the Centre,” Hakim said. On Saturday afternoon, cops stepped in at the protest site near New Market and forced the protesters who have been squatting right in the middle of the road to shift the platform to a corner. Later, the deputy commissioner of the central division held a meeting with OCs of Burrabazar, Posta, Maidan and New Market police stations to chalk out a plan to prevent activists from blocking roads to hold agitations. The agitators on Hogg Street vowed to carry on with the protests for at least four days more. At Park Circus, the protests in the Maidan entered the 12th day on Saturday and showed no signs of abating. The participants there and at Ekbalpore, Zakaria Street and Howrah’s Pilkhana are eager to usher in Republic Day with flag hoisting in the morning and then travel to the nearest point between Golpark and Shyambazar to join the human chain. “The human chain is an innovative idea to send out a message that we are united in our fight against the draconian CAA and the proposed NRC and NPR,” said Irfan Ali Taj, one of the organizers of the sit-in at Zakaria Street. At Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore, protesters plan to bring out a peace rally in the evening that will have participation from people of all faiths. “We want a dialogue with every section of the society. It is important that the right message is sent out that it is not any particular community but the Constitution which is being threatened,” said Arshad Parvez Khan, one of the organizers. At Howrah’s Pilkahana, members of the civil society are invited to speak on CAA and NRC to the gathering in the evening. “People should have a clear idea what they are protesting against. This is why we are organising awareness camps almost on a daily basis,” said one of the organizers. At Park Circus Maidan, where the sit-in started on January 7, cultural programmes are scheduled in the evening. “Several students, artists and intellectuals are expected to arrive in the evening. We are going to sing patriotic songs and make posters,” said one of the organizers. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

‘CAA may put national security under threat’ | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Along with Delhi and rest of the country, the state’s second capital is also witnessing large-scale protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Leading the charge are primarily the youngsters, besides Muslims — most of whom believe that the new legislation targets their community. However, many are unaware of the minutiae of the amended law, according to noted lawyer Firdos Mirza. An expert in matters pertaining to the Constitution, Mirza says that the law is not only discriminatory towards Muslims, but works against all citizens who do not have “valid” documents to prove their place of birth. In an exclusive tête-à-tête with TOI, he tries to correct many misconceptions about the new legislation. Excerpts... Q. Please explain CAA. A. The law prescribes grant of citizenship to illegal migrants belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who entered India on or before December 31, 2014, without any verification. Q. Which documents are required to prove citizenship? A. If the media is to be believed, documents like Aadhaar, voter ID, PAN card or passport would not be sufficient for proving citizenship. However, there is no clarity on the documents (apart from the birth certificate) actually required to prove that someone is an Indian citizen. A UNICEF report states that only 58% births are registered in India, which means that the remaining 42% go undocumented every year. Q. It is perceived that CAA is against the Muslim community. A. Not only Muslims, the law is against the entire country; and its implementation may put national security under threat. Its provision of granting citizenship to those from neighbouring countries threatens national security, as the entry of undesired elements cannot be ruled out. Even hardened criminals and terrorists can become citizens of India and pose dangers to the nation’s peace and tranquillity. Q. Why are Muslims agitated? A. Muslims are the most law-abiding citizens of India. The spirit of Indian Constitution is brotherhood, equality and justice; but the linking of religion to citizenship in CAA breaches that spirit. The community considers it a direct assault on the constitutional set-up of the country, which may have far-reaching repercussions. Right now, the Act is leading to religious discrimination against the five lakh Muslims who were left out in NRC in Assam. Since everyone needs to get registered under NRC, the onus of proving that they are not foreigners will fall on all individuals. This entire exercise could lead to a huge humanitarian crisis. Q. There is a lot of talk about National Population Register (NPR). A. The Citizenship Act, 1955, does not prescribe the preparation of NPR or any such register by the central government. The reference to the population register is made through a subordinate legislation, i.e. the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. Q. How are NPR and NRC related? A. Both are part of same process. NPR contains details of persons residing in various parts of India, and is prepared by collecting information related to them by the local registrar. For NRC, the local registrars need to verify and scrutinize the information collected in NPR. It would be on their discretion to declare any citizen as dubious. Such persons then need to satisfy the taluka registrar or sub-district registrar about them being Indian citizens. Thereafter, a draft NRC would be registered, inviting objections on the inclusion of any name. After consideration of such objections, the NRC would be published. Those who are left out could make an appeal to the district registrar, whose order would be final. Q. There are speculations that orphans would suffer the most after CAA and NRC. A. Section 3 of Citizenship Act deals with ‘Citizenship by Birth’. Accordingly, if CAA is implemented, then the children born to illegal migrants belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before December 31, 2014, would be Indian citizens. Children born after December 3, 2004 to Muslim parents, and to all others after December 31, 2014 whose parent(s) fail to prove their citizenship would not be treated as Indian citizens, and would be deemed as stateless persons born in India with no other country to go to. Orphans would suffer the same fate, as they would not be able to prove who their parents are. Q. What about transgenders, destitutes, homeless and aged people, sannyasis, monks and persons with mentally disabilities? A. Only if they have a record of their parents, would they be treated as Indian citizens. Q. Isn’t NRC good, as the country would have a list of all citizens and infiltrators would be filtered out? A. NRC was introduced in Assam upon allegations of demographical changes, based on a survey. It stated that the 1 crore infiltrators staying there were converting the state’s ethnic population into a minority. After a gigantic exercise by 52,000 officials for around eight years, at the cost of over Rs1,600 crore, only 19 lakh persons were identified to not be a part of NRC, and of them only around five lakh are Muslims. Even family members of most of the five lakh people are included in NRC. By implementing CAA, the illegal migrants would be granted citizenship based on their religion. Later, through NRC, all the existing residents would be forced to prove their citizenship by submitting documents while standing in serpentine queues, and thereafter through appeals and finally, facing the foreign tribunals. The road ultimately ends at detention camps. Is the problem of illegal migrants so gigantic that we are making every Indian stand in a queue? Q. Why are people talking about detention centres? A. In CAA, a reference has been made to the British-made law ‘The Foreigners Act, 1946’, which is made applicable to the entire country, except Assam. This Act provides for detention of those who are found to be foreigners, until they are themselves able to prove that they are not. Till that time, they would be placed in detention centres. Once a person is declared to not be a citizen of India, s/he loses rights under the Constitution and other laws, including voting rights. Q. Why are minorities opposing CAA when it is meant to provide justice to the persecuted minorities? A. CAA nowhere mentions the word ‘persecution’, nor does it elaborate what is meant by it. There is no data available or case reported to be pending in international courts about the persecution of minorities. The proven persecution is of Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka and Rohingya Hindus in Myanmar, but they are conspicuously left out for no reason. The Ahmadiyya community and Shias of Indian origin are two of the most persecuted minorities in Pakistan, and they are also left out. This Act seems to be malicious, and prima facie contrary to the provisions of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India — which guarantee equality before law and right to life.

Left parties form human chain against CAA | Patna News - Times of India,"PATNA: The five-party Left combine on Saturday formed one-hour human chain at Patna and the district headquarters in the state demanding withdrawal of Citizenship (Amendment Act (CAA) and opposing proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR). They claimed that once implemented, these issues would deprive crores of people of citizenship rights, besides causing incalculable harassment and monetary loss to all in mustering proofs to get the citizenship rights. The representatives of Congress, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) also joined the human chain organized formed from Buddha Smriti Park to Gandhi Maidan in Patna. CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, CPI state secretary Satya Narayan Singh, CPM secretariat member Sarvoday Sharma, CPM senior Subhashini Ali and senior functionaries of the Forward Bloc and Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) joined the human chain at Patna. Groups of people also took out processions in various localities of Patna. Bhattacharya said the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre first wanted to create Hindu-Muslim divide in the country through CAA, NRC and NPR, but the Centre’s policy moves on citizenship have evoked widespread protests from people across the country. “The most sinister part of the new citizenship determination exercise is that the official concerned would have the discretion to mark the application with “Doubtful or D” having perused the documentary proofs submitted. In that case, the person would eventually be put in detention camps, which have been constructed in Assam and were in the process of being newly built in all the states. Or the existing jails would be treated as detention camps,” Dipankar said. The human chain was also supported by the Imarat-e-Shariah, a religious body of Muslims of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. Various other religious groups, including All India Milli Council (AIMC), Jammat-e-Islami and All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat also participated in the human chain formation. Maulana Shibli Qasmi, the general secretary of Imarat-e-Shariah, said, “In the past, several governments had taken wrong decisions but after public opinion, they also made amends. The government need to realize their mistake and should revoke the law. Such laws do not make the country, rather it breaks the democratic fabric.” AIMC vice-president Maulana Anisur Rahman Qasmi said, “By making citizenship law, the Centre is targeting the underprivileged, Dalits and Muslims. How the poor people will produce the required papers, and if they failed to produce the papers their citizenship will be in question.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Now 'tranquilise' comment by BJP leader against those who attack party workers | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA/SURI: A BJP district president in West Bengal on Saturday became the latest to join the list of leaders of the saffron party making controversial statements by saying those who attack its workers should be 'tranquilised' and if it fails, they should be 'put to sleep forever'. The comment was made by BJP's Birbhum district president Shyamapada Mandal at a rally at Sainthia held in support of Citizenship Amendment Act during which he attacked the ruling Trinamool Congress for staunchly opposing it. ""You have seen how rogue elephants are dealt with. At first efforts are made to tranquilise them but if it doesn't work, they are killed by using injections. Similarly, those attacking BJP workers should be first administered tranquilisers. If that does not work, the attackers should be put to sleep forever"", Mondal said. His comment follows that of state party president Dilip Ghosh, who is known to often court controversy, had said on January 12 that those who are involved in damaging public property should be ""shot at and killed like the same way in Uttar Pradesh"". Ghosh had came down heavily on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at a public meeting ""for not opening fire and ordering lathi-charge"" on those destroying railway property and public transport during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in the state in December last year. Reacting to Mondal's comments, Trinamool Congress leader Chandrima Bhattacharya said that what the BJP leader had said is ""not at all surprising"". ""He is not saying anything surprising. The state BJP president Dilip Ghosh had also spoken in the same tone and tenor. Ghosh has been recently elected the state BJP president for the second time. Maybe Mondal is harbouring the aspiration of becoming the state BJP chief and that is why he spoke that way"", she quipped. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Punjab 'bandh' called by radical Sikh outfit gets lukewarm response | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: The one-day 'Punjab bandh' call given by radical Sikh outfit Dal Khalsa and SAD (Amritsar) against the CAA and the NRC evoked lukewarm response in most parts of the state barring Amritsar. Markets and commercial establishments remained opened in most parts of the state as protesters at a few places faced opposition from shopkeepers for trying to forcibly down the shutters of their shops. Protesters carrying black flags and placards against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) took out protest marches and raised slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre. The impact of the shutdown call was visible in Amritsar as traders kept their shops and commercial establishments shut. The protest remained peaceful, officials said.

Terming the law as ""divisive and discriminative"", Kanwar Pal Singh said accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah of ""suppressing"" the voices of protesters ""We are determined to contest and challenge the government's autocratic attitude,"" he said.

 Media bodies condemn attack on journalist at Shaheen Bagh | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Media bodies on Saturday condemned the alleged attack on News Nation consulting editor Deepak Chaurasia by protesters at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh and demanded police action against perpetrators of the violence. In a statement, the News Broadcasters Federation (NBF) said it is extremely concerned about the repeated instances of violence directed at journalists in the line of duty at Shaheen Bagh. The Indian Women's Press Corps, in a statement, said it unequivocally condemns the use of physical force against all journalists and stands in solidarity with them. These attacks have been fuelled by a growing spirit of intolerance by those claiming to be protestors at Shaheen Bagh, NBF president Arnab Goswami said in a statement. ""The most recent attack on senior journalist Deepak Chaurasia and his camera crew at Shaheen Bagh, which was recorded on camera, reflects the growing hostility of some of those at Shaheen Bagh towards journalists unwilling to toe their line,"" he said. In recent weeks there have been similar attacks on several other TV journalists in the course of which camera equipment has been broken and destroyed and some journalists, including those who were victims of Friday's attack, have had to be hospitalised, Goswami said. The NBF, which is the largest such organisation of news broadcasters pan India, demands immediate police action against those who have perpetrated the violence and seeks solidarity among all members of the Indian media against this relentless attack on reporters, and editors of news media organisations, he said. Police said Chaurasia, 51, complained to them saying he was beaten up and his camera was snatched by a mob at the protest site. An FIR has been registered under sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and 34 (common intention) against unknown persons at the Shaheen Bagh police station, a senior police officer said. The IWPC said it notes with deep distress and concern the Friday violence against the group of journalists by a section of people protesting at Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi. Chaurasia, Doordarshan reporter Nitendra Singh and their team of camera persons were manhandled by a group of protesters at the site and physically prevented from discharging their journalistic duties, it said. A Times of India photo journalist was also reportedly threatened by some protesters while he was taking shots around the location of the agitation, the IWPC said. Such attacks compromise and gravely undermine the media's constitutionally and legally guaranteed rights to gather and disseminate information, it said. Violence and use of force against journalists undermine media freedom and needs to be condemned in the strongest terms by one and all, it added. On his Twitter handle, Chaurasia uploaded a one-minute video in which he was seen surrounded by protestors and later manhandled by them. They tried to remove him from the spot and also snatched his microphone. In another part of the video, a group of men can be seen trying to snatch a camera from the cameraman.

‘In bad taste’: Sumitra Mahajan on BJP neta’s crude remark | Indore News - Times of India,"INDORE: BJP seems divided on its reaction to party leader Badrilal Yadav’s controversial comment on Rajgarh collector Nidhi Nivedita, with former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan saying it was in bad taste, but state party chief Rakesh Singh finding nothing wrong in Yadav’s words. Mahajan, who was taking part in BJP’s protest against alleged bias in the statewide anti-mafia crackdown, told TOI that Yadav’s statements were targeted at an individual, hence unwelcome. “I don’t like any such statement. It is in bad taste. I have never spoken anything wrong against any individual. The fight should be on rules and policies. No one should make personal comments. However, what went wrong there (the collector slapping BJP workers at a pro-CAA rally on January 19) should be condemned,” she said. Rakesh Singh, however, defended Yadav. “If the statement was inappropriate and was meant to be wrong, I would have been the first person to act against him (Yadav). He was referring to a mother feeding her child in her lap with a bowl/spoon. The intention wasn’t wrong,” he said. The state BJP president claimed that Yadav’s statements were misconstrued. “It’s an attempt to divert the issue in planned manner,” he said. Singh was present when Yadav made the crude remarks on the collector at a protest rally in Biaora on January 22. The rally had been organised to protest against the collector for slapping BJP workers, but Yadav’s comment overshadowed it and led Congress to liken state BJP leaders to the Kauravas. PCC media cell coordinator Narendra Saluja criticized Rakesh Singh for backing Yadav’s statement. “The state BJP president is endorsing Badrilal Yadav’s statement. How much does BJP respect women? If you are giving the female officer the status of mother, they why are you creating a ruckus when the ‘mother’ gives a slap?” he tweeted. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

West Bengal: Anti-CAA protests stir up kitchen revolution | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on the streets have brought about a mini-revolution in several homes where stereotyped gender roles have turned upside down. With women occupying the streets, men have found themselves tending to chores like baby-sitting, doing laundry, dropping and fetching kids from school and even rustling up a snack in the kitchen. Many confided how earlier the same work was done by the womenfolk of the house only while the male members focussed on their businesses or jobs. Cooking, cleaning and washing are survival skills and not aligned to any particular gender. From the earliest signs of discontent against CAA and NRC at the turn of the year, it was clear that stereotypical images of women as subservient and generally indoors were set to change. From simple homemakers to college goers, from professors to doctors, women have been at the forefront of the uprising, forcing even the biggest proponents of the CAA within the BJP to tread cautiously. Businessman Wasi Akhtar admits he is performing the role of both parents for his four daughters while his wife is attending the protests at Park Circus Maidan. One of his main duties is to ready his daughters and drop them at school in the morning as his wife, who returns late from Park Circus, is too tired. He returns home early in the evening to watch over the kids while his wife leaves for Park Circus. “Earlier, I hardly contributed to household work. But now I do everything from readying children for school to feeding them and even cooking a snack for them in the evening. I don’t want chores at home to prevent her from being a part of a greater cause,” said the Topsia resident. Some of the most striking images of the protests have been of women marching or delivering speeches, many of them wearing burqas and hijabs and others turning up either in a pair of jeans or sari. Businessman and social worker Manzar Jameel feels the women’s movement challenges patriarchy which the right-wing regimes fear. His wife and daughters have been actively participating in protests and educating others on the nuances of the CAA and NRC and the impact the combination of both can have. “I happily shoulder some of the responsibilities at home,” said Jameel. “Earlier this week she was out for over 6 hours to attend a camp on CAA and in her absence, I did some household chores, purchased groceries and made other arrangements as people were invited at home. My contribution is very little compared to the cause my wife and daughters have associated with,” said Jameel. “My husband has a small business which sustains an eight-member family. I have told him to focus on his business which is important so that we are secured financially. But I have set a condition that he will have to return home early daily and take care of the kids while I am at Park Circus,” said Arshia Shakeel, a homemaker from Shamsul Huda Road in Park Circus. Sheikh Sanaullah accompanies his wife to Park Circus and other protest rallies to take care of their infant daughter. “Our daughter is so small that my wife cannot leave her at home. I decided to accompany her wherever she goes,” said Sanaullah, a resident of Collin Lane near Elliot Road. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

A Trinamool supporter, sources said, is still being treated in a hospital. The officer, Pushpal Bhattacharya, sustained serious injuries in three fingers and had to get seven stitches. The attack on the officer prompted the Lake police to draw up a suo motu FIR on the incident. The Trinamool also submitted a complaint alleging their workers were severely assaulted and some women members were molested. According to sources, the incident took place during BJP’s pro-CAA campaign on Rahim Ostagar Lane. The clashes were triggered after a row between rival party workers when BJP workers passed by a Trinamool party office. The clashes turned violent with a parked bike nearly being set ablaze and around eight persons of either group sustaining injuries. Police said most of these injuries were minor with only one still recuperating in a local hospital. A senior BJP leader said, “The attack was pre-planned. Our supporters were attacked. Some are injured. The police did not accept our complaint and arrested our party workers instead. To protest against this, we gathered at the Lake police station and demonstrated. Police were then forced to accept our complaint.” However, a local Trinamool leader said, “BJP supporters instigated the clash when they were passing by our party office. They assaulted our workers and did not spare the women. We have lodged a police complaint.” Officers said the Lake police station was sealed during the protests and additional forces had been sent there. “The situation is tense, but under control.

Two AMU students booked for ‘using’ children for anti-CAA protest | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: Aligarh police on Friday booked three persons, including two AMU students, for allegedly ‘using’ children during anti-CAA protest march on the university campus on Monday. According to police, AMU students, Mohammad Naeem Khan and Mohammad Asif Khan from Social Science faculty along with an unidentified person have been booked under section 83 of the Juvenile Justice (Care And Protection of Children) Act of 2015, on a complaint filed by sub-inspector Srikant Yadav, who is a child welfare officer.

CAA: Chancellor gheraoed at Maulana Azad National Urdu University | Hyderabad News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: Trouble erupted on Maulana Azad National Urdu University (Manuu) campus, on Friday evening, after a group of students gheraoed chancellor, Firoz Bakht Ahmed’s vehicle, and shouted slogans against him, while he was leaving the premises. The chancellor had taken a police party with him to enter the campus as his own vice-chancellor had advised him against visiting the university. In December, Ahmed issued an appeal urging Muslim community to maintain calm and assuring them that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) would not uproot them from India, where they have been living since time immemorial. “Since then, I have been threatened with dire consequences by students,” the chancellor told TOI. Alleging that the students were instigated by Manuu vice-chancellor Mohammed Aslam Parvaiz, Ahmed said: “It was absolutely peaceful when I came in, earlier in the afternoon. It was only when I stepped out of my quarters to leave, did these students gather near the gate. It is certainly the handiwork of the V-C and registrar.” The tussle between the two administrative heads of India’s only Urdu university has been going on for a long time now, with both accusing each other of fraudulent practices, on public platforms. In November last year, Parvaiz even tendered his resignation to the President attributing it to continuous harassment by Ahmed who claimed that the V-C decided to quit to avoid inquiry into his actions, including charges of sexual harassment. When contacted, the V-C confirmed that he had asked the chancellor to stay away from the campus. “That is because I knew something like this could happen… Why did he unnecessarily need to come to the university and disturb the peace? Students have finally settled down and concentrating on their academics. There was no need for him to rake up the issue again,” said Parvaiz. He said the Chancellor had to be escorted out through back door to avoid further trouble. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Citizens pledge not to give details for NPR at Church-backed public meet | Goa News - Times of India,"MARGAO: The anti-CAA protest meeting organised by the Council for Social Justice and Peace, an arm of the Goa Church, and Concerned Citizens of Goa demanded that the state legislative assembly pass a resolution demanding the central government unconditionally and immediately revoke the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and all activities related to National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). The gathering also pledged “to refuse to provide details for the NPR”. Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao and Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro, were among those seated in the front rows but did not address the gathering. Prominent among those who addressed the meeting included Damodar Mauzo, Oscar Rebello, Francisco Colaco and Prabhakar Timble. Rebello referred to the Indian Constitution as every citizen’s holy book which enshrined values of justice, equality, fraternity and peace. “It is because the government has attempted to defile their holy book that people have taken to the streets,” he said. Stating that the NRC was “more dangerous” than the CAA, Rebello said that NRC would provide a tool to the corrupt bureaucrats “to bribe you to include your name in the registry.” Mauzo said that the CAA was an attempt to breach the Constitution and, in effect, destroy the social fabric of Goan society. “We are worried that this will end up in second partition of India,” he said. Timble said that India will be the only country where citizenship is granted on the basis of religion if CAA is implemented. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Pavan Varma’s letter has no value, won’t respond: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar | Patna News - Times of India","PATNA: A day after telling senior JD(U) functionary Pavan Varma that “he was free to leave”, chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday made it clear that he will not respond to Varma’s letter in which he had raised questions about JD (U)’s alliance with BJP for Delhi polls. “If a person is in the party and writes a letter and hands it over properly then the question of a response arises. Is this a letter? You send an email and then release it to the press, this has no value,” Nitish said. He, however, refused to answer questions from mediapersons on whether any action will be taken against Varma. Despite Nitish’s curt statement on Friday, Varma told TOI that he will still wait for a response from the party chief on the issues raised by him. “Whether the honourable CM responds to my letter is up to him. But he must respond to the issues I raised as those are important not only for the party but also for the country. I will wait for a response and decide my future course accordingly,” Varma said. When asked about Nitish’s objection to the way the letter was circulated, Varma said, “I had spoken to him but my advice was not accepted, then I was left with no choice but to raise the issues on a public platform.” He added, “An e-mail sent to his official ID is a formal method of communication.” On whether Nitish’s comments hint at the possibility that he does not consider the former IFS officer as part of JD (U) anymore, Varma said, “I am grateful to Nitish Ji for putting faith in me by making me a general secretary and sending me to Rajya Sabha. It is this faith that made me ask fundamental questions concerning the party. Anybody else may have left, but I chose to remain and raise the issues.” Senior JD (U) functionary and Bihar water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha launched a veiled attack on Varma as well as Prashant Kishor, who has also been publicly opposing the CAA and the NRC. “JD(U) symbolises the struggle of the socially and economically marginalised and their hope for a better future under Nitish Kumar’s leadership. Selfish careerists who abused his trust and party’s hospitality, and are now conspiring to damage us, will never succeed,” Jha tweeted on Friday. Kishore, whose views have been identical to Varma’s on CAA and NRC, refused to comment on Nitish’s reaction to Varma’s letter. “If Nitish Kumar is now hinting that Varma is not a party member anymore then he is questioning his own decision of making him general secretary and sending him to Rajya Sabha. As far as Prashant is concerned, he has already tendered his resignation thrice, but it was not accepted,” a senior JD (U) functionary said, wishing anonymity.

Lucknow University may add CAA in curriculum | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Nationwide protests against the amended citizenship law have apparently prompted Lucknow University's political science department to consider a proposal to include Citizenship Amendment Act in its curriculum. The university had recently included Article 370 and 'refugees' as topics under the 'Contemporary Issues in Indian Politics' paper. Talking to TOI, head of the political science department, Shashi Shukla, said, the proposal was being discussed and would have to be sent to the board of studies for approval. ""CAA is a contemporary issue and can be taught for the paper on 'Contemporary Issues in Indian Politics'. Since everyone, including students, is talking about it, we thought it could be part the syllabus,"" she said.  The topic has been discussed by the faculty and there has been a consensus to forward the proposal to the board of studies for clearance. Thereafter, it will be sent to the faculty board and later to the academic council for final approval. If cleared, CAA would be in the curriculum by next year, said Shukla.  Clarifying there was no recommendation to include CAA in the syllabus from the ministry of human resource development or the state government, she said the department was considering it as a contemporary political issue.  While the matter is still in the proposal stage, BSP chief Mayawati hit out at Lucknow University, claiming it had already included in the syllabus. The former UP chief minister tweeted - A debate on CAA is all right, but when the matter is in court, the Lucknow University's decision to introduce it in the curriculum is divisive, condemnable and inappropriate. BSP promises that when it returns to power, it will roll back the decision."" On Tuesday, Union home minister Amit Shah had challenged Opposition party leaders to a debate on CAA.

At a meeting of district presidents and observers at Trinamool Bhavan, chief minister Mamata Banerjee asked the district leadership to go to every house and convince people against the new citizenship law. At a press conference after the meeting, TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said: “On February 1 and 2, we will organise rallies and public meetings at the block level. On February 5, there will be a human chain throughout the state between 2pm and 3pm, followed by a silent protest with posters against NRC, NPR and CAA on February 6.

The CM will conduct three public meetings: one in Bongaon, one in the Kalyani-Chakdah-Gayeshpur assembly constituencies and one in Rampurhat subdivision. “The date and place have not been finalised yet. We will speak with the chief minister and finalise the date and place,” Chatterjee added. The Trinamool veteran alleged that BJP has been indulging in atrocities against TMC workers. “Our member, Bhaskar Banerjee, is on death bed and many more are injured. In the protest, we will organise a public meeting at Anandapur ground on February 1,” he said. There have been some minor changes in the party rank and file.

"Advocate lashes out at those opposing CAA, calls them ‘pseudo-secularists’ | Hubballi News - Times of India","Dharwad: Against a backdrop of unrelenting opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act across the country, advocate Anup Deshpande sought to offer a contrarian perspective on the controversial law on Thursday. “CAA has been introduced in order to accord citizenship to those who have been fleeing due to religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. There are no provisions in the law that needs to make people think that their Indian citizenship is in peril,” said Deshpande. The advocate, participating in a symposium organised by the Gandhi Peace Foundation on CAA, lashed out at those opposing the Act. Dubbing critics of the Act ‘pseudo-secularists’, Deshpande said, “These are people acting out of ulterior motives and creating confusion about the objectives of the CAA. Gullible citizens are being incited to protest against the Centre. Those opposing the Act are either ignorant of its provisions or deliberately indulging in a campaign of misinformation to further their ends.” Quoting Mahatma Gandhi on the subject, Desphande said that the former too had expressed a wish to accord citizenship to those willing to come to India. “He had wanted such people to enjoy a decent, dignified life here. After Partition, Pakistan declared itself as an Islamic Republic, and members belonging to minority communities such as Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis were subjected to persecution. The BJP-led NDA government is doing what the previous Congress-led governments failed to by providing justice to these people,” said the advocate. ‘No rules yet on NRC’ Deshpande pointed out that the central government was yet to frame rules or guidelines for the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and urged people not to fear such a prospect. “The NRC was rolled out in Assam, but will not be implemented across the country. The government will not ask citizens to furnish documents to prove their citizenship, but rumours are being spread to create confusion among the public,” he added. Siddangouda Patil, however, sought to contradict the observations made by Deshpande. “Those coming to India from neighbouring countries are not fleeing due to religious persecution, but running away because of gross violations of human rights. They are not infiltrators. People coming to India in search of better prospects are being projected as infiltrators. There have already been reports of tents of such people in Bengaluru being demolished. They are now unemployed, and have no roof over their heads, and being left to starve,” said Patil. He urged the government to step up efforts to identify the real infiltrators. “They are the ones who must be sent to detention centres,” said Patil, questioning the haste with which the CAA was passed in mere three days without a careful consideration of its alignment with the values of the Constitution. “Had this Act been discussed in the public domain, we would not have witnessed such public outcry against it,” he said.

‘Mahatma would have stood with students against CAA’ | Jaipur News - Times of India,"There are hundreds of students sitting in protests against CAA and standing up for Hindu Muslim unity today. If Gandhiji was here, he would have been sitting with the students, said activist Ruchira Gupta as she opened a session on the Father of the Nation at the Jaipur Literature Festival on Friday. Gupta, along with writer Makarand Paranjape, filmmaker Ramesh Sharma and historian Talat Ahmed were discussing the relevance of Gandhi in current times. “Gandhi has remained incredibly influential particularly in relation with bringing about social change. Other leaders, including Marx, Lenin and Che Guevara have been tainted with their support of violence. But Gandhi stuck to his idea of non-violence,” said Ahmed, adding that his ideas find resonance in young people. “Several movements across the world, including the extinction rebellion in the UK, have been inspired by the civil disobedience movement that Gandhi led. Even after 70 years of his death, he remains relevant,” she said. Paranjape, while agreeing with her in principle, added that Gandhi’s “afterlife is greater than his life.” The panelists also deconstructed Gandhi’s life and assassination, obliquely touched upon the rise of right-wing fundamentalism in India, criticised attempts to “rewrite” history, and called out the whitewashing of certain groups, including the RSS. Through the hour-long session, the panel discussed and debated, agreed at times, but also often differed in their opinions, especially when it came to contextualizing and placing Gandhi in the present political scenario. But they also concurred that Gandhi’s legacy would withstand the tests of time. Responding to a question about how Gandhi would respond to Prime Minister Modi, Sharma said he would likely go on an “indefinite fast”. “Modi would join that fast,” quipped in Paranjape amid audience cheers, but Gupta was ready with a comeback. “The PM still has an option to join protestors at Shaheen Bagh,” she said, while referring to a neighbourhood in south-east Delhi, which has become the face of the protests against CAA and NRC, with women of all ages staging a 24*7 sit-in. But amid dissenting voices, which the panelists said Gandhi stood for, they also reached a consensus about what the young can back take from him. “If the young had to learn one thing from Gandhi, it should be sustainability. They can learn how to keep movements alive by showing the world not just what they are standing for, but also what they are against,” said Gupta.

CAA resolution in House today | Jaipur News - Times of India,"Jaipur: The resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will be taken up in the assembly on Saturday. The current session is likely to be a two-day affair as the budget session will begin only after the Union budget. The ruling Congress has decided to bring a resolution expressing its disapproval of the contentious legislation by the Centre as CAA passed by Parliament is discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional. The Congress argued that there is no provision in the Constitution to grant citizenship based on religion. However, it likely to be acrimonious as the opposition BJP already made it clear that bringing such a resolution was uncalled for as the Supreme Court is already seized of the matter. The apex court will decide the legislation’s legality not assembly, argued the opposition. The assembly also must ratify the Constitution (126th) Amendment extending reservation to SC and ST in Lok Sabha and state assemblies for another 10 years on Saturday. On Friday, the amendment was tabled in the House by the assembly secretary. The house will also take up the Rajasthan Krishi Upaj Mandhi (amendment) Ordinance 2019, Rajasthan Jan Aadhaar Authority Ordinance and Rajasthan Goods and Services Taxes (amendment) Ordinance, which were tabled in the house on Friday.

Anti-CAA protesters block Theni MP’s vehicle | Madurai News - Times of India,"Madurai: A group of anti-CAA protesters gheraoed the vehicle of Theni MP O P Ravindranath Kumar in Cumbum late on Thursday night showing their opposition against their MP for voting in favour of the act in the parliament. According to police sources, Ravindranath Kumar took part in a public meeting organized at Cumbum in connection with MGR’s birthday celebration. A group of protesters, mostly Muslims, had gathered in a road in Cumbum and awaited the MP’s return to show black flags.

" CAA effect? Number of Bangladeshi illegals exiting up, says BSF | India News - Times of India","KOLKATA: The number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants trying to exit India through the porous land border has “increased substantially”, though it can’t be called an “exodus” as of now, according to the Border Security Force. BSF troops along the 913-km south Bengal frontier apprehended 268 Bangladeshi nationals — nearly 90% of them going back to Bangladesh from India — in the first 23 days of 2020, BSF inspector-general (South Bengal Frontier) Y B Khurania said in Kolkata on Friday. Most of them used the international border in North 24 Parganas’ Ghojadanga, he added. Prodded by journalists whether this rise could be attributed to the new citizenship law, Khurania said that might be the case. “We believe that it is because of our increased vigil that fewer people from Bangladesh are trying to illegally enter India. Most of those without valid documents apprehended by us near the border were on their way out. But there seems to be no exodus-like situation,” Khurania said. “We apprehended 1,677 Bangladeshis without valid papers in 2018 (or a daily average of 4.5) and 2,194 in 2019 (or a daily average of 6) and most of them were India-bound. But, in 2020, we have already apprehended 268 Bangladeshis (almost 12 daily) and 90% of them were returning to Bangladesh,” he added. Officials said all these figures pertained to only the 913-km south Bengal frontier (about a fourth of the total length of the India-Bangladesh border). Fewer people may have actually tried to cross over into India from Bangladesh illegally fearing detection by agencies after the passage of the CAA, they said.

 Vijayvargiya's 'poha' remark exposes BJP's real intent on NPR: Congress | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday said BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya's ""poha"" remark exposes the Modi government's real intent on the National Population Register (NPR) as it has been made deliberately to instill fears in the minds of people and profile them on the basis of food habits. Congress leader Sushmita Dev termed Vijayvargiya's statement as irresponsible and condemnable and demanded that Vijayvargiya apologise for it. She also said that the BJP leadership's silence on his statement is unfortunate.

""The statement exposes the real intent of the BJP on the NPR ... This is the reason why we are saying that this government will use NPR for profiling people.

The country is in turmoil on many issues and this is the statement which has been deliberately made to instill fear among the common man,"" she told reporters. ""He should apologise to the nation and the BJP, which at the drop of a hat holds a press meet on irrelevant issues to divert the attention of the nation, should hold a press meet and apologise for this statement. It should clarify and retract this statement because this is condemnable. ""It is very unfortunate that the BJP is silent on this issue, which means that he might be instructed to talk in this manner and the top leadership of the BJP is definitely complicit in this,"" the Congress leader said. Dev said the Congress has consistently been saying that the poor will suffer and this statement of Vijayvargiya further ""reiterates what we are saying because he is after all pointing out a finger at the person who is a basic construction site worker"". ""We condemn his statement and we reiterate our concern about the manner in which this government is likely to conduct the NPR in the country by profiling people on different basis which should not be the criteria in NPR process,"" she said. Dev said Vijayvargiya is a senior BJP leader who has reportedly made some remarks about construction workers who were working at his residence and has connected the food of the construction worker to his nationality and called them infiltrators. ""If a responsible senior leader of the BJP like Mr. Vijayvargiya can today declare someone as a foreign infiltrator because he or she is having 'poha', as being reported, if you can profile a census on nationality and connected to national security, this is the reason why we are saying that this government will use NPR for profiling people,"" she claimed. To a question on whether he should give a statement, she said Kailash Vijayvargiya is a senior general secretary of the BJP and in-charge of West Bengal and a statement coming from such a senior leader, is actually creating fear in the minds of the people, instilling fears in the mind of the people. Vijayvargiya on Thursday said in Indore that he suspected that there were some Bangladeshis among construction labourers who worked at his house recently. Their ""strange"" eating habits aroused suspicion about their nationality, the BJP general secretary said at a seminar in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) here. When a new room was being added at his house recently, he found ""eating habits"" of some of the workers ""strange"" as ""they were eating only 'poha' (flattened rice)"", he said. When reporters questioned him later, Vijayvargiya said, ""I suspected these workers were residents of Bangladesh. Two days after I became suspicious, they stopped working at my house. ""I have not filed any police complaint yet. I only mentioned this incident to warn people,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Pavan Varma's letter has no meaning, says Nitish Kumar | India News - Times of India","PATNA: In a fresh snub to disgruntled JD(U) leader Pavan Varma, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday said the letter from the former career diplomat- turned-politician had ""no value"" and ""no meaning"" and hence did not deserve a reply. Kumar made the remarks here in reply to a query from journalists who had approached him with queries about Varma's stance after the JD(U) chief rebuffed the national general secretary that he would take a decision about his continuance in the party after receiving a ""reply"" from the chief minister. ""When a member of the party sends a proper communication, it is replied to. Do you call it a letter? An email sent and the contents shared thereafter with the media. It has no meaning and no value"", Kumar said on the sidelines of a function to mark birth anniversary of Karpoori Thakura former chief minister whom he considers as his political ideologue. Varma, who resigned from the IFS in 2013 to take up the role of Kumar's culture adviser and enjoyed a two-year tenure in the Rajya Sabha subsequently, has been critical of the party's support to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The differences, however, seem to have become irreconcilable ever since he shared screenshots of a two-page letter written to Kumar earlier this week, questioning the party's decision to contest the Delhi assembly polls in alliance with BJP. Varma had cited the example of another NDA ally Shiromani Akali Dal which decided to stay away from Delhi elections following the BJP's refusal to heed the demand for bringing Muslims under the ambit of CAA and wondered why the JD(U) was contesting in alliance with the saffron party, which was under attack from protesters across the country. The former IFS officer, who is a well-known columnist and writer, had also ended up making public through the letter shared on social media details of conversations he claimed to have had with Kumar ""in private"". The conversations, he claimed, included the chief minister's unease with the BJPs ""divisive"" agenda, which led him to part ways in 2013 and persisted after his return to the NDA in 2017. He had also claimed that Kumar had once told him that he was ""humiliated"" by the BJP's ""current leadership"" and asked an unnamed ""senior party official"" to work on regrouping socialist and democratic forces against the saffron party.

The programme aims to target 30 lakh people across the nation. Students’ leader Salman Imtiaz, who is former president of Students’ Union, said that the students of the varsity will lead the campaign explaining to people about the dangers from CAA/NRC/NPR. He said that during this campaign, students will approach five lakh people in Aligarh and over 30 lakh people across the nation through handbills/posters/booklets/videos. He added that students would be sent to different parts of the nation to address people and make them aware of the dangers of the Act. ""People will be informed that CAA, NRC and NPR are not needed in India and the present government is using its brute majority in Parliament to divide India on religious lines,” he said, adding that the government must listen to the voice of nation and roll back the divisive legislation. With India facing highest unemployment in 45 years, rise in joblessness, falling economy, dwindling democracy, rising crime rates, increasing pollution, more deaths of soldiers, widening inequality, deaths of farmers, exploitation of women, exponential corruption and crony capitalism, the ruling regime is trying to hide under the hate for minorities especially the Muslims, said AMU students. “We will tell the people that hate is not the solution of any problem, and the government must stop hate politics and preach love, pluralism, democracy and constitution,” said Imtiaz. He said, the struggle against CAA-NRC-NPR and the demands for resignation of AMU VC and registrar will continue within the campus. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

 CAA may be part of Lucknow University political science syllabus | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: In the midst of ongoing protests against the amended citizenship law, Lucknow University's political science department has come up with the idea of including it as a topic in its curriculum. ""We, in our department, teach Constitution and citizenship. This is one of the contemporary issues in Indian politics. We want to teach it to our students,"" political science department HOD Shashi Shukla said on Friday. ""As of now, it is at the stage of a proposal. Then it will pass through the entire academic process before it becomes a part of the syllabus,"" she said. There is a lot of debate underway on this topic, she said. ""Especially, our students come to us saying they are asked about it everywhere. This makes us think that it should be included as one of the many topics,"" Shukla said. ""It will, however, take some time. If approved by academic bodies it could be included by next year,"" she added. Noting that the department teaches about citizenship and the Constitution, Shukla said the issue was not introducing it as course. ""We have a paper on Indian politics in which we teach contemporary issues. This time we will include it also. It is just a proposal mooted by the faculty members,"" she said. BSP president Mayawati, however, said the proposal was ""completely wrong and unfair"" when the matter was being heard in court. In a tweet, she said, ""The debate on CAA is fine but when the court hearing is going on, the inclusion of this highly controversial and divisive citizenship law by the Lucknow University in its curriculum is completely wrong and unfair.

 Anti-CAA protests: 154 eminent citizens urge President to take action against those indulging in violence | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A group of 154 ""conscious, responsible and concerned citizens"" on Friday urged President Ram Nath Kovind to take action against those indulging in violence in the name of protests against the CAA and the NRC and ""safeguard"" the country's democratic institutions. The group consists of people who have retired from top government and constitutional posts and intellectuals. Central administrative tribunal (CAT) chairman and former chief justice of Sikkim high court Permod Kohli, who led the delegation that called on the President, alleged that some political elements were sponsoring the ""violent protestors"" and there is also an ""external dimension to the disturbances being created"". He, however, did not name any political party or individual ""instigating"" the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens. The delegates said they were concerned about the move to ""divide"" the country by ""some groups"" to create a ""vicious atmosphere"". We have no objection if the stir is peaceful without any inconvenience to the public, they added. The signatories to the memorandum, submitted to the President, include 11 former high court judges, 72 ex-bureaucrats including IAS, IPS, IFS officers and former ambassadors of India, 56 ex-top defence officers, intellectuals, academicians and medical professionals. The memorandum said the ""conscious, responsible and concerned citizens"" want the Centre to ""look into the matter with all seriousness and safeguard the democratic institutions of the country and take stern action against such forces"". ""Whenever India faced challenges on its borders and encountered the onslaught of some of the foreign invaders, it was more because of internal chicanery of individuals and small groups of people for their personal agendas and benefits who have from time to time tried to break the fabric of India's unity and cohesiveness. We are seeing this phenomenon again."" It alleged that the protests, ""while ostensibly claiming to oppose the policies"" of the Centre are in effect ""designed to destroy the very fabric"" of India and harm its unity and integrity. ""The fear-mongering which is being spread across the length and breadth of India appears to be motivated and with a sinister design to harm the nation,"" the memorandum added. ""The CAA does not impact on Indian citizens and hence claims that a citizen's rights and liberties are being infringed, does not stand scrutiny,"" it said.

 Substantial increase in outflow of Bangladeshi migrants post CAA enactment: BSF | India News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: The BSF on Friday said a substantial increase in the outflow of illegal Bangladeshi migrants to their home country has been recorded over the past one month, following the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). A top official of the paramilitary force said there has been a spike in the number of illegal settlers apprehended since last month. The outflow has been highest via North 24 Parganas district, which shares border with Bangladesh, BSF inspector general (South Bengal Frontier) YB Khurania said. ""There has been substantial increase in outflow of illegal Bangladeshi migrants to the bordering country in last one month. In January alone, we had apprehended 268 illegal Bangladeshi migrants, most of who were trying to sneak into the neighbouring country,"" Khurania told reporters. Those leaving the country were mostly engaged as masons, maids and housekeepers in the country, another Border Security Force (BSF) official said. ""The highest outflow is via North 24 Parganas district. They (migrants) were mostly based in Bangalore and North India. Some were involved in paltry jobs such as masons, maids, housekeepers and sweepers,"" he said. In 2019, the BSF had apprehended 2,194 Bangladeshis, most of them caught while trying to illegally sneak into India. But since December last year, things have changed, the official said. West Bengal shares about 2,216.7-km border with Bangladesh, a large portion of which is unfenced. According to BSF sources, troopers were not stopping the immigrants from crossing over to their home country, except in cases when they were found to be smuggling goods. ""Only when they are concealing any contraband or trying to smuggle something to Bangladesh, we are apprehending them. Otherwise, we are taking a note of their particulars and details and letting them go back,"" one of the sources said. The CAA seeks to provide Indian citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis who moved to India on or before December 31, 2014, having fled religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The law has emerged as major political flashpoint in West Bengal, with the TMC opposing the contentious legislation tooth and nail, and the BJP pressing for its implementation.

" Cannot issue blanket order against invoking NSA on anti-CAA protestors, says SC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Friday said it cannot issue blanket orders restraining authorities from invoking the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against people protesting the enactment of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). NSA cannot be allowed to be misused, the top court said but added that there cannot be a general command as public properties are being burnt during the protests and it may be organised. A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Indira Banerjee refused to entertain a plea challenging the imposition of NSA in few states as also in the national capital amid anti-CAA protests. ""We are of the opinion that general writ will not lie in this case. We cannot invoke powers under Article 32. We agree that the NSA should not be misused but there cannot be a general command. This will create chaos,"" the bench said. Petitioner-advocate M L Sharma said that anti-CAA protests are going on peacefully in Shaheen Bagh area of Delhi and other places and states should not be allowed to invoke the stringent law against the protestors. ""You show us a specific instance, where it has been done. We cannot issue a blanket order. If a general direction is passed this will create a chaos. You don't know what is going on in Calcutta, Tripura and Assam. Properties are being burnt and that may be organised. We don't know the antecedents of people,"" the court top said. Sharma persisted with seeking relief saying that people protesting peacefully may be booked under the law and the court should protect them. To this the bench said, ""If a person is involved in violence and involved in say hundred criminal cases. Then what would government do. Will not the government act?"" It asked Sharma to file an amended petition showing some specific instances where NSA has been invoked against the ant-CAA protestors. The bench told Sharma that he can also file an intervention application in the pending cases challenging the validity of CAA and seek appropriate relief. Sharma then sought liberty to withdraw the petition and file an amended petition giving specific details of violations of NSA, which was granted by the court. Sharma's plea said NSA has been imposed to curb and pressure people protesting against the CAA, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC). Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on January 10 had extended detaining powers to Delhi Police under the NSA for a three-month period starting January 19. This allows police to detain a person for 12 months without a trial. Sharma had made the Ministry of Home Affairs and the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Manipur parties to the plea. The plea had termed the notification, allowing police to invoke NSA to detain persons, as ""unconstitutional"" and violative of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution. ""The cause of actions arose on January 10, when respondents (states) imposed NSA Act for next three months with effect from January 19 in Delhi as well as in Andhra Pradesh by the state government to arrest and detain...for protests against a person holding office of the prime minister and ministers in the Central government...,"" the plea said, seeking a direction to quash the notification. The plea also sought that it be declared that the NSA cannot be used against protesters. Besides, it sought a compensation of Rs 50,00,000 each to those who have been detained so far under the NSA for ""mental agony, defamation in society and loss of reputation"".

80 Muslim leaders resign from Madhya Pradesh BJP over CAA | Indore News - Times of India,"INDORE: Around 80 Muslim leaders of the BJP in Madhya Pradesh on Friday resigned from the primary membership of the party in protest over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, calling it a ""divisive"" measure. One of the leaders, Rajik Qureshi Farshiwala, said around 80 Muslim partymen have resigned from the BJP's primary membership after writing to the newly-appointed national president, J P Nadda, on Thursday. These leaders, who dubbed the CAA ""a divisive provision made on religious grounds"", include several office- bearers of the BJP's minority cell, he said. ""It was becoming increasingly difficult for us to participate in our community's events after the CAA came into existence (in December 2019). ""At these events, people used to curse us and ask us how long we plan to keep quiet on a divisive law like the CAA?"" he said. ""Persecuted refugees of any community should get Indian citizenship. You cannot decide that a particular person is an intruder or a terrorist merely on the basis of religion,"" Farshiwala added. In their letter, the Muslim leaders stated, ""Citizens have right to equality under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. But the BJP-led Central Government is implementing the CAA on religious grounds. ""This is an act of dividing the country and against the basic spirit of the Constitution.""

 Centre's adamant attitude to implement CAA may lead to civil war-like situation: Netaji kin | India News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: The BJP-led central government's move to implement the new citizenship law and its proposal to conduct an NRC exercise across the nation might lead to a ""civil war-like situation"", Krishna Bose, a former TMC MP and kin of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, said on Friday. The Centre was going all out to target the Muslims, as was evident from its ""adamant attitude"" in enacting the contentious law, she claimed. ""Today, we are in a terrible situation, where the Centre is forcing its divisive principles (on people). It's clear that the Muslims in our country are being targeted by the Centre. And they (the Centre) are stating it directly. ""They are talking about other communities, the Buddhists, the Jains, and others, but only one name has been omitted and here lies the controversy. Why not include everybody who faced persecution? There is no doubt that CAA is targeted towards the Muslims,"" Bose told PTI. The octogenarian claimed that the implementation of CAA was an attempt to turn the country into a 'Hindu Rashtra', in tune with the vision of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. ""So far, the protests had been mixed... But what (the country) is going through might almost lead towards a civil war... I hope not but it looks like that,"" she contemplated. ""The ideology of the RSS to have a Hindu Rashtra has become a part of their (BJP's) belief system, too. They are very adamant about it and they are openly saying it,"" she said, referring to Union home minister Amit Shah's firm stand to implement the CAA. The former TMC MP also contended that the Narendra Modi government had no right to force its decision on common people, just because it won the polls by a mammoth majority. ""People are being labelled as traitors for protesting against the government. This is unacceptable. Freedom of speech and expression is at stake. You cannot say anything. This is terrible,"" she said. Drawing a parallel between the present-day India and Nazi Germany, she said, ""Everyone is recounting the days of (Adolf) Hitler. This was exactly how the situation was in 1930s, and he (Hitler) was quite popular at that time. Today the situation somewhat looks similar,"" she stated. On the role of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in spearheading the protests against the CAA, Bose said: ""It's she who began the agitation. She has been registering her protest with all heart and soul."" The former parliamentarian was also critical about the attacks on students at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi and at Viswa Bharati University in Bolpur. She, however, showered praise on the students' community for coming together at a time when the country is going through a ""critical time"". ""I am very happy that the youth and students have come forward in this critical hour, something that the opposition parties could not do. We should lend them support. ""But we can see they are being beaten up and treated in the cruelest manner. I am afraid for them. I pray and hope that they succeed. I want them to win this war. It is a ray of hope for us that the generation is conscious,"" she said. Bose urged the protesters to follow the ideals of Netaji, not mix religion with politics. ""There were Hindus, Muslims and Christians in Netaji's Azad Hind Fauj. They came together to fight for the country's Independence. Netaji had warned that religion and politics should not be mixed. He also said that it was easy to separate people who have been united by religion,"" she said, urging people to adopt the freedom fighter's slogan of Itmad (Faith), Ittefaq (Unity) and Kurbani (sacrifice).

The controversy worsened further on Thursday with the Ernakulam North police registering cases against both the woman and the meeting attendees, based on each other’s complaints. Police said the incident occurred when the woman, identified as Athira of Thiruvananthapuram, entered the hall, where the meeting named Mathrusangamam organised by Janajagarana Samithi was proceeding, and alleged that the speakers were “propagating lies”. This led to a minor scuffle and heated exchanges and the woman was finally pushed out of the hall.

Later on Tuesday, BJP industrial cell secretary C V Sajini who was speaking at the event at the time of the incident, filed a police complaint against the woman. Based on this, police registered an FIR against Athira under IPC Sections 447 (criminal trespass) and 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place). The police said Athira, a make-up artist, stays in a hostel near the temple. The case was transferred to women’s police station on Wednesday. “It was a closed-door programme and the woman barged in with abusive words. The participants pushing her out was a normal reaction. Police should probe the larger conspiracy behind the incident,” said Sajini. Based on Athira’s complaint on Thursday, police also registered a case against 29 people under IPC Sections 143, 147, 323, 294 b, 506 and 509 read with 149. “She said she was on her way to the bank when she happened to hear the speech which she alleged propagated lies.

"Give 10% quota to West UP students, they will take care of Jamia Millia Islamia &amp; JNU: Sanjeev Balyan | Meerut News - Times of India","MUZAFFARNAGAR: Union minister of state for animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries Sanjeev Balyan, who is BJP MP from Muzaffarnagar, said that nobody will be able to make anti-national slogans if people from western Uttar Pradesh are given 10% reservation in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Jamia Millia Islamia. Speaking at defence minister Rajnath Singh’s pro-CAA rally in Meerut on Wednesday, Balyan said, “I request Rajnath Ji to give 10% reservation to students from West UP in JNU and Jamia. No one else will be needed and they will take care of those who raise anti-national slogans. There is only one solution for them. This is a message to all those who are protesting against CAA.” Later, Balyan told TOI, “Jamia has 7,000-8,000 students. JNU has almost similar number. Meerut university has double the number of students enrolled in both the universities put together. These students support the CAA but their viewpoint isn’t highlighted in the media. The viewpoint of students in two universities (Jamia and JNU) cannot be the viewpoint of the students of the entire country.” Referring to violent protests in western UP districts after the passage of CAA, Balyan said there were deliberate attempts to stoke unrest in the region.

 PM Narendra Modi stokes divisions in the world’s biggest democracy: The Economist | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is apparently trying to transform India from a tolerant, multi-religious place into a chauvinist Hindu state, The Economist, published from London, wrote in a review of the BJP government's policies in the wake of the Citizenship Amendment Act. The Economist termed the Citizenship Amendment Act as NDA government's ""most ambitious step yet in a decades-long project of incitement"". The article further adds that the government's policies may have helped the Narendra Modi to win elections but the same have proven to be ""political poison"" for the country. It warns that Modi's initiatives, including the implementation of CAA, could lead to bloodshed. ""By undermining the secular principles of the constitution, Mr Modi’s latest initiatives threaten to do damage to India’s democracy that could last for decades,"" the magazine says. The article asserts that by creating divisions over religion and national identity; by constantly insinuating the Muslims as ""the dangerous fifth state"", the BJP has succeeded in keeping its support base energised and taken the focus away from a faltering economy. The magazine adds that the proposed National Register of Citizens will help the saffron party further its divisive agenda as the exercise could ""drag on for years, inflaming passions over and over again, as the list is compiled, challenged and revised"". In the process, the magazine claims, Modi will project himself as the saviour of the 80% Hindu population of the country. ""The citizenship row is only the latest in a series of affronts, from the BJP’s lionising of vigilantes thought to have killed Muslims to the collective punishment of the people of the Kashmir valley, who have suffered arbitrary arrests, smothering curfews and an internet blackout for five months,"" the article adds. The article further warns that a ""sustained persecution"" of one group is a threat to all and puts the political system ""at risk"".

The speakers termed CAA, NPR and NRC as “anti-poor and ‘anti-national” laws and appealed to non-Muslim religious minorities and those belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Schedules Tribes (ST) and lower Hindu castes to come forward and support the agitation. “The CAA, NRC and NPR combo is leading India towards the concept of Hindu Rashtra, which was established by Savarkar and Golwalkar. This concept has no place for non-Vedic religions. After Muslims, they will target Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs and all minorities in the country,” said professor Prajwalla Tatte. She also called on women from all religions to join the protests, saying that the new laws would suppress women in the future. Homeopathic practitioner Dr Shahwar Naziya claimed that giving citizenship to people from Pakistan and Afghanistan may bring back polio to India. “India was declared polio-free by WHO four years ago, but Pakistan is still grappling with it. People coming from Pakistan may bring polio back to India, as no one will check their health and immunization status while offering them citizenship,” she said. “We must oppose CAA for the future of our kids,” Naziya appealed. She received a rousing response from the women present at the protests. Dr Ratinath Mishra termed CAA and NPR as anti-India. “It is against the guiding principles of our constitution. The present government is following the ‘divide and rule’ policy of Britishers, and we will never let them succeed,” he said. A group of lawyers from district and high court visited Eidgah ground and expressed their support to the agitation. High court lawyer Ravi Shakar Bhure said that it is a massive conspiracy in which the judiciary is helpless too. “Citizens are protesting all over the country.

Officials said the sudden rush was predominantly driven by the fears arising out of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). “We have been observing the rush for birth certificates mainly from the members the Muslim community since January, who were born in the 1960s or 1970s. When asked, about 55 applicants admitted that they were seeking the birth certificates to prove their citizenship in the wake of the CAA and NRC,” medical expert Kalpana Baliwant, head of the birth and death registration office of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said.

Both Shah and the PM appear to be bent on destroying the spirit of the Constitution, and the secular fabric of our country,” rued the former MP.

Several local residents were visiting Park Circus Maidan every day when a group decided to organize a sit-in right here. “Firstly, several people from the Port area were not being able to commute so far every day. Secondly, we can connect with more people if we decentralize and start a movement in each of our neighbourhoods. Of course, if there is a bigger programme, all of us can join hands,” said one of the organizers.

Assam Youth Congress president held for CAA violence | Guwahati News - Times of India,"GUWAHATI: Assam Youth Congress president Kamrul Islam Choudhury, one of the alleged conspirators of the arson outside the state secretariat during anti-CAA protests in Guwahati on December 12, was arrested on Thursday. Choudhury, against whom police have registered as many as 32 cases relating to violent protests, had obtained a pre-arrest interim bail from the Gauhati high court in one of the cases on January 9. But on Thursday, when Choudhury went to Dispur police station for furnishing a bail bond and also appear before the investigation officer, as directed by the court, he was arrested in another case, police said. Choudhury has been charged under different sections of the IPC relating to endangering life or personal safety of others, being armed while rioting, being a member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence and knowingly joining or continuing in assembly of five or more persons after it was commanded to disperse together with sections under Prevention of Destruction of Public Properties' Act. The state government had earlier claimed that it has evidence of members of two fundamentalist Islamic organisations (Popular Front of India (PFI) and Campus Front of India), along with some Youth Congress members, trying to storm and set ablaze the state secretariat by posing as anti-CAA protesters on December 12. Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had even showed still pictures from TV footages and videos to the media in support of the government's claims that Choudhury was behind the arson and rioting in front of the secretariat. Denying the charges, Choudhury had then said, ""Yes, I, as a Congress member and a worker, did join the protests. But I was never involved in any kind of violence as alleged by Himanta Biswa Sarma.""

"NPR is nothing but NRC in disguise, says Kanhaiya Kumar | Kolkata News - Times of India","KOLKATA: “Today they are coming for your citizenship, tomorrow they will come after your property and then they will snatch your voting rights,” said Kanhaiya Kumar while addressing a nearly 15,000-strong crowd in the packed Debashree cinema hall ground near Barrackpore railway station on Thursday evening. The National Population Register (NPR) is NRC in disguise, he alleged. In the afternoon, several posters with derogatory statements against Kumar were found pasted near Titagarh Tata Gate off BT Road, near Barrackpore railway station and in an area leading to the meeting venue. Police later pulled some of these down. The agitators got into a scuffle with cops when a team from Titagarh police station arrived the spot. “Some BJP supporters who were found putting up posters and banners containing filthy language against Kanhaiya Kumar were caught red-handed,” an officer said. After the eight persons were arrested, another group of BJP supporters gheraoed Titagarh police station demanding their immediate release. When police tried to disperse the agitators, the BJP men put up a road block on BT Road near Titagarh police station for over half an hour. Sensing trouble, a tight security arrangement was made for Kumar’s meeting. BJP MP Arjun Singh, however, said, “Police had falsely implicated BJP supporters and arrested them. We are not bothered with Kanhaiya Kumar. The protest was against the false charges by police.” Kumar, later, received a rousing welcome by the crowd. “The Indian Constitution does not differentiate between its people based on religion, birth, language or caste. This new citizenship law, therefore, is unconstitutional and illegal,” he said, adding, “Their NRC brahmastra in Assam backfired. They tried to throw out Muslim infiltrators, but ended up making 12 lakh Hindus foreigners in their own country. They are using NPR as a ploy to evade the NRC issue. The NPR will try to identify doubtful citizens. These people will be asked to furnish additional documents, which they most likely will not be able to. And then they will use the NRC trick.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Battle between those who think &amp; those who hate: Arundhati Roy | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Author-activist Arundhati Roy, while delivering a speech at a city film festival on Thursday, said she was amazed at the solidarity and courage shown by students and women, who have been leading the protests against implementation of NRC and CAA since the bill was passed in November. “Within days of the Citizenship Amendment Act being passed, the students rose. AMU, Jamia, JNU, Jadavpur University. They showed us what courage and solidarity mean. They showed us that this is a battle between those who know how to think and those who know how to hate,” she said. She stressed that the most exciting thing about the ongoing protests is that they are led by women. “It is a liberalization for young women who are out on the road protesting,” said the author of ‘God of Small Things’ during the hour-long talk at the 7th Kolkata People’s Film Festival at Uttam Mancha in south Kolkata. Roy said the real purpose of an all-India NRC, coupled with CAA, is to threaten and destabilize the population by casting it into a maze of bureaucracy and documentation, that nobody, least of all the poor, can hope to have. She also strongly criticized the internet ban in Kashmir, wondering if a fire-walled internet is in the country’s future. “It is meant to create a tiered citizenship, in which one set of citizens has no rights and lives at the mercy of another — a modern caste system which will exist alongside the ancient one, in which Muslims are the new Dalits,” she said. She appealed to the audience to boycott NPR and NRC. “This government is in its second term and has a brute majority in Parliament. We have to prevail on the CMs of non-BJP states to refuse to implement CAA, NRC and NPR. India has a choice. Deep federalism or the risk of balkanization,” she said.

We should speak against CAA to save country: Nandita Das | Jaipur News - Times of India,"Actor Nandita Das on Thursday joined the list of celebrities opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act. She endorsed the series of protests being held at Shaheen Bagh and other parts of country. While speaking with reporters at JLF, she expressed her urge as a ‘human being’ to speak against such laws while denying any politics behind the protests. “I believe everyone should speak about it. In fact people are speaking. There are spontaneous protests all over country,” she said. She said the youth and common citizens protesting against the Act are triggering ‘hope’ while the CAA with National Register of Citizens (NRC) pose a dangerous mix. She insisted the CAA went against the sentiment of equality and divided people on religious lines. “People who have been here for generations and you are telling them this is not your country. This is upsetting,” she said. The Manto director was at the festival to speak about her experience of directing a movie and writing a book. “It is not easy to get technical aspect in the movie and apart from direction, it was also an emotional experience for me. In today’s scenario in the country, Manto’s struggle becomes even more important and relevant. Now even the Bollywood fraternity is speaking about the ongoing situation in the country.” She also appeared concerned on the issues of unemployment, economic slowdown and corresponding reports in foreign media. She felt India was being discussed as a country where people are being divided on religious lines. She was delighted that few members from the film fraternity, too, have spoken against the Act. She, however, seemed reluctant to discuss the ongoing controversy between the actors supporting the Act and those against it. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Gujarat HC refuses to quash FIR against anti-CAA protesters | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has refused to quash an FIR filed against some protesters of the Citizenship Amendment Act observing that the investigation into “the serious offence” is under way and at a very nascent stage. The court held the accused have not been able to establish that the HC should use its special powers to quash the FIR in this case. Four protesters including Amarnath Vasava were arrested in Chhapi town in Banaskantha district of north Gujarat, where the protesters had gathered in large numbers. The authorities had withdrawn permission to hold the programme at the last moment and detained Vasava and three others from their hotel in the morning of December 19, 2019. After the protests, police booked people including these four for rioting, unlawful assembly, creating rift between communities and criminal conspiracy. The protesters approached the HC saying that they had been in police detention at the time the alleged trouble took place. Still they have been implicated in the case. Cops had taken them to the venue at the insistence of the mob. The HC observed that their submission is attractive, but the cops had to take them to the venue due to demand of the mob, which had already started damaging property.

"CAA stir: Political parties hold peaceful protests, others must be vetted, Ahmedabad cops tell court | Ahmedabad News - Times of India","AHMEDABAD: The city police on Thursday explained before the Gujarat high court why they grant permission to political parties for rallies in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) or to oppose it, but refuse permission to those lacking credentials. After they refused permission to hold a protest rally in Jamalpur, two petitioners – Mudita Vidrohi and Mijahid Nafees – complained before the HC that the state administration straightaway grants permission to the ruling party for rallies in support of CAA but refuses permissions to those who want to oppose the new citizenship law. In reply, the city police claimed that this argument by the petitioner “is thoroughly misconceived”. It claimed that the rallies taken out by the BJP and Congress were both peaceful and the law and order situation was not threatened anywhere. The affidavit by assistant commissioner of police, I J Patel, said, “None of the instances (of rallies hosted by the ruling dispensation and the opposition) relied upon by the petitioners serve as a precedence which have threatened either law and order or public order. Moreover, permissions to such processions, if any given, are fact based and depending upon the credentials of the hosts.” Justifying denial of permission to gather 10,000 people to protest CAA in Jamalpur, the police questioned the credentials of the petitioners so far as their assurance to maintain peace in the area. The officer cited statements of residents, who requested cops not to grant permission to this protest programme fearing disruption of peace. To question the credentials of the petitioners, the police repeatedly cited the incident of the Shah-e-Alam protest held on December 19, 2019, which turned violent. The violence that took place in Shah-e-Alam was cited to refuse permission of a rally from Jamalpur Gate to Khamasa. It was reiterated that a huge crowd of 10,000 cannot be managed by police.

Dalit colony: Water source cut after 3 attend pro-CAA event in Kerala's Malappuram | Kozhikode News - Times of India,"MALAPPURAM: Twenty-two families of a dalit colony near Valanchery in Malappuram district were allegedly denied drinking water after three among them attended a pro-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) programme organized by BJP. The residents of Cherukunnu SC colony alleged that a Muslim family in the neighbourhood, which use to provide drinking water to them, stopped the supply from January 17, citing the participation of three among them in a ‘Janajagratha Sadass’ supporting CAA as the reason. The event was held at Valanchery town a week ago. After senior BJP leaders raised the issue through their Twitter handles on Thursday, revenue authorities decided to convene an all-party meeting and take immediate steps to restore the water supply. Most of the residents of the colony are BJP supporters. Akhila Cherukunnu Parambil, a resident, said the water supply scheme of grama panchayat was not functioning for more than a year and they were forced to walk around 1km to collect drinking water. “Recently, the Muslim family arranged a facility to pump water from a water source to their home. They offered three buckets of water to each of the family in the colony daily. On Friday, a woman member of the family told us that photos of three men of the colony attending the pro-CAA programme was being circulating on a social media group in the locality and the family cannot continue to provide water as they were under pressure from a section of people to stop the supply,” said Akhila. C P Velayudhan, a former CPM branch committee member, said the family stopped providing water suddenly and people in the colony, irrespective of party affiliations, were hit. Velayudhan said that he would bring the issue to the notice the CPM leaders. For the last three days, Sevabharathi unit in Painkannur has been supplying water to the colony. However, Sainudheen Kalappadathil, a member of the Muslim family, said: “We stopped supplying water due to technical issues. My wife never told them anything about CAA. These allegations are fabricated.” Meanwhile, Tirur tahsildar T Murali, who visited the colony on Thursday, said that revenue authorities will file a detailed report on the incident to district collector Jafar Malik on Friday. “Panchayat authorities will take immediate steps to provide water to the colony,” he said. “We are yet to verify the allegations of the colony residents,” added Murali.

Talking to reporters, Singh said that he and former MP and hockey Olympian Aslam Sher Khan would tour the state and create awareness on secularism like Mahatma Gandhi. “Today, Muslims of this country are frightened and have lost hope in the system as well as the police and political parties. There is one last ray of hope and that is the judiciary. Muslims are keenly watching if the Citizenship Act is rejected or upheld by the apex court. If this Act is accepted as constitutional, it will be the last nail in the coffin of secularism.” The former chief minister said, “If the Act is upheld, we don’t know what will happen in the country because no one can comprehend the amount of rage it will generate among the people. The protest against CAA-NRC has gone beyond the control of political parties, as they are being organised by students, women and children of minorities.” Digvijaya Singh said that it is important to restore the faith of minorities, who feel they are being targeted. He said that Hindu, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians had fought for freedom hand-in-hand and have taken India to the road of development.

"Nitish Kumar hits back at Pavan Kumar Varma, says he’s free to quit JD(U) | Patna News - Times of India","PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday virtually showed the door to senior JD (U) functionary and former Rajya Sabha MP Pavan Kumar Varma, who two days ago had sought “ideological clarity” over the party’s alliance with BJP for the Delhi assembly election. “He (Pavan Varma) is a learned person; I have respect for him, even if he doesn’t respect me. He can go wherever he wants,” Nitish, who is also JD (U)’s national president, said. The CM made the comment while talking to the media soon after he attended an event organised to celebrate the 123rd birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Nitish made it clear that there was “no confusion” in JD (U) on any issue and that it would not withdraw its support to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). He appeared to have taken exception to the way Varma made a letter written to him public. The letter talked about certain reservations Nitish had expressed during his private conversations with Varma, a former IFS officer. “You (Varma) should see for yourself what kind of statements you are making about your claims on what I said to you. Should I say what you used to tell me? This is not the way,” Nitish said. In his letter, which was later posted on social media, Varma said, “I remember you confessing to me in private how the current leadership in the BJP party has humiliated you. You maintained, on more than one occasion, that the BJP is leading India into a ‘dangerous space’… I fail to understand how JD(U) is now extending its alliance with BJP beyond Bihar”. During his conversation with the media, Nitish made it a point to send a strong message to Prashant Kishor, another senior JD (U) leader who is vocal in his criticism of the CAA and the National Register of Citizens. In an oblique reference to Kishor’s activities, Nitish said, “JD (U) should be understood properly. It works with complete dedication. Our stand on all issues is always very clear.” He added, “We are never in any confusion on any issue. But if anyone has any doubts, he should come and discuss. The matter can also be raised in party meetings.” In his response, Varma said in New Delhi that he only sought to know whether JD (U)’s alliance with BJP for the Delhi polls was discussed within the party before it was announced. He added, “I only sought to know whether this (alliance with BJP for Delhi polls) was done after ideological clarification or not. Even long standing allies of BJP like Akali Dal have refused to ally with BJP for the Delhi election due to their reservations against CAA.” Union minister Giriraj Singh, who hails from BJP, described the statements of Varma and Kishor as “harmful” for the NDA. “Whether it is Pavan Varma or Prashant Kishor, whatever they have said, is unhealthy for the alliance. Senior leaders of our party look at these statements from the point of view of discipline in the alliance as well,” he added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Why pose query if answering is optional: Congress | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Congress launched a fresh attack on the Modi government over the citizenship law and proposed NPR-NRC, saying it was likely that those who exercised the “option” of not answering certain questions may be put into the “doubtful” category by the government. Congress’ claims follows statement by junior minister for home G Kishan Reddy that disclosure of information for NPR will be voluntary and Union minister Prakash Javadekar saying that some NPR questions like date and place of birth of parents would be “optional”. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi asked if answering some questions was indeed optional as the minister had claimed, why did the government insist on keeping them in the questionnaire at all. He also slammed Javadekar for saying that certain columns in NPR are optional. “When it is optional then why is it there? Chances are that if the optional column is not filled, the person can be put in the doubtful list,” he said, adding that there is a “cocktail of suspicion and distrust against the government”. “When the atmosphere is of fear, trust deficit is humongous and when you have such rules then fear increases ten times,” Singhvi said, claiming that home minister Amit Shah’s insistence, for instance, on going ahead with CAA despite nationwide protests, had only deepened the trust deficit against the government. Congress also said that refusal by some states to implement CAA being described as “non-cooperation” is BJP-led misinformation campaign. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Political rivals invoke Netaji to speak on CAA | Kolkata News - Times of India,"Kolkata: Bengal politicians paid glowing tributes on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary on Thursday, and tried to justify their stance on CAA, both for and against. Kolkata mayor and Trinamool senior Firhad Hakim held that the central government couldn’t have promulgated the “divisive” citizenship law had Netaji been alive. “Netaji would never have allowed discrimination on religious lines. He had Prem Sehgal and Shah Nawaz Khan as his lieutenants,” Hakim said, remembering Netaji, who was once the city’s mayor. Bengal BJP also celebrated Netaji’s birth anniversary across the state. “We wouldn’t have to face Partition if Netaji was alive. He would have opposed the British plan supported by Muslim League and communists. Congress accepted Partition. If there was no Partition, the question of CAA wouldn’t have been there because the act provides citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains who were forced to leave Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu. Left parties took out a rally to observe “Deshprem Divas”. CPM politburo member Mohammad Selim said students raising “azadi” slogans are being termed anti-nationals by BJP when Netaji had set up the Azan Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) to fight for Independence. “Take a look at Netaji’s lieutenants — Prem Sehgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. They came from different communities and religions, representing Netaji’s dream of a secular India.

Dissent was sedition in the British Raj, but no one ""discovered"" Nazi affiliations in those who drew those kolams. It was left to free India to accuse Tamil women registering peaceful kolam protests of Pakistani connections. Though the arts have no sustained, discerning support from state or society, this does not absolve artists of their responsibilities. Nor does lack of resources strip them of their power. A song, painting, verse, or a humble kolam, can unmute the silent, empower the disenfranchised and enable the humblest to curb the mightiest. The civil rights movement in the United States, led by such legends as Martin Luther King, was cemented by African-American spirituals. Anti-apartheid songs compelled the world to take note of atrocities in South Africa. Activist choirs in the Balkans keep protests for human rights alive. Braving charges of terrorism, Latin America continues to sing against multi-forms of oppression. In Hong Kong, subversive art on the streets and social media continues to support the demand for liberty. All over the world, activists, artists and thinkers use their creative powers to take on the neocolonial juggernaut. India’s independence movement witnessed diverse factions uniting with the clarion call of ""Vande Mataram"". Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s ode to the motherland (1882), translated into other tongues (including the recent ""Tasleemaat maa tasleemaat"" in Urdu), invoked pan-Indian pride. Though it united more than divided communities, its reference to Hindu gods prevented this ode from becoming secular India’s national anthem. However, it was Bankim’s song and not his own that Tagore chose to sing at the 1896 convention of the Indian National Congress, whose goals prioritised unity among people of different faiths. Early ""Indian"" flags — including the one unfurled in 1906 flag to protest against the British partitioning of Bengal — had ""Vande Mataram"" inscribed in bold Devanagari script. Proclaiming Hindu-Muslim brotherhood, the green strip below juxtaposed the sun with the crescent moon and star. In 1904, Mohammad Iqbal’s poem announced the same idea: ""Religions do not teach hatred. We belong to Hind, our homeland is Hindustan!"" Neither Partition nor Iqbal’s subsequent allegiance shift to the Islamic state could dislodge that song from India’s collective unconscious. Famously did astronaut Rakesh Sharma sum up what he saw from space with Iqbal’s opening line, ""Saare jahan se accha Hindustan hamaara"". In contrast, we see the recent branding of Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s poem as anti-Hindu, when everyone knows the man wrote it to trounce dictatorship in Pakistan. How ignorant we must be to not to see him subverting the imagery of Islam, and using the word ""buth"" not for Hindu gods, but for the idols of totalitarianism. Today his words ""Hum Dekhenge"" is resonate across the country and people are reaffirming the relevance of Faiz with translations in regional languages, including in Tamil. For a heart-wrenching example of what art can achieve, we must time travel back to Leningrad (St Petersburg), 1942. Under the sparkling chandeliers in the packed Philharmonic Hall, a skin-and-bones orchestra determinedly stands up in frayed clothes, but with bow ties, hoping that Nazi bombardment would not drown its music. Loudspeakers relay Dmitri Shostakovich’s grand symphony throughout the city where millions are dying of hunger, forced to survive on anything they find — cats, rats, dogs, horses, and reportedly, human corpses. The last notes fade in haunting silence, and applause celebrates how the listeners ""lived it, survived it, and managed to preserve their humanity"". They were to face three more years of war. Decades later, a few German soldiers return to the city they had blockaded. Why? To recall how spellbound they had been by the ""Leningrad Symphony"" sweeping over their dark trenches bordering the city. Shostakovich had taught them that art can steel the human spirit to resist every kind of oppression. Bodies can be smashed by force, but not the soul. Not when communities are inspired and empowered by word, visual and song. No wonder then that the establishment in every part of the globe fears art, and employs every tool from fatwa and imprisonment to banning and burning books, paintings and films. Art has ""fearsome"" attributes indeed. It brings people together, sets the mind free, and instils hope. That is why Chopin, in exile, kept the soul of Poland together when the country was mowed down. And Picasso remains best known for ""Guernica"" his spine-chilling indictment of violence and repression.

"Braving cold, protesters against CAA vow to keep flame burning | Kanpur News - Times of India","Kanpur: Protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Mohammad Ali Park in Chamanganj area continued on Wednesday even as chief minister Yogi Adityanath addressed a rally in the city to drum up support for the new law. People, including women and youngsters, joined the protest in large numbers and claimed that the citizenship law is unconstitutional and discriminatory. Holding placards reading ‘No CAA, No NPR, No NRC’, the protesters waved the national flag and sang patriotic songs. Women protesters said they would continue their protest against the law as it was biased against a particular community. Mohammad Ali Park near Halim crossing in Chamanganj has been witnessing anti-CAA protests on the lines of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. Protests in Kanpur, however, are confined to this park where people from different faiths and communities are joining in. Shahbuddin, a protestor, said CAA was against one community and the government should withdraw it. “People from all walks of life are protesting here. However, we are not allowing any politician to participate in the protest,” he added. Hilmi, a woman protester, said: “The government should also give citizenship to Muslims facing persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Why Muslims have been left out by the government?” Women protesters said they were braving extreme weather just to demand that the government should roll back the law as it was against the Constitution.

" Raj Thackeray turns saffron again, backs Modi | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, who had attacked the Modi government during the 2019 Lok Sabha poll campaign, turned saffron all over again on Thursday, coming out in full support of the Citizenship Amendment Act and asking local Muslims why they were protesting in favour of Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims. “Throw out the illegal Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims. I fully support the Centre for this,” Raj said at the MNS’ first ever convention at the Nesco grounds, Goregaon, marking 14 years of its formation. The convention saw the induction of Raj’s son Amit Thackeray as leader of the party, making it clear that the MNS chief now wants to groom him for a larger role in party politics at a time when Amit’s cousin Aaditya is a minister in the state government. Raj said that while he had criticised PM Modi, he would not hesitate to support him when he does the right thing. “India needs to intensify its security even if it means people are inconvenienced. We are sitting on a ticking bomb. It is important to throw out the Muslims from Pakistan and Bangladesh and for this I am with the Prime Minister,” he said. He announced his party would hold rallies on February 9 in support of the CAA. Like other countries, India must act against illegal migrants, he said. While Raj said he stood for Muslims of the country, he noted that he would not tolerate those Muslims who “fanned trouble in the country.” Defending Urdu, he said it was not the language of the Muslims and reminded his supporters that Bangladeshis had demanded a separate country for the Bengali language and not for Urdu. “Is India a dharamshala? I am told it costs only Rs2,500 to make your way from Bangladesh into India. From Pakistan they come via Nepal. Stop the Samjhauta Express and the bus service. Why do we have any relations with Pakistan?” he asked. Religion, he said, was a personal thing. Targeting Muslims, he said, “Keep your religion in your house. Shut off the loudspeakers on masjids. Our aarti does not trouble, why should namaz trouble others?” Raj, who changed his party’s flag to saffron with Shivaji Maharaj’s royal seal on it, said the flag had been first used by the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti which, however, later disintegrated, leading to the birth of the Shiv Sena. “When the MNS was being formed in 2006 I wanted to make this the party flag, but advisors told me to include green -- what they now call social engineering. I was 36-37 years old then and there was no one to guide me, so I went along. But the flag never left me and six years ago, we used it at our annual party rally during Gudi Padva,” he said. “This flag is my DNA and I decided to bring it forth for this convention. The Raj Mudra (Shivaji’s royal seal) is our inspiration. This flag is to be well taken care of by the one handling it and not left lying on the floor. This flag is not to be used during elections, for that we have the other flag,” he said. On changing the party flag, he said the Jan Sangh in the 80s had changed its flag and name to Bharatiya Janata Party. “One has to shed one’s old skin for a positive change,” he said. In his speech, he said he was a Marathi and a Hindu and would fight anyone who challenged these identities. On him going the Hindutva way, Raj said no one asked him if he was standing up for Hindutva when he protested against the Raza Academy demonstrators misbehaving with women constables or when party workers chased away Pakistani singers. Nor did anyone ask if he was for Hindutva when he resisted restrictions placed on the number of tiers for dahi handi. “Why are you asking now where we are going?” he asked. He alleged there were “mohallas” in Maharashtra where a conspiracy was being hatched against the country. He said he would share this information with the Union home minister and the chief minister. He congratulated PM Modi on nullifying Article 370 and the Supreme Court for allowing the Ram Mandir. MNS spokesperson Nitin Sardesai announced the party would set up a shadow cabinet that will take up people’s issues and not allow the government to distract the public with “inane” controversies like the recent one over the book comparing Narendra Modi with Shivaji Maharaj. Members of the shadow cabinet would be announced shortly, Sardesai said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Pranab Mukherjee: Countrywide protests will enable deepening of India’s democratic roots | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The largely peaceful protests being held in the country would enable a deepening of India’s democratic roots, and the assertion of the youth and their belief in the Constitution was heartening to see, former President Pranab Mukherjee said here on Thursday. “The last few months have witnessed people come out on the streets in large numbers, particularly the young, to voice their views on issues which in their opinion are important,” Mukherjee said at a function organised by the Election Commission. “Democracy thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent. I believe the present wave of largely peaceful protests that have gripped the country shall once again enable the further deepening of our democratic roots,” Mukherjee said. His remarks come in the wake of agitations against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and NPR-NRC. Delivering the Sukumar Sen lecture instituted by the EC, Mukherjee said: “The Election Commission has served its purpose well and any attempt at its denigration will amount to denigrating the electoral process. People’s mandate is sacrosanct and its sanctity supreme. The onus of ensuring this lies with the EC. They must do so and put any speculation to rest.” People’s mandate must be above any iota of reasonable doubt, he said. The former President also took note of the challenges faced by the Indian electoral system and referred to the embargo on sanctioning and implementation of development projects once the election code of conduct kicked in and the disproportionately large size of the electorate vis-à-vis public representatives. He also said adequate representation of women in Parliament and state assemblies remained a major area of concern. “If democracy has succeeded, it is largely due to the perfect conduct of elections by all election commissioners starting from Sukumar Sen to the present election commissioners,” Mukherjee said. In his opening remarks, chief election commissioner Sunil Arora thanked Mukherjee, and said the objective of the lecture was to make a positive intervention in the democratic and electoral discourse, within the ambit of the constitutional mandate of the EC. “The EC wishes to involve a wide cross-section of people, including political parties, leading constitutionalists, legal luminaries, academicians, civil society activists in it,” Arora said.

 Present wave of peaceful protests in country will help deepen India's democratic roots: Pranab | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Describing listening, arguing and dissent as essence of democracy, former president Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday said he believes that the present wave of largely peaceful protests that have ""gripped"" the country will once again enable the deepening of India's democratic roots. He also cautioned that while India's tryst with democracy is a story which needs to be told time and again, ""complacency enables authoritarian tendencies to gain ground"". Mukherjee pointed out that in the last few months people, particularly the youth, come out on the streets in large numbers to voice their views on issues ""which in their view are important"". ""Their assertion and belief in the Constitution of India is particularly heartening to see,"" he said at the first Sukumar Sen memorial lecture organised by the Election Commission here. Indian democracy has been tested time and again, he said, adding that consensus is the lifeblood of democracy. In an apparent reference to protests in parts of the country against the amended Citizenship Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the veteran leader said, ""The last few months have witnessed people come out on the streets in large numbers, particularly the young, to voice their views on issues which in the opinion are important."" Their assertion and belief in the Constitution is particularly ""heartening"", he noted. Democracy, he said, thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent, he said in his address. According to a copy of the speech made available after the event, he said, ""I believe the present wave of largely peaceful protests that have gripped the country shall once again enable the further deepening of our democratic roots.""

UP: Nationalist slogans dominate BJP's pro-CAA rally in Agra | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: Slogans of Jai Sri Ram and Bharat Mata ki Jai rent the air at the well attended BJP’s public meeting, organized in support of the CAA, at Kothi Meena Bazar ground on Thursday. If slogans of “azadi from CAA” have been the flavour of the anti-CAA protests in UP, particularly AMU, it were nationalistic slogans and the Modi chant that dominated the public meeting which was addressed by BJP’s national president, JP Nadda, chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, party’s state president Swatantra Dev Singh. Though the crowd at the rally was impressive by local standards, it was far less than the 1.5 lakh figure that was being touted by the party leaders a day earlier. Party workers reached the venue with posters and banners of “We support CAA” and kept shouting slogans of “Jai Sri Ram”, “Vande Matram” and “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”. Chants of “Modi.. Modi” were also raised. BJP activists had also carried a 51 feet long national flag, which in fact turned out to be a major attraction of the rally. Interestingly, people who reached the venue wearing black outfits, were turned back by the cops on duty, as organizers feared that they might take them off and waive them during the speeches by party leaders. The busy area around the venue witnessed traffic jam for almost an hour, as the police had cordoned off several access routes. The rally, which started around 2:10 pm, finished at about 3:15pm.

 SC upholding CAA as constitutional will be final nail in coffin of secularism: Digvijaya | India News - Times of India,"BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Thursday said that if CAA is upheld by the Supreme Court as Constitutional, then it would be the “last nail in the coffin of secularism”. Singh was speaking to reporters here and announced that he and former MP and hockey Olympian Aslam Sher Khan would be touring the state and fighting for secularism like Mahatma Gandhi did. “Today, Muslims of this country are frightened and have lost hope in the system, police and political parties,” Digvijaya Singh said. “There is one last ray of hope and that is the judiciary. They (Muslims) are watching if an unconstitutional Citizenship Act is rejected or upheld. If in Modi-Shah reign, this unconstitutional act is accepted as Constitutional, then this will be the last nail in the coffin of secularism.” The former chief minister also cautioned, “If the Act is upheld, we don’t know what will happen in this country because no one can comprehend the amount of rage in people. This movement (against CAA-NRC) has gone out of the hands of political parties. One the one hands are students and on the other, women and children of minorities.” Digvijaya Singh argued that present situation in minorities is such that “faith has to be restored in persons who feel they are being targeted.” He said that Hindu, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians fought for freedom together and took India in the road of development. The Rajya Sabha MP and former hockey player Aslam Sher Khan will start touring the state to spread the message of communal harmony. “We will travel and talk to those who believe in secularism and Hindu-Muslim unity. We will fight the way Mahatma Gandhi fought for Hindu-Muslim unity,” he said. “Maybe there will be attacks on us but we are not bothered.

Four protesters, including Amarnath Vasava were arrested in Chhapi town in north Gujarat district of Banaskantha, where people gathered in a large number. The authorities had withdrawn the permission to hold the programme at the last moment and detained Vasava and three others from their hotel in the morning of December 19, 2019. After the protests, police booked people including these four for rioting, unlawful assembly, creating rift between communities and criminal conspiracy. They approached the HC saying that they had been detained by police at the time the alleged trouble took place. Still they have been implicated in the case. Cops had taken them to the venue at the insistence of the mob. The HC observed that though the submission is attractive, but cops had to take them to the venue because of the demand from the mob, which had already started damaging property. Two of the accused delivered speeches and shouted slogans, though there was no permission to hold the programme, the HC said. Moreover, the high court said that the investigation into this 'serious offence' is underway and it is at a very nascent stage.

 SC to hear plea against imposition of NSA amid anti-CAA protests | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court would hear on Friday a fresh plea challenging the imposition of the National Security Act (NSA) in few states and the national capital empowering police to detain persons sans trial for a period of 12 months. A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Indira Banerjee is likely to hear the plea filed by lawyer M L Sharma questioning the imposition of the NSA, saying that it has been done to curb and pressure people protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC). Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on January 10 extended detaining powers to Delhi Police under the NSA for a three-month period starting January 19. This allows police to detain a person for 12 months without trial. Sharma has made the ministry of home affairs and the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Manipur parties to the plea. The plea has termed the notification, allowing police to invoke NSA to detain persons, as ""unconstitutional"" and violative of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution. ""The cause of actions arose on January 10, when respondents (states) imposed NSA Act for next three months with effect from January 19 in Delhi as well as in Andhra Pradesh by the state government to arrest and detain...for protests against a person holding office of the prime minister and ministers in the Central government...,"" the plea said. The plea has sought a direction to quash the notification. It has also sought a direction that it be declared that the NSA cannot be used against protesters. The plea has also sought a compensation of Rs 50,00,000 each to those who have been detained so far under the NSA for ""mental agony, defamation in society and loss of reputation"".

Bid to begin Shaheen Bagh like anti-CAA protest by Muslim women foiled in Varanasi | Varanasi News - Times of India,"VARANASI: Bid to begin Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and Lucknow’s Ghantaghar like anti-CAA protest by a group of Muslim women and men at Benia Bagh ground here on Thursday was foiled by police. Police took 10 men protesters under custody while women protesters managed to escape. Some anti-social elements also tried to create panic by indulging in brick batting outside the ground. Around 12 noon over a dozen Muslim women gathered near Gandhi Chaura inside Benia Bagh ground and started anti-CAA sit-in stir. Within few minutes some men of adjoining Muslim dominated localities also reached there to join them. On getting information heavy police force reached there from Chetganj, Chowk and Dashaswamedh police stations. Later, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma, SSP Prabhakar Chawdhary and other senior officers also reached there with police, PAC and RAF. Police asked the protesters to show district administration permission letter for holding protest. When the protesters made it clear that they had not taken permission for their protest police started taking them under custody. It led to a scuffle between the cops and protesters. In the meantime some anti-social elements pelted stones from outside the ground and fled the scene. Taking advantage of the chaos created by such brick batting the women protesters fled the scene. SSP said that 10 men protesters had been taken under custody and sent to police lines. The women protesters had managed to escape, he added. The DM said that district administration had already made it clear that as prohibitory order under section 144 is promulgating in the district any peaceful protest or agitation can take place with permission of district administration only. In recent weeks permissions had also been issued for the protests of Congress and Communist party, he said adding, but on Thursday some anti-social elements tried to disturb law and order by staging sit-in at Benia Bagh ground without any permission from district administration. DM said that this bid of protest had been foiled and many have been taken under custody to initiate legal action against them. Apart from Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, Lucknow’s Ghantaghar and other major cities the Muslim women had also staged a day-long protest at Karbala ground of Azamgarh district in east UP region on Tuesday in protest against CAA, NRC and NPR.

Sam Stafford pierced by two bullets: Post-mortem | Guwahati News - Times of India,"GUWAHATI: Sam Stafford, a 17-year-old student who died in police firing during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests last month, was shot twice, through his chin and from behind by police, a post-mortem report has revealed. The incident took place on December 12 evening in Hatigaon area of Guwahati while he was returning from a protest organised against the CAA in another part of the city.

The other injuries were caused by ""blunt force impact"". Soon after receiving the post-mortem report, Sam's family has filed an FIR in Hatigaon police station, accusing the police of murder (Section 302 IPC) and carrying out a ""criminal act"" by several persons (Section 34 IPC). Sam's mother Mamoni Stafford has urged civil organisations and rights groups to come forward to help the family.

Guwahati-based child rights organisation, Universal team for Social Action and Help (UTSAH), demanded a fair inquiry into the killing and said it will approach the commission for children's rights and move court. Miguel Das Queah, founder of UTSAH, said, ""We are exploring the best way to help the family get justice. We are demanding accountability from the police. So many laws mentioned in the Assam police manual and the UN convention on children's right which India committed to 1992 have been violated.

Latur activists began their three-day sit-in agitation from Wednesday evening at the Dr Ambedkar Park, where hundreds of people had gathered to express their solidarity with the protesters. Different groups have come together to form ‘Amhi Laturkar, CAA, NRC Virodhi Jan Andolan’, to resist the CAA and NRC. Uday Gaware, a lawyer activist, said that despite his age, Kulse joined the agitation because he feels that the new law was intended at dividing the people. “The central government’s move was an attempt to create a rift between different communities and cause havoc and confusion in the country. This was being done to divert people’s attention from core issues such as falling economy, increasing prices of essential commodities and rising unemployment,” Gaware claimed. Intellectuals and social activists from across the country were expected to arrive in Latur over the next couple of days to join in their agitation. Gaware said that these moves were not limited to targeting Muslims, but the government intended to hit Hindus too, particularly sections like Adivasi, OBC, Buddhists, and other communities.

Addressing a rally in support of the CAA, he said “Unko (Muslims) koi chimte se bhi chhoo nahi sakta hai, (nobody can touch them)"", adding that even Gandhiji wanted citizenship for persecuted minorities of neighbouring countries. ""There are certain forces which want to create a divide bteween Hindus and Muslims on the issue of CAA. These forces have vested interests in creating a rift between the communities. I appeal to everyone that communal tension on religious lines should not be created,"" Rajnath later tweeted after the rally held in Meerut’s Shatabdi Nagar area. Addressing the rally, he said: “Gandhi ji didn’t want the partition of India on religious lines but it did happen. So, it becomes our duty to be sensitive towards the interests of persecuted minorities in those countries. They should be given citizenship. Even Mahatama Gandhi wanted citizenship for persecuted minorities comprising Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, Jains.” “In 2003, former PM Dr Manmohan Singh also reiterated the need for it during his speech in Rajya Sabha. We are only following what they wanted. Have we done some crime by doing so,” said Singh, who was flanked by state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh another Union minister and Muzaffarnagar MP Sanjeev Balyan, Party’s West UP in charge Ashwani Tyagi, BJP former state president Laxmikant Bajpai and local MP Rajender Agarwal. The defence minister said that those from minority community who are living in pitiable conditions in Pakistan are mainly Dalits and the poor. “Why should anyone have problem with an Act that provides them relief?” he asked, adding “We are asked why Muslims from other countries are not given citizenship?” “ Let me tell them that this Act is made for those victims who are facing religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. These nations are not secular countries. They are Islamic countries but India is not a Hindu country and is a secular country. And religious persecution can take place only in a country which is a religious state that is why we included non-Muslims in the CAA and not Muslims,” he explained.

"Shashi Tharoor: Resolutions against CAA 'political gesture', states hardly have any role | India News - Times of India","KOLKATA: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said that bringing in resolutions against the CAA is more of a ""political gesture"" by the states as they hardly have any role in granting citizenships. In an interview to PTI, the lawmaker said that in the implementation of the National Population Register (NPR) and the proposed nationwide NRC, the states will have a vital part as it will be their officials who will conduct the exercise because the Centre doesn't have the required manpower. ""That's more of a political gesture. The citizenship is given by the federal government only and obviously no states can give citizenship, so it has nothing for them to implement or not implement,"" Tharoor said. ""They (the states) can pass a resolution or go to the court but in practice what can they do? The state governments can't say they won't implement CAA, what they can say is they will not implement NPR-NRC as they will have a crucial role in it,"" he added. Tharoor's party colleague Kapil Sibal raised a storm last week by saying there is no way a state can deny the implementation of the CAA when it has already been passed by Parliament. Later, he termed it ""unconstitutional"" and clarified there was no change in his stance. Punjab, where the Congress is in power, passed a resolution against the CAA last week. It also supported a similar move by the Left government in Kerala. In West Bengal as well, Tharoor's party has been demanding an anti-CAA resolution, which will be brought in by Mamata Banerjee's government on January 27. The Congress has hinted that it may pass similar resolutions in other states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh where it is in power. Maintaining that the Supreme Court not directing a stay on the Citizenship Amendment Act has ""not at all diluted"" the protests against it, Tharoor welcomed the top court's decision to set up a five-judge constitution bench. ""This Act by naming religions in relation to citizenship has violated the Constitution... But at least the five-judge constitution bench will hear all the arguments and look into the merits of it. That's the only way we can resolve the fundamental disagreement,"" he said. ""There are only two ways this law can be struck down -- one, if the Supreme court declares it unconstitutional and strikes it down and second, if the government itself revokes it. Now, the second option is not viable as the BJP would never accept its mistakes,"" said the Thiruvananthapuram MP who was in the city to take part in the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet. He said the protests are largely spontaneous and if the government makes it clear that no religion is being targeted then many would lose their reason for protesting. However, the diplomat-turned-politician said the government needs to do much more than just removing the religion clause in the CAA. ""It needs to say we will not ask questions about place of birth and citizenship and will not prepare the NRC,"" he said. On the country's opposition, Tharoor said their unity has never been easy in Indian politics as many parties may have a similar stand at the Centre but may differ in the states. ""In my opinion, it would be simply better to present a united front to the nation rather than a divided front,"" he said, asserting that no one should feel threatened by the Congress. Asked about the Gandhi family and the role of the present leadership in reviving the party, Tharoor said Congress is more than a family, and it is not only a major mass movement but also a set of coherent ideas. ""Yes, when we ask people to vote for Congress, some vote for the family, some vote for individuals, but above all they vote for a certain set of principles and convictions,"" he said. Tharoor said the Congress stands for inclusiveness and is the only viable and reliable alternative to the ""divisive politics"" of the BJP. ""We have just lost the national elections. We have a four-and-quarter year to go before we can prove our qualities on the national stage. In the meantime, there are state elections... So there will be a constant opportunity for a referendum against the BJP's non-performance,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Though, it is the responsibility of the apex court to fix the error made by the government, but its refusal to put a stay on CAA has disappointed us,” said Hamid. On December 18, the Supreme Court had issued notice to the Centre and sought its response by the second week of January on a batch of pleas filed against CAA.

Muslim professionals strengthen anti-CAA protests across Telangana | Hyderabad News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: Recent weeks have seen thousands of people from across the city and the state taking to the streets protesting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The JAC approached several professionals who can help out with the protests, and the committee includes a few non-Muslim advocates, and women, too. “We are trying to get in touch with as many people as possible, we were very active at Nampally criminal court, and other courts around the city,” founder of the group, Suhail Malik, who now dons the role of a public relations officer, told TOI. “Many people from the districts will also join us soon.” The group mainly renders legal help free of cost to activists who were arrested during the protests, besides participating in anti-CAA protests. “Group members debate on these subjects to enhance their knowledge and to help people,” said Hameed, one of the key members of the JAC. He said that the group has been able to help many people. Interestingly, the group is being approached by several NGOs and religious groups to seek clarity and information on National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). “Many people are worried as they do not have birth certificate, so we explain them about NPR and how to apply for birth certificate,” said a member of the JAC.

He said every deity is considered a minor and has to be represented in court by a priest, trustee or the executive officer. “Under Section 5(4) of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act a minor can obtain citizenship rights, so deities of all the temples can be given citizenship rights under this provision. Register all Hindu deities like Venkateswara Swamy in Tirumala, Ayyappa Swamy in Sabarimala, and Padmanabhaswamy in Kerala as citizens under Section 5(4) of CAA,” Rangarajan said. Rangarajan said that the verdict in Sabarimala temple case showed that the secular state of India is a threat to a Hindu deity’s religious freedom. “Despite the constitutional provisions and judicial decisions, Hindu temples and religious and charitable institutions are routinely taken over by the secular state on the pretext of mismanagement, whereas other religious places are exclusively managed by the respective communities even though Article 26 confers Right to Equality among all sections of citizens,” the chief priest said. On Wednesday, a wood-carved idol of the Dalit Alwar, being carried by an archaka, was worshipped at Chilkur. Hundreds of devotees performed pradakshinas with the idol in an enactment of 2,700-year-old ritual. The Temples Protection Movement (TPM), along with other organisations, are planning to conduct special prayers at historic Ranganadha Swamy temples located in different parts of the region, said Rangarajan.

"Goa: Church to hold public meet against CAA, NPR on Friday | Goa News - Times of India","PANAJI: The Council of Social Justice and Peace (CSJP), which is the social work wing of the Catholic Church, will protest the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) at a public meting at Lohia Maidan, Margao, on Friday. The group will be joined by the National Confederation for Human Rights (Goa unit) and Concerned Citizens for Democracy. “It is our common conviction that these measures are unconstitutional and, therefore unacceptable. The government must listen to the voice of the people and withdraw the Act. It can then engage in wide consultation if it still wishes to proceed with any form of legislation regarding citizenship,” CSJP’s executive secretary Fr Savio Fernandes told reporters at Margao on Wednesday. He said the government should also take note that this is the first time since the Partition that people across the country have demonstrated an unyielding show of unity to register their protests on the streets. Educationist Prabhakar Timble and social activists Oscar Rebelo, Rama Kankonkar, Muzafar Shaikh are scheduled to speak at the Margao rally. The council has stated that the government is resorting to the abuse of law and order mechanisms and intelligence agencies to suppress this people’s movement. “We have noticed how, in many parts of the country, the government has been high-handed in undermining the protests. It has unleashed violence and adopted intimidating tactics against peaceful protesters. Here in Goa, conceding to threats by a fringe group, permission granted to citizens of Mapusa for a peaceful protest was revoked on flimsy grounds,” Fernandes said. “It is unlawful to disenfranchise genuine citizens whose legal rights to stay in this country cannot be challenged. In view of this vicious and deceitful method of de-citizenising millions of people, must not only reject the proposed NPR process but refuse to cooperate,” he added.

"Delhi assembly elections: BJP campaign to focus on nationalism &amp; Hindutva, explaining CAA to people | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: With almost a fortnight to go before the February 8 elections for Delhi Assembly, BJP has planned a high-pitch campaign which will revolve around nationalism and Hindutva. Senior party functionaries said that apart from talking about the “failures” of the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, the campaigners will project the amended citizenship law, triple talaq, abrogation of Article 370 and 35A and the favourable ruling in the Ram temple case as achievements of the Narendra Modi-led central government in small group meetings across the city.  Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections“Opposition parties have been misleading people on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act and inciting violence. We need to clear the air and expose them,” said a senior party functionary. “We have conducted several public meetings and door-to-door campaigns informing people about the features of the act and how it is not about taking away the citizenship of anyone in the country.” “While other parties ran away from big challenges such as abrogation of Article 370, making triple talaq a criminal offence and the issue of Ram temple, it is BJP which delivered on what it promised. People must know and remember while casting their votes,” he added. The party has planned over 5,000 group meetings, with about 200-500 people each, which would be addressed by top party leaders. On Thursday, Union home minister Amit Shah will begin the campaign by addressing two such meetings and participating in a padyatra in Matiala, Uttam Nagar and Nagloi Jat assembly segments. Addressing a booth workers’ convention on January 5, Shah had mentioned that the party’s focus in Delhi polls would be on smaller corner meetings though there were a few public rallies, to be addressed by PM Narendra Modi, BJP national president JP Nadda and himself, closer to the election date. On Wednesday, the party released a list of 40 star campaigners, including Modi, Shah, Nadda, several Union ministers, chief ministers of BJP-served states, Bollywood stars Hema Malini and Sunny Deol and Bhojpuri actors Ravi Kishan and Nirahua. Rajya Sabha member Vijay Goel said some party leaders have also been asked to go to slum clusters and unauthorised colonies, stay overnight and have a discussion around a “bonfire” over a “cup of tea”. “We will tell them how the AAP government has failed to deliver on various promises and blocked Aayushman Bharat and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. But we will also tell them how opposition parties are defining the CAA in an incorrect manner and even inciting violence on the issue,” he said. There will be campaigning outside metro stations, discussions in the metro, outreach programmes targeting various communities and roadshows and public rallies in the last leg of electioneering. The party prepared a roadmap for the next 15 days at a closed-door meeting late on Tuesday evening. It was attended by all top leaders. “The message that the party leadership conveyed to everyone is that BJP is winning this election and it should be visible in the party’s campaign. It should be intense and direct and focus on the target groups,” said Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Chahal. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 India slips 10 slots to 51st in democracy index | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India has slipped 10 places to 51st position among 167 countries on the Democracy Index, a global ranking of the “most and least” democratic countries prepared by the Economist Intelligence Unit, primarily due to an “erosion of civil liberties in the country”. The report said India’s score fell from 7.23 (out of 10) in 2018 to 6.90 in 2019, and attributed India’s “democratic regression” to the abrogation of J&K’s special status, suspension of internet in the newly formed UT and protests over the CAA and the National Register of Citizens. The score of 6.9 is India’s lowest since the inception of the index in 2006. India’s decline coincides with what the report says has been a poor year for democracy globally. India remains well above the 2019 global average of 5.44. India’s highest score was 7.91 in 2014 and since then it has declined. “The Indian government stripped the Jammu & Kashmir state of its special status by repealing two key constitutional provisions granting it powers of autonomy... Furthermore, Article 35A prevented Indian residents from other states from purchasing land or property in J&K... Ahead of the move, the government deployed a large number of troops in J&K, imposed various other security measures and placed local leaders under house arrest, including those with pro-India credentials. The government also restricted internet access in the state,” the report said. On the controversial NRC, the index said, “A separate citizenship registration exercise in Assam... has excluded 1.9 million from the final list of NRC. The vast majority of people excluded from NRC are Muslims. The ruling nationalist BJP says that most of the people excluded from the list are immigrants from Bangladesh, whose government denies this... The new citizenship law has enraged the large Muslim population, stoked communal tensions and generated large protests in major cities.” The report, which has evaluated countries on their civil liberties, political culture, political participation, functioning of government and their electoral processes and pluralism in countries, however, recorded a “steady and significant upward trajectory” in people’s political participation globally, indicating that an increasing number of people are getting involved in the political processes and protesting in comparison to the years before.

" Assam, Tripura litigants hail SC for segregating anti-CAA cases | India News - Times of India","GUWAHATI: Anti-CAA petitioners in Assam and Tripura on Wednesday gave a thumbs up to the Supreme Court’s decision to treat their reservations about the new law as distinct from that of the rest of the country and, therefore, hear those cases separately and on priority. “We have been asking for separate hearings for Assam and the northeast as our issues are entirely different,” Lurinjyoti Gogoi, the general secretary of the All Assam Students Union (Aasu), said. “We have been the worst victims of illegal migration from Bangladesh and cannot afford to take in a single extra illegal migrant — be it a Hindu or Muslim. We believe the Supreme Court will give us justice.” In its petition, Aasu has questioned the logic of considering illegal migrants eligible for citizenship even if they entered the state after the Assam Accord cut-off of March 25, 1971. Congress’s Pradyot Deb Barman, a scion of the Tripura royal family and one of the petitioners against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, said he felt reassured by the apex court taking cognisance of the fact that the issues raised by anti-CAA campaigners in his state and neighbouring Assam were not the same as those echoing elsewhere.

"Kolkata gets second Park Circus, in Ekbalpore | Kolkata News - Times of India","By: Biplab Mondal KOLKATA: Over a hundred women, including homemakers, professionals and students, are staging a sit-in in Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore for the past four days, demanding a rollback of CAA and NRC. The women fasted on Wednesday morning hoping for a Supreme Court intervention and broke their fast in the evening with a promise to carry on their protests till the apex court decides on the issue. Shakil Akhtar, a 66-year-old medical practitioner, and one of the primary organizers, said, “We were born in this country. We have been voting in the elections for the past several years. Kolkata has always been home to all religions and thoughts. So why has this law been passed? This must be reconsidered,” Akhtar said, adding that the collective angst of the people is being reflected in the Nawab Ali Park protest. “We condemn this law and will continue our protests,” said Akhtar, who is the IMA’s Kidderpore branch secretary. Social worker Shaukat Ali Siddiqui said, “The Saheen Bagh protest has encouraged us to take a stand. For many, it is now or never. The protesters here are from every faith and everyone is welcome here. Women are leading the protests and this will continue till the apex court decides on the issue. People from all walks of life have joined our demonstration. This law is ultimately going to harm everybody. The protests will continue.” Iqra Siddiqui, a medical student, joined the protesters on Wednesday. “The politics over religion by the ruling party in the Centre should be condemned.

Delhi assembly elections: RSS to throw its weight behind BJP campaign | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A fortnight before Delhi votes in the assembly election, an army of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers has descended on the city. They plan to hold over 40,000 drawing room meetings before the February 8 polls and discuss subjects like Shaheen Bagh and Jamia protests, Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and Ram Mandir. RSS expects each meeting to attract 15-20 people, who will be asked to stand with the “nationalist forces” in the “test of polarisation”. On the radar are youth, women, socially influential individuals, working class people and Dalits. The campaigning for assembly polls has already entered the final phase. Having announced their candidates, Aam Aadmi Party, Congress and BJP leaders have hit the ground with roadshows, corner meetings, door-to-door campaigns and publicity blitz on social media. The intervention of the RSS army in the all-consuming electioneering has immense significance for BJP. Unlike general elections, assembly polls are fought on local issues, but with Delhi the epicentre of the CAA-NRC protests, the citizenship issue has taken over political and public discourse in recent weeks. The sit-in at Shaheen Bagh, over a month-long now, is being widely discussed among the masses. BJP candidate from Model Town Kapil Mishra has been pushing for an end to the Shaheen Bagh protests, while other saffron leaders have castigated AAP and Congress for “backing” the agitators. An RSS functionary maintained that Delhiites were against the protesters because the new law would grant citizenship to persecuted minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. “Vested interests are supporting the CAA protests in Delhi. We are informing aware citizens that people are being inconvenience by other parties purely for vote-bank benefits,” the functionary said. A 12-point pamphlet will be distributed to 25 lakh households in the capital. It talks about the abolition of triple talaq, construction of National War Memorial, development of Panchteerth in honour of BR Ambedkar, Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, CAA, 10% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for the economically weaker sections and the regularisation of 1,731 illegal colonies in Delhi. The pamphlet also offers the saffron view on the Jamia violence, the alleged hate speech by an MLA (the pamphlet does not name any political party or legislator), the delay in sanction of prosecution in the JNU sedition case, etc. “Vote thoughtfully to push forward the speed of development in Delhi and to stop the conspiring forces from breaking the nation,” the pamphlet urges. While asking for a 100% voters’ turnout, the paper asks people to keep in mind these issues when they reach the polling booths. RSS has an extensive network of workers in almost all colonies of Delhi and they will be used for the awareness exercise. RSS Delhi unit spokesperson Rajeev Tuli, however, explained that the outreach workers will avoid discussing issues pertaining to the city because that is the job of BJP. The awareness exercise is likely to energise BJP’s campaign as the party attempts to dislodge AAP and return to power in Delhi after 27 years.

Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, however, threw down the gauntlet to BJP for a debate on ‘development’. Addressing a rally in Lucknow on Tuesday, Shah had challenged Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav to debate CAA with him. Putting out a tweet, Mayawati said: “BSP accepts Centre’s challenge to debate the controversial CAA/NRC/NPC, against which there have been protests across the country, especially by women and youth. The debate can take place on any platform and anywhere.” On his part, Owaisi said: “People from the media informed me that the Union home minister is ready to debate CAA with Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee. I told them I am there, right? Let him debate with the dariwala (bearded man) first.” Talking to reporters in Hyderabad on Wednesday, he said, “Call Asaduddin Owaisi and Union home minister, and let’s debate. Let’s debate everything, including CAA, NPR (National Population Register) and NRC (National Register of Citizens).” Akhilesh, however, did not mention CAA while challenging BJP for a debate. “Let them determine the place and platform, we are ready.

"CAA will not pose a threat to Sonia or Siddaramaiah’s citizenship, says BJP general secy | Hubballi News - Times of India","Hubballi: In a tongue-in cheek remark at some of the senior members of the Congress, who have been opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), general secretary of the Karnataka BJP and MLC N Ravikumar on Wednesday sought to clear the air about the objectives of the Act. “The CAA is not meant to mete out injustice to any community. I am willing to swear by the seer of the Hubballi Siddharoodh Mutt to this effect. The Act is neither anti-constitutional nor aimed at targeting minorities. The Congress is misguiding the people about its purpose, while Left-leaning parties are creating confusion in the minds of the people about this for their political gains. Let me assure you that it will not threaten the claims to Indian citizenship of Congress leaders including Sonia Gandhi, CM Ibrahim or Siddaramaiah,” said Ravikumar. The BJP functionary exuded confidence of the campaign launched against CAA having no lasting impact in the minds of the people. Meanwhile, Ravikumar said that the state BJP had launched another campaign to express their solidarity with the Centre on the CAA. “On January 26, our workers will hoist the tricolour at 58,000 polling booths. The presidents of the booth-level committees will post a letter each to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expressing their support to CAA. This letter will contain the signatures of all those participating in the ceremony on Republic Day in their respective constituencies,” said the MLC. Ravikumar added that BJP workers would read out excerpts from the book, ‘Utta Batteyalli Bandavaru’, which chronicled the abject condition of refugees in their camps. “As many as 12 lakh people have given a missed call, confirming their support for CAA, while 6.7 lakh people have signed a document affirming the same. We are confident that the total number of those who will openly express their support for CAA will cross one crore by this Republic Day,” he added. Mahesh Tenginakai, also general secretary of the Karnataka BJP, appreciated Mangaluru police for their swift action in defusing the situation after a crude bomb was found at the Mangaluru Airport. “The accused has surrendered, and regardless of who he is, his actions are to be condemned. We urge the government to prosecute him,” said Tenginakai, denying reports of the man’s allegations to BJP or any of its affiliate organisations. Both the general secretaries took exception with former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy’s remarks about the whole exercise having been a mock-drill. “Kumaraswamy ought not to have made such statements, being a former CM. Such remarks will only serve to demotivate the police force,” they said. ‘BJP does not encourage anti-Muslim statements’ On remarks made by party colleagues, Uttara Kannada MP Anantkumar Hegde and MLA Renukacharya, wherein they have targetted Muslims, Ravikumar said, “Hegde tendered apology for his remarks in the Parliament. State leaders in the BJP have asked Renukacharya to refrain from making such remarks. BJP does not encourage such statements.

Muslim outfits to strengthen stir against Citizenship Act | Kozhikode News - Times of India,"Kozhikode: Expressing dissatisfaction over the Supreme Court’s decision on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Muslim organizations have called for the strengthening of the agitations against the law.

The party will continue its fight against the law without any compromise, Majeed said in a statement. Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar said it is known that almost 75% of the people in the country are against CAA. “I wonder why a decision in the case was postponed.

Saying CAA won’t be rolled back is dictatorship: Nath salvo from Davos | Bhopal News - Times of India,"Bhopal: Discussing India’s economic growth at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Wednesday, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath termed as “dictatorship” remarks by home minister Amit Shah that the new citizenship law won’t be rolled back at any cost, irrespective of the protests. The buzz around India is subdued at the WEF this time, Nath said.“Public is supreme in democracy. It is the responsibility of the government to obey public opinion. If people are on the streets in protest against CAA, then you should reconsider this law, discuss it with everyone. But you say that this law will not be rolled back in any circumstances; then, it is just dictatorship,” Nath said in Davos in reaction to Shah’s vow at a rally in UP on Tuesday that CAA “won’t be rolled back at any cost, irrespective of the protests”.Nath sees this as “autocracy”, and remarked that anti-CAA protests have hurt Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image too. “The PM talks of cooperative federalism. But, states are not consulted before big decisions like CAA are rolled out. The youth of India are frustrated with PM Modi and this frustration will keep showing up in different ways. Nationwide CAA protests have hurt PM’s image,” the chief minister retweeted his statement after talking to reporters in Davos on Wednesday.Nath, a regular at WEF for nearly 40 years, tweeted: “In all the decades that I have been coming to Davos for WEF, I have never seen the buzz around India so subdued. Everyone I meet is asking about the falling economy and growing social unrest. The central government is to blame for this mess.”On January 13, Nath had questioned the need for the new citizenship law. “Is CAA necessary at a time when the country is facing an economic slowdown?” Nath had asked. “Is there a war going on? Are a large number of refugees seeking shelter in our country? CAA is only to divert the attention of public from crucial matters pertaining to economy, jobs and farm crisis. How long can BJP mislead people? There is an urgent need for improving our economic condition.

HC refuses to hear PIL against CAA | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Nagpur: Refusing to hear petition challenging Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday granted liberty to the petitioner to approach Supreme Court which is hearing over 100 petitions on the same issue. The public interest litigation (PIL) was listed before a division bench comprising Justice Ravi Deshpande and Justice Amit Borkar. “Assistant solicitor general and additional government pleader have brought to our notice that about 100 petitions have been filed before the apex court challenging the validity of the CAA, which is the subject matter of the challenge in the present writ. All such matters are being heard by the apex court. In view of this, on the ground of propriety, we refuse to entertain this PIL,” the bench said. Petitioner Urmila Kowe from Bhandara had filed the PIL through counsel Ashwin Ingole stating that she was espousing the cause of the citizens of India, who are not in a position to arrange for the necessary documents in support of their citizenship. According to her, the CAA is a colourable legislation that violated the secular nature of the Constitution. “It’s discriminatory and violates the basic structure of the Constitution of India,” said Kowe. She further contended that CAA is class legislation harping on religious identity of an individual. It also contravened the principles of secularism which have been recognized by the apex court in many cases. “The controversial amendment to the Citizenship Act manifestly and arbitrarily violates the fundamental rights enshrined in the statute,” she said. Kowe argued that the amendment covered only a class of minorities from specific countries sharing borders with India from where there has been trans-border migration and it overlooked other reportedly persecuted religious minorities. “The legislation also doesn’t cover ethnic and linguistic issues of Tamils of Sri Lanka and that the Act is in contravention of India’s international obligations under Article 14 and 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which the country is a signatory,” she said.

Group initiates letter drive to CJI over CAA | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Nagpur: Even as the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising chief justice of India Sharad Bobde on Wednesday refused to pass an interim stay on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), a group of citizens have initiated a letter-drive which they want the apex court to treat as a public interest litigation (PIL). Mohammad Asjad, an imam at a Wanjara masjid, said they have been continuously posting the letter drafted by a SC lawyers’ association. “We got a common letter drafted by our legal friends. In our area, some of us are going door-to-door to hand over photocopies of the letter asking people to send them to the CJI,” he said. Asjad said when some people show reluctance citing lack of time, they get the signature, name and mobile phone number to post the letters themselves. He claimed over 7000 letters have been sent so far from various parts of the city. “Our constitution is in danger and it is our duty to protect it in whichever way possible. No harm should happen to what Babasaheb Ambedkar formulated years ago,” he said.

R-Day Constitution celebration plans | Kolkata News - Times of India,"Kolkata: A human chain will be formed from the north to the south of the city on Republic Day to uphold the values of the Constitution. A meeting was held by United Interfaith Foundation India (UIFI) on Wednesday to finalize plans for it. Without directly going into the issue of the current narrative of protests against CAA and NRC that has rocked the country, the foundation members said the human chain will be a symbol of unity, equality and solidarity that the Constitution guarantees to the people of the country. In its 70th year, it was once again time to remind everybody what the Constitution stands for. The chain will start from Golpark and end at the Shyambazar five-point crossing. People will stand on one side of the road holding hands to form the chain that will go straight up to Park Circus and then on to Mullickbazar, cross Sealdah, Rajabazar and end at Shyambazar. “It is time to celebrate the Constitution and to celebrate the values of equality and brotherhood it upholds,” said Father Thomas D’Souza, the chairperson of the foundation. The UIFI is an organization consisting of religious leaders and community heads from every denomination, who have come together to take forward the interfaith dialogue for promoting humanity, peace, harmony and brotherhood. The chain will be formed at noon for 10 minutes. “The Constitution will be read out in several languages at vantage points,” said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, general secretary of the foundation.

"Supreme Court verdict on CAA: No SC stay on CAA, process of NPR; govt has 4 weeks to respond | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to stay the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, declining to take note of protests and anti-CAA resolutions by the Kerala and Punjab assemblies, and brushed aside repeated pleas for deferment of processes relating to the National Population Register (NPR) as a corollary of CAA. The court said the petitions would be heard by a five-judge Constitution bench and granted the Centre four weeks to file a comprehensive response. This means the hearing will not start before February 22. A bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna had a tough time dealing with a record 144 petitions represented by nearly 300 advocates leading to a packed courtroom and a cacophonous atmosphere. It took CJI Bobde close to 15 minutes to bring order for a string of renowned advocates — Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan, Vikas Singh, K V Vishwanathan, Shyam Divan, Indira Jaising, Jayant Bhushan, Prashant Bhushan, Colin Gonsalves and Sajan Poovaayya — to argue against CAA and NPR. Importantly, the bench agreed with submissions that petitions from Assam and Tripura should be heard separately from the larger clutch as they were opposing CAA on a ground very different from other parts of the country. They said the people of Assam were agitated as the CAA abruptly changed the cut-off date for grant of citizenship to illegal migrants from Bangladesh from March 24, 1971 (as fixed in the 1985 Assam Accord) to December 31, 2014 in the CAA. The court said these petitions would be heard after two weeks. The bench’s pronouncement, “we are not going to grant any ex parte stay”, saw Sibal arguing that the process for implementation of NPR would start in April and it would be in the interest of justice if the court asked the government to defer it for two months. However, attorney general K K Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “That kind of interim order will be as good as a stay order.” Sibal attempted several indirect pleas to get at least the NPR process deferred, but the CJI-led bench said, “If the law is prevented from being implemented or ordered to be deferred, it is as good as granting a stay. We are not going to do any such thing without hearing arguments on the requirement of stay. Arguments for interim order will also be heard by the Constitution bench.” When Sibal persisted, the CJI said, “The (CAA) law will always remain subject to the outcome of the petitions.” Explaining why it was not considering arguments on interim stay at this stage, the CJI said, “The problem is that petitions are continuously being filed. If the court passes an interim order on one batch of petitions, then a fresh batch will file petitions seeking review of it on the ground that they were not heard. And it will go on and on in a vicious cycle.” Sibal said the importance of the issue raised by the petitions and its consequences for the nation warranted hearing by a five judge Constitution bench. The bench agreed and said, “Why not? Maybe all the petitions should be referred to a five-judge bench.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Men sleeping under quilt; women, kids pushed forward to protest against CAA: Yogi | India News - Times of India","KANPUR: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday targeted the women-led protests against the amended Citizenship Act, alleging that while the men are sleeping under the quilt at the comfort of their homes, they have pushed their women and children forward to stage sit-ins. Addressing a rally in support of the CAA in Saket Nagar here, Adityanath said, ""Now these people (anti-CAA protesters) do not have courage to participate in the protests themselves. They know that if they indulge in vandalism, their property will be seized."" Anti-CAA protests led by women have been reported from different parts of the country with the one at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh occupying the centre stage. ""Now what have they done? They started making the women of their houses sit at roads. The children have been made to sit also. It's such a big crime that the men are sleeping under the quilt, while the women folks have been pushed forward and made to sit at various roads. It is shameful,"" alleged the chief minister, who had earlier warned protesters indulging in vandalism in his state that their properties would be seized and auctioned to compensate for the damages. On Wednesday, he also slammed the Congress, the Samajwadi Party and Left parties accusing them of doing politics at the cost of the nation. ""They are resorting to the tactic of pushing the women forward. Those who do not know what the CAA is are staging sit-ins,"" he alleged. ""If you go and ask anyone as to why are they sitting on a 'dharna', they will say that the men of the house feel that they have become so incompetent that they cannot do anything, so they want the women to go and sit on the 'dharna'. ""For them, the country is not important. The Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis are not important. Now, for the Congress, even the Christians are not important. And, they have said the protests will continue against the CAA until the ISI agents are given entry in India. This is a shameful statement made by Congress leaders,"" he alleged.

We are eager to explain to SC our view on how anti-Constitution CAA is: Shaheen Bagh protesters | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: With the Supreme Court giving four weeks to the Centre to respond to pleas challenging the CAA, protesters at Shaheen Bagh here on Wednesday said they too are eager to put forth before the judges their point of view on how unconstitutional the amended citizenship law is. Tasmin Bano, a resident of Shaheen Bagh who has been coming to the demonstration site along with her one-year-old daughter Umema since the protest began more than a month back, said they will not move from the spot unless the CAA is revoked. ""We have heard the Supreme Court has given time to the Centre and till that time they would not stay the CAA. We are also ready to prove our version and can tell the court how unconstitutional this law is,"" Bano said. Alexender Fleming, a protester who was holding the Bible, said listening to only one party is not the way of solving an issue. ""They (the other petitioners) also need to be heard and we are ready for that. We have full faith that we will prove our stand on how anti-constitution this law is,"" he said. The Supreme Court made it clear on Wednesday that it would not stay the operation of the Citizenship Amendment Act without hearing the Centre and said a five-judge Constitution bench would decide the validity of the amended law. Seeking response of the central government in four weeks on a batch of pleas challenging the CAA, the top court also restrained high courts in the country from proceedings with pending petitions on the issue. Tanvir Akhtar, a software developer who comes to the site everyday after work, said there are already 100 Shaheen Baghs across the country. ""Till the time the law is not revoked, the protesters will not move an inch,"" he said. Zeba Qasi, another protester and local, alleged that the government is trying to ""demean"" this protest. ""We all are here. We have come here for our rights and want the government to amend this. We have heard that 'Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai, hum sab hai bhai bhai'. If you will remove Muslim from this, then the poem will not be completed,"" she said, rebutting the charges that protesters at Shaheen Bagh are being paid.

" Nobody can dare touch any Indian Muslim, says Rajnath on apprehensions about CAA-NRC-NPR | India News - Times of India","MEERUT: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said that no one can dare touch any Indian Muslim, as he sought to dispel apprehensions that the community will be targeted if NPR and NRC are bought in, and cautioned the people against forces which were trying to ""create a divide"" on religious lines over the CAA. Addressing a rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Shatabdi Nagar here, the BJP leader said religious minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh were living a ""life of misery"" and India has fulfilled its ""moral duty"" by enacting the CAA. He also questioned those opposing the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), stressing that they were mooted much before the BJP government was formed, and rejected claims that Muslims will be ""banished"" under these exercises. ""There has been no discussion on NRC. But, suppose a country wants to create a national register of citizens, why should there be an objection to it. Shouldn't there be a document for people to seek benefits of government schemes,"" he asked the crowd. ""... But they say you are making NPR register and then you will bring NRC and banish all Muslims. I want to tell Muslims present here that nobody can dare touch any Muslim who is an Indian citizen. I want to assure you. If anyone has any complaint they can come to us... we will stand with that Muslim citizen,"" the minister said. Singh said India was partitioned on the basis of religion and even Mahatma Gandhi wanted that Indian government should be sensitive towards minorities of neighbouring countries if they face religious persecution there. He had said such people should be given citizenship. ""We have done what Gandhiji had said (by bringing CAA). Did we commit a crime?"" ""There are certain forces who want to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims on the issue of CAA. These forces have vested interests in creating a rift between the communities.

""They are trying to defame our party as if we are discriminating on the basis of religion. Only the people can given a befitting response to them and you are doing it."" Singh said the NDA had prepared the citizenship legislation in its first tenure, but it could not be enacted. ""We had promised to give citizenship to minorities facing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan and PM Modi has fulfilled that commitment,"" he said. He said the BJP ""never divides the people of the country for political gains"" and wants to do politics by winning people's hearts and fulfilling all its promises. ""I was given the responsibility to prepare the BJP's manifesto for the 2019 (Lok Sabha) elections. Within seven months of being elected, the BJP has been rapidly fulfilling its promises,"" he said. ""I want to assure the people of India that our party will deliver on whatever it promises. We do not want to cheat the people,"" he said. Earlier speaking at the NCC Republic Day Camp in Delhi, Singh said Indian values consider all religions equal and that is why the country is secular and never became a theocratic state like Pakistan. ""We (India) said we would not discriminate among religions. Why did we do that? Our neighbouring country has declared that their state has a religion. They have declared themselves a theocratic state. We didn't declare so."" ""Even America is a theocratic country. India is not a theocratic country. Why? Because our saints and seers did not just consider the people living within our borders as part of the family, but called everyone living in the world as one family,"" the minister said. The CAA allows easier citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who came to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh before 2015 to escape religious persecution there.

 CAA: Amarinder sends Sukhbir 'Mein Kampf’ | India News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: Questioning Sukhbir Singh Badal’s logic in interpreting his criticism of SAD’s stand on CAA as being ‘anti-Sikh’, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday sent the Akali chief a copy of ‘Mein Kampf’, advising him to read Adolf Hitler’s autobiography to understand the “dangerous implications” of the “unconstitutional” legislation passed by the Centre. Given the current attempts by the Centre to replicate Hitler’s agenda is India, it was important for the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders to read the former German Chancellor’s autobiography before coming out with irrational reactions on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), said Amarinder. In the letter to Sukhbir, Amarinder recalled that, during the last Vidhan Sabha session, he had promised to send the Shiromani Akali Dal copies of Hitler’s Mein Kampf, which in English translates to 'My Struggles.’ “These were his (Hitler’s) beliefs which he sold to the German people In his rise to power, which later became his governments policy, when his Nazi party assumed office,” wrote Amarinder, adding that “Apart from destroying Germany in World War 2, to fulfil his territorial ambition, from the time he assumed office in 1933 to the end of the war in 1945, his purification of the German race by his ethnic cleansing, led initially to the removal of his main opposition, the communist parties, followed by persecution of the intellectuals, and finally to the extermination of the Jews.” “Read the book, as one always learns from history. The world has changed, and our television and other media are powerful, and certainly different to that of Germany in the thirties under Joseph Goebbels. Nevertheless, the talk of camps and a national register to eliminate the Muslim and Jewish communities is ominous,” Amarinder. Meanwhile, taking the SAD president head-on over yesterday’s remarks, the Chief Minister, in a statement here, also asked him to explain how his (Amarinder’s) demand for the Akalis to quit NDA over CAA amounted to ""subservience"" to the Gandhi family. “Or are you trying to say that the lakhs of people out on the streets to protest against CAA are doing so simply out of subservience to the Gandhi family,” he asked Sukhbir. Retorting to Sukhbir’s ‘saving his chair’ jab, the Chief Minister said his chair was quite secure. “But apparently, you are worried about your wife Harsimrat’s chair in the union cabinet and do not want her to lose that at any cost,” quipped Amarinder.  “I fail to understand what clarification Sukhbir wants from me on this count? Can he point out a single instance or statement where I have opposed giving relief to persecuted Sikhs or, for that matter, to persecuted Hindus or Buddhists? ” asked Amarinder.

The protest against the CAA at Shaheen Bagh in southeast Delhi has been going on for over a month. The protest began immediately after violent anti-CAA protest in Jamia Nagar on December 15 last year.

" Not only SP, but those who 'understand soul' of country opposing CAA: Akhilesh Yadav | India News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Those who ""understand the soul"" of the country are opposed to the amended citizenship law, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said on Wednesday, accusing the BJP of discriminating on the basis of religion. He also alleged that the BJP is playing with the Constitution as it has majority in Lok Sabha. The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said as far as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is concerned, ""not only the Samajwadi Party (SP) but all those who understand the soul of the country are opposing it"". ""I am glad that women have taken the lead and youth are protesting in large numbers"": Yadav told reporters after garlanding a statue of SP leader Janeshwar Mishra at a park here on his death anniversary. Mahatma Gandhi and Dr B R Ambedkar were against discrimination, the SP chief said as he accused the BJP of suppressing the voice of the people. ""Discrimination on the basis of religion is being done by the BJP and every Indian is against it. Will they (the BJP) kill the soul of the country and create fissures in society for votes,"" he said. ""With majority they (the BJP) cannot suppress the voice of the common people. Democracy will be strengthened by the voice of the people,"" Yadav said. Accusing Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath of using words like ""thok diya jayega"" in his speeches, he said, ""This cannot be the language of a politician"".

""I ask them to fix a place or a forum, with their favourite channels and anchors, for a debate on development. We Samajwadis are ready for it. Why did they not want to debate on the state of the economy and demonetisation,"" Yadav said. Since the BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh, it has failed to protect farmers, he said. On Shah advising him to ""remain silent"", Yadav said, ""They don't need big officers. Direct a constable, ask him to put 'ganja' (cannabis) in my pocket and send me to jail.""  The SP leader said this citing the case of a Kushinagar-based painter, who was allegedly sent to jail in similar way by police. He alleged that Uttar Pradesh had the highest number of custodial deaths, fake encounters and notices from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). On being asked about allegations that the SP was speaking the language of India's enemies, Yadav said, ""I have never met (Pakistan prime minister) Imran Khan. If you talk about Pakistan, I want to tell that we Samajwadis are 'Bhartiya'"". Asked about the BJP's allegations that money is being paid to women protesting against the CAA, he said, ""BJP men used to spend money to bring crowds to their rallies. Those who have gathered to protest against the CAA came on their own."" Reiterating support for a caste census, Yadav said that ""thousands of crores of rupees are going to be spent on the census, then why caste data cannot come out"".

" Before CAA, string of government orders made it impossible for Muslim migrants to get Indian citizenship | India News - Times of India","BENGALURU/MUMBAI: Even as protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act rage across India, a review of government orders (GO) by TOI shows that the government has been steadily placing hurdles in the way of Muslims seeking Indian citizenship since December 2014. The most significant GO is the October 22, 2018 amendment to the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950 and Foreigners Act, 1946, discriminating against Muslims and atheists for the grant of long-term visas (LTVs). The changed LTV regulations say, “Only members of minority communities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, are eligible to apply for long-term visas.” Under the Citizenship Act of 1955, a residential permit, or LTV, is one of the main requirements for getting Indian citizenship through naturalisation. Denying LTVs to Muslim migrants, in effect, filters them out of the process from the start, regardless of the passage of the CAA this year. Lawyers have now moved the Supreme Court seeking the repeal of the CAA and some of these government orders. The first hearing on the plea is scheduled in the Supreme Court on January 22. The Joint Forum Against NRC has been working on this since 2016, when the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) was introduced, said activist Prasenjit Bose, who has challenged the CAA and some of these government orders in the SC. “We realised that the foundation for the CAA was laid long before it was enacted,” Bose said. Lawyers say the orders discriminate on grounds of religion and should be deemed unconstitutional as per Article 14 of the Constitution. “The LTV rules could have been separately challenged as being ultra vires the act,” said Sanjay Hegde, a Supreme Court lawyer. “Amendments to the Citizenship Act now seek to put parliamentary approval on what prima facie appear to be discriminatory rules. The mere existence of earlier discriminatory rules does not in any manner validate discriminatory legislation,” Hegde said. “As human rights workers, we feel the government orders of 2015 and 2017 amending the passport rules are violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. We demand that they be immediately repealed or amended to include all migrants, irrespective of religion, from all neighbouring countries,” said Teesta Setalvad, activist with the Centre for Justice and Peace. Emails sent to officials at the ministry of external affairs remained unanswered. However, an MEA official who declined to be named said, “No one should feel jealous or angry towards refugees. These are people fleeing extreme conditions of violence and unrest, so the government has granted a special exemption to them.” Lawyers say the government’s moves are a human rights issue more than a legal one. “When it comes to the CAA-NRC-NPR, they have already said Aadhaar, voter ID cards and passports are not proof of citizenship, only ancestry is. When you place the burden of proof on a country with more than 270 million people living below the poverty line, it would be fair to surmise many do not have such documents,” said Nikhil Narendran, a lawyer. Narendran pointed out the government orders are also problematic as they recognise only religious persecution of specific communities. “Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar also face religious persecution, as do atheists in Bangladesh. There are other forms of persecution, such as ethnic persecution that Sri Lankan Tamils faced. There’s also the question of linguistic persecution, which led to Bengali-speaking Muslims fleeing to Assam in large numbers, giving rise to the current NRC exercise there.” Activists also warn of a human rights crisis on India’s borders. “Religious discrimination could turn into other rights violations. What happens to the 19 lakh people already declared non-citizens in Assam,” Bose asked. “Who is a citizen, who is not, who can be allowed to enter, who is barred? Would families be allowed to live together in detention camps? Would children be separated from parents? The government wants us to worry over our future with such questions, without creating any solution for the problems the Assam NRC has caused,” Bose said.

In view of the “seriousness of the issue and its impact on children”, NCPCR asked the DM to issue necessary directions to district child protection officer along with police child welfare officer to identify these children and arrange counselling sessions for them and also for their parents, if deemed fit. “If required, children may be produced before the Child Welfare Committee also,” it said.

"Amit Shah: Let them protest, but we won't budge on CAA | India News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday sharpened his   attack on anti-CAA protesters   , saying the government was not scared of agitation, and firmly ruled out the repeal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Raking up the JNU violence at a rally in Lucknow, Shah said those who raise anti-India slogans would be put behind bars.  "" Jinko virodh karna hai ka re... hum CAA wapas nahi lene wale hain. Hum virodh se darne wale nahi hain, hamara toh janm hi virodh mein hua hai (Let me say it loud and clear that whoever wants to protest can protest. We will not revoke CAA. We are not scared of agitation, we were born of it),"" Shah said at a huge rally in the UP capital, his first after relinquishing the post of BJP president. Amit Shah attacks Congress, calls CAA critics 'anti-dalits'Shah's announcement at the government's ""outreach programme"" on the new citizenship law came against the backdrop of raging protests across the nation, including Lucknow, Kanpur and Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh.  The home minister questioned civil society and human rights organisations on their silence on atrocities on minorities in neighbouring countries. ""I met migrants and saw tears in their eyes. They have been given an opportunity to start a new journey by our government,"" he said. Challenging opposition party chiefs Mamata Banerjee, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati for a debate on CAA, Shah said, ""I dare you to show me any clause in the law that talks about stripping anyone's citizenship. They are misguiding people as they are blinded by vote-bank politics.""  The home minister squarely blamed Congress for the Partition and dividing the country along religious lines. ""Minority women in the neighboring countries were either raped or forcibly converted,"" he said, reiterating the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was not about taking away citizenship, but giving it. He accused SP chief Akhilesh Yadav of speaking against the country. ""Those who speak against the interests of India will be sent to jail. You are allowed to speak against our party, not against the country,"" he said. Shah also accused the opposition of speaking the language of Pakistan on a host of issues.

"Want CAA to benefit Sikhs, don’t you: SAD chief asks Capt | Chandigarh News - Times of India","Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday asked Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to clarify if he was not in favour of giving relief to persecuted Sikhs under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and whether he wanted the entire citizenship law to be rejected. Under CAA, Sikhs are among the persecuted minorities of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Aghanistan for whom terms for Indian citizenship have been eased. Sukhbir said by opposing CAA, the chief minister was opposing the relief given to Sikhs under the act. “This does nothing except fulfilling the anti-Sikh agenda of the Congress party. If Capt Amarinder is really serious about giving relief to persecuted Sikhs in Pakistan and Afghanistan, he should join SAD in seeking the inclusion of Muslims in it. Recent figures of the Pakistan human rights (body) states that 1,000 Hindu/Sikh girls were abducted and forcibly married to Muslim men,” said Sukhbir, whose statement came in response to the Congress-majority Punjab assembly passing a resolution on Friday to demand the repeal of CAA. The former deputy CM said SAD voted in favour of CAA to save persecuted Sikhs. “We, however, recorded our dissent, with me demanding that Muslims be included in the new act. We have stuck to our stand and have preferred to forsake contesting the Delhi assembly elections rather than give up on our principled stand on this issue,” he said. The SAD president said his party did not need any lessons on how to react to a situation from Amarinder, who he described as a “failed chief minister”. He said SAD would continue its struggle to get Muslims included in CAA and use the office of Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal for the purpose. Sukhbir said the party had simultaneously made it clear that it was against the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Reacting to Punjab CM’s statement, Sukhbir said it was a fact that the Sikh community of Delhi had put forward a demand to contest from eight seats in the forthcoming assembly elections. “The party considered the demand, but decided that it must champion the cause of all minorities and not only members of its own community,” he said.

"Break alliance with BJP if you’re really against CAA, Capt to SAD | Chandigarh News - Times of India","Chandigarh: Ridiculing SAD’s claim that it had chosen not to contest the Delhi assembly polls due to differences with BJP over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said he challenged the Akalis to quit the alliance at the Centre to prove their sincerity. He said SAD was party to passing of the legislation in both the Houses of Parliament. “Why don’t you (Akalis) walk the talk and show the people of India that you really stand against the divisive and destructive CAA?” said Capt Amarinder, urging the SAD minister in the Union cabinet to immediately resign in support of their stated stand on the “controversial” legislation.  “If you found the CAA to be anti-Muslim, why did you support and pass the legislation in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha,” he asked the Akalis, adding that the vociferous support extended by SAD in Parliament was a matter of record. Pointing out that Delhi was the second state, after Haryana, where the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had decided not to go with their ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the chief minister said the decision was clearly motivated by political compulsions as the SAD had evidently realised it had no ground support and could not win even a single seat in the national capital. Or perhaps, BJP was not ready to give them what they wanted in terms of seats, prompting them to look for a graceful way out of the situation, he added. Taking a dig at the SAD leadership, including party chief Sukhbir Badal and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, over their spate of “contradictory and conflicting statements on CAA”, he said Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s claim that the party had been under pressure to review its stand on CAA was ludicrous, to say the least. Capt Amarinder advised the Akalis to stop trying to befool the people with their bogus claims on such a sensitive and critical issue. “You cannot expect people to believe that you are serious when you continue to stand with the BJP in Parliament and in the government at the Centre,” he added.

"Kanhaiya Kumar asks Bihar CM to follow Kerala, oppose CAA | Patna News - Times of India","GAYA: Former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Tuesday asked CM Nitish Kumar to call a special session of the legislature and pass a resolution against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on the line of Kerala or be ready to face public ire. Addressing a public meeting at Gaya Gandhi Maidan, Kanhaiya exhorted Nitish to shed ambiguity and be counted among the saviours and not the saboteurs of the Constitution. He was in the town to attend the CPI’s state unit meeting. Kanhaiya said the CAA-NPR-NRC was not anti-Muslim but anti-poor as it will affect all the undocumented and ill documented people irrespective of religion, caste and creed. The status of documentation in our country is very poor and as such a very large number of people are vulnerable to losing their nationality, not because they are not Indians but because they cannot prove their citizenship status, he said. The CPI leader also announced to undertake a ‘Samvidhan Yatra’ from Champaran to Patna on January 30, the day Mahatma Gandhi was martyred. Ridiculing Union home minister Amit Shah’s reported claim of being a ‘bania’, Kanhaiya said the latter has brought discredit to the community respected all over the country for its computing skills. Even the dullest of bania knows that 15 can never equal 85 and still he is trying to make 85 look weak in comparison to 15. He was referring to the ratio of non-Muslim and Muslim population in the country and the BJP’s attempt to play up the apprehensions of the majority community. Cautioning those who were nursing the illusion that NRC would not affect them, Kanhaiya advised such people to visit Assam where 15 lakh of the 19 lakh stateless people were non-Muslims. He also asked people not to call UP CM as Yogi. Yogis denounce power, not usurp it, Kanhaiya said. Earlier, trade union leader Amarjeet Kaur said that public sector undertakings, including BSNL, were bleeding white to make private players ‘obese’. Later in the evening, Kanhaiya visited Shanti Bagh area of the town where the 24X7 anti-CAA protest entered the 24th day. Kanhaiya expressed solidarity with the protesting men, women and children and said their fight will not go in vain. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

BJP’s Hills ally opposes CAA &amp; NRC | Kolkata News - Times of India,"Darjeeling: For the first time, the Gorkha National Liberation Front, BJP’s ally in the Hills, expressed its disapproval of the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Tuesday. The party said that in their present forms, both will affect the Gorkha community. The GNLF had earlier refrained from clarifying its stand on the two issues, against which Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will organize a rally in Darjeeling on Wednesday. The Hills party is also against the National Population Register (NPR), which opposition parties consider a precursor to NRC. “The gazette notification on CAA and NPR shows that Gorkhas will definitely be affected if both of them are implemented in their present forms. According to the annual report of the ministry of home affairs, NPR is the first step towards NRC,” said GNLF spokesperson Mahendra Chhetri. He added, “One of the documents required to prove citizenship is the birth certificate of the parents. Not many Gorkhas have this. This will only create panic in the Gorkha community.” GNLF said it believed that putting Darjeeling under the Sixth Schedule was the only way to counter this. “When CAA was formed, the Union home minister in his speech had said that nothing in this section shall apply to the tribal areas of Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Mizoram, which are included in the Sixth Schedule,” he said. Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Binoy Tamang faction) welcomed GNLF’s move. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

I never heard the word Hindu terrorism,” Karjol said in Mysuru. Meanwhile, speaking at a Citizenship (Amendment) Act awareness campaign in Davanagere, Renukacharya, who is also political secretary to the CM, said, “There are some anti-nationals who give fatwas from masjids.

It is impossible.’’ He also said, “Davanagere sitting MP GM Siddeshwar and I got only 500 to 600 Muslim votes in the last three elections. Even then, without discrimination, we gave lakhs of rupees in grants to shaadi mahals and masjids. (Chief minister BS) Yediyurappa, too, has given over Rs 250 crore in grants, but why do Muslims still hate BJP? It is the most unfortunate thing.” Recently, Ballari City MLA Somashekar Reddy of BJP had made similar controversial remarks at a pro-CAA rally, asking those opposing CAA to think of the “consequences”. “We are 80%, you are 17 %.

Night vigil to send CAA message to SC | Kolkata News - Times of India,"Kolkata: A day before Supreme Court hears the petition that argues that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is unconstitutional, protesters started another sit-in in the heart of the city on SN Banerjee Road. Hundreds of women have already been sitting at Park Circus Maidan, which has now come to be known as Kolkata’s Shaheen Bag, since January 7. They have been demanding a total rollback of the CAA. Protesters at both the venues said they will do an all-night vigil, sing patriotic songs and recite the preamble to the Constitution the whole night, hoping a for a favourable response. Several mass organisations under the Joint Forum Against NRC had issued a call to assemble at Ramlila Ground in Moulali and head to Esplanade for a sit-in to protest against CAA and proposed NRC and NPR. Almost everybody at the protests rally said it was important to hit the streets to send a message to the judiciary about the mood of the country. “It is now or never. It is important to be out on the streets to send a message that the citizens have not accepted CAA, which the government has imposed on them. A law that may impact millions of people has been formulated and passed without consulting the citizens of the country,” said Bimal Ghosh, a member of the All Bengal Anti-NRC Citizens’ Committee. Another protester said the uprising of the people against CAA and NRC is not only a warning to the central government but it also has a message for the opposition parties. “The opposition has failed to unite and defend the rights of the citizens. Things have come to such a pass that ordinary citizens decided to hit the streets,” said Mohammad Hasan, a businessman who has been joining protests since Parliament passed CAA last month. At Park Circus Maidan, protesting women said the intervening night between Tuesday and Wednesday could be the longest for them and the most crucial. “A lot depends on what Supreme Court says on Wednesday. We are hoping the judiciary has been keeping an eye on protests across the country and brutalities on people who have been protesting peacefully in different parts of the country,” said Saira Jabeen, a homemaker from Rifle Range Road in Park Circus.

While the community members claimed that they had sought prior permission from departments concerned, police said that the city has a designated ‘dharna sthal’ and whoever wants to protest should sit at that spot and not at any random location. On the lines of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, hundreds of Muslim men, women and children, on the call of local ward corporator, Congress’s Itaat Khan, gathered at MDDA Park situated at city’s Nehru colony on Tuesday morning.

However, barely 30 minutes into the protest, police teams reached the park and asked them to call off the dharna immediately saying that they were not given permission to organise such a large gathering. Speaking to TOI, Itaat Khan said that they had sought permission from various departments. “We had approached the district administration, the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority and even police but we were denied permission citing one reason or the either.

Khan added that they had informed the administration that they would be holding a peaceful protest from 10 am to 5 pm every day. He said, “The administration is not ready to give us place anywhere and I was even threatened by the people in power. This is nothing but misuse of power by the government. Also, we were protesting at one side of the park and there was enough space for children to play.” Meanwhile, SP city Shweta Chaubey told TOI that the protesters who had gathered at Reetha Mandi were already informed that they were not supposed to protest at any random location.

No constitutional obligation to secure guv’s nod: Minister | Kozhikode News - Times of India,"Kozhikode: Law minister A K Balan said that the state government has no constitutional obligation to secure permission from the governor before challenging the validity of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the Supreme Court under Article 131 of the Constitution. Addressing the media in Wayanad on Tuesday, he said that nowhere is it said in Article 131 of the Constitution that prior approval of the governor is needed for filing a case in the Supreme Court. “Also, permission of the governor is not required for passing a resolution in the state assembly on the matter. Only the approval of the assembly speaker is required for that. Even constitutional experts like former governor Justice P Sathasivam has said that it is not mandatory to inform the governor before filing a case in the Supreme Court and apprising the governor is just a matter of courtesy,” he said. Balan said that even if rules of business have some provisions, the parent act, the Constitution, is above that. “The act of the government to challenge CAA in Supreme Court and the passing of a resolution against the controversial Act do not violate the Constitution, rules of Assembly or the rules of business. Also, we did not mean to insult the governor. The issue of invoking Article 131 is now before the apex court. If the Supreme Court says that what the governor said is correct, we will accept it,” Balan said, adding that the government does not have an issue with Arif Mohammad Khan.

Not many Gorkhas have this. This will only create panic in the community,” Chhetri said. Chhetri then rekindled the issue of putting Darjeeling under the Sixth Schedule, which he says is the only way to counter NRC and CAA. “When CAA was passed, the Union home minister had said nothing in this section shall apply to the tribal areas of Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Mizoram, which are under the Sixth Schedule and covered under the Inner Line Permit. So, our party demands inclusion of Hills in the Sixth Schedule,” Chhetri said. Keshav Raj Pokhrel, general secretary of the central committee of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Binoy Tamang faction), however, said covering areas under the Sixth Schedule would not stop NRC from being implemented.

Nine-year-old invokes Krishna at Eidgah ground anti-CAA protest | Nagpur News - Times of India,"Nagpur: After heavy Sangh Parivar bashing during earlier rallies against NRC-CAA, nine-year-old Binish Shaikh was seen reciting lines “Krishna Tumhe Aana Hee Hoga” at the ongoing Eidgah grounds women protest in Jaffar Nagar on Tuesday. The hymn is an SOS to Lord Krishna seeking his help in the struggle that has seen mostly Muslim participation till now. Binish was among the children who addressed the over 400 protesters gathered at the ground on the third day of the agitation held by Nagpur Peace Organisation. It will go on till January 29 in support of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh women protesters. Wearing a traditional scarf around her head, Binish read out from a note “Bharat Ke is Mahabharat main Krishna Tumhe Aana Hee Hoga, Sudarshan Chakra Haath main Leke Bhrasht Netaon Ko Narka Tak Pahuchana Hee Hoga”. Lately, there have been efforts to include organizations’ of other communities like Marathas, OBCs, Dalits, tribals along with Sikhs and Christians in the protests. The leaders have been stressing that the law will not only affect Muslims but also others, especially the marginalized classes. Sessions sensitizing leaders of non-Muslim sects are also being held these days. “There is indeed a need for Krishna to come down in the current circumstances of the country. When we were preparing for her speech we found this poem on the Internet,” said Binish’s mother Mehvash Shaikh. She said people were indeed relating the current crisis with the situation depicted in the poetry. “The school in which my kids study has students from other faiths too. We believe in religious tolerance and respect towards other faiths. In fact, the lines were appreciated by others in the community too. We are all Indians irrespective of different faiths,” she said. Amid the protests, lecture on the issue by former UGC chairman Sukhadeo Thorat and journalist-turned-politician Kumar Ketkar were held at Vasantrao Deshpande Hall. “The provisions of the CAA will invite blatant discrimination between various religions. It is unconstitutional and immoral,” said Thorat. The talk ‘Truth behind the unconstitutional CAA, NRC and NPR’ was organized by the Federation of Organisation for Social Justice, Secularism and Democracy on Tuesday evening. Thorat said, “CAA aims to provide a healing touch to the persecuted communities except the Muslims in three Islamic countries. That kind of legislation is discriminatory in nature. The original 1955 Act is based on secular principles.” Ketkar, who was the chief guest, said, “Because of CAA, tribal communities will be unfairly affected. These people live in forests where there are no municipalities or Zilla Parishads. They sometimes don’t have religions and sometimes are not even aware of it. How will government implement NRC? We already have Aadhaar cards. Why is there a need for NPR?” He said that the main object of CAA, NRC and NPR was to divide religions.

The 24x7 protest by men, women and children entered the 24th day on Tuesday. Non-cooperation was a valid democratic tool and it has to be exercised during the enumeration for NPR. NPR was just a ploy as once the NPR was finalised, NRC can be prepared just by clicking the mouse. He also urged the protesters to remain non-violent despite provocations. Earlier in the day, Kanhaiya virtually delivered an ultimatum to CM Nitish Kumar, asking him either to follow the Kerala model on CAA or be ready to face public ire. Call a special meet of the assembly and denounce CAA, said Kanhaiyya. No fury was greater than public fury, warned Kumar. Kanhaiyya also addressed a public meeting at Gaya's Gandhi Maidan, the same, venue where a week ago, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, made a public outreach on the controversial CAA. The former student leader was in Gaya on the third and last day of the three-day organisational meet of the state unit of the CPI, the party to which, Kanhaiyya belongs.

" Muslims organize huge protests across India, challenging Modi | India News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: At least 100,000 people gathered Saturday in Hyderabad, India’s technology hub, to protest Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a new law they say will strip the country of its secular foundations, maintaining steady pressure on the government as demonstrations entered their fourth week. The protests have drawn massive crowds across India, with more than 200,000 people gathering in Kochi city, in the southern state of Kerala, on New Year’s Day. And in Delhi, hundreds continued to camp out on a vital stretch of highway that links the capital to its suburbs, bristling against one of the city’s coldest winters in decades. While the protests are the biggest threat yet to Modi’s tenure in office, they may also be the beginning of a deeper political and social shift in India. From the start the protests have attracted Indians across political stripes and creeds. But with India’s Muslims spearheading the demonstrations this past week, the 200-million strong minority showed it can organize as a formidable force to check Modi’s Hindu nationalist government. The protests began in December when the government passed a law that uses religion as a criterion for determining whether unauthorized migrants in India can be fast-tracked for citizenship. The measure favors members of all South Asia’s major religions except Islam, India’s second largest faith. Muslims worry that the law will be coupled with a citizenship test and used to strip them of their Indian nationality. Modi’s government has said that the measure is misunderstood and aims only to help religious minorities that are persecuted in Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In Hyderabad on Saturday, protesters came out in large numbers despite police restrictions capping the gatherings at 1,000 participants. Organizers said the demonstrations drew 200,000 people, while the local authorities pegged the number at 100,000. The city’s Muslim community organized the protests, and volunteers handed out water and Indian flags. That Muslims continue to organize protests that turn out such large numbers nearly a month after demonstrations first began is remarkable, considering the fragmented nature of the community, among the nation’s poorest and most illiterate, and its limited political power. Indian Muslims hold slightly less than 5% of parliamentary seats, despite making up 14% of the population. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

A government resolution issued on Tuesday said the objective is to instil values such as justice, freedom and equality enshrined in the Constitution.

As per the GR issued, they have directed the schools to put up a plaque or board with the Preamble and asked schools to hold quizzes, essay, drawing, slogan, poster competitions based on the Constitution. In 2016, the directorate of secondary education had also issued the same directive, asking all schools to recite the Constitution. According to the resolution issued, the basic objective was to understand the scope of constitutional values and their all-inclusiveness and instil values such as justice, freedom, equality and fraternity on the society, it is important that students have a comprehensive introduction to the Constitution. The young minds of this age will thus become responsible, cultured citizens. It is expected that this starts during school-going age and that is why every day, during the morning routine, there should be collective reading of the Preamble and a government resolution is already in place for it from 2013. It has now been noticed that the decision is not being implemented. Therefore, under an initiative titled “Sarvabhaumatva Samvidhanache, Janhit Sarvanche” (Sovereignty of the Constitution, Welfare of All), all primary and secondary schools must undertake collective reciting of the preamble every day.

CAA:   Supreme Court to hear pleas challenging CAA on Wednesday | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Wednesday a batch of pleas seeking to examine the constitutional validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). A bench, headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, which had issued notice to the Centre on December 18 on various pleas is likely to hear a batch of 143 petitions, including those filed by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh. CAA seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014. Some of the petitions filed later have also sought a stay on the operation of the legislation which came into force on January 10. The apex court had on January 9 refused to entertain a plea seeking that the CAA be declared constitutional, saying the country is going through difficult times and there is so much violence that endeavour should be for peace. IUML said in its plea that CAA violates the fundamental Right to Equality and intends to grant citizenship to a section of illegal immigrants by making an exclusion on the basis of religion. President Ram Nath Kovind gave assent to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 on December 12, turning it into an Act. IUML seeks an interim stay on the operation of CAA and the Foreigner Amendment (Order), 2015 and Passport (Entry Into Rules), Amendment Rules, 2015. The petition had alleged that the government's CAA was against the basic structure of the Constitution and intended to explicitly discriminate against Muslims as the Act extended benefits only to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians. The plea filed by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, said the Act is a ""brazen attack"" on core fundamental rights envisaged under the Constitution and treats ""equals as unequal"". Ramesh said the substantial questions of law, including whether religion can be a factor to either acquire or deny citizenship in India, arises for consideration of the court as it is a ""patently unconstitutional"" amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955. ""The impugned Act creates two classifications, viz, classification on basis of religion and the classification on the basis of geography and both the classifications are completely unreasonable and share no rational nexus to the object of the impugned Act i.e., to provide shelter, safety and citizenship to communities who in their native country are facing persecution on grounds of religion,"" the plea has said. Several petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the CAA, including by RJD leader Manoj Jha, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi. Several other petitioners include Muslim body Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, All Assam Students Union (AASU), Peace Party, CPI, NGOs 'Rihai Manch' and Citizens Against Hate, advocate M L Sharma, and law students have also approached the apex court challenging the Act.

Magsaysay winner booked by Aligarh police for ‘objectionable remark’ against Savarkar | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: A day after social activist and Magsaysay winner Sandeep Pandey delivered his speech on the AMU campus, Aligarh police booked him on Monday for allegedly using inappropriate language against Hindutva ideologue Veer Savarkar while he was addressing CAA protesters on Sunday. “Pandey was booked under sections 153 (provocation with intent to cause riots) and 505 (1) (b) (inciting public or community to commit an offence) of IPC at Civil Lines police station on a complaint filed by Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) national vice-president Rajeev Kumar Ashish,” said Civil Lines circle officer Anil Samaniya. The investigation is on, he added. In his speech on Sunday, Pandey likened BJP to the British, “as both believed in dividing the people and suppressing dissent”. According to the complainant, he used objectionable language against Savarkar, who was associated with Hindu Mahasabha. Demanding Pandey’s immediate arrest, Rajeev Kumar Ashish threatened to launch a nationwide protest if police failed to discharge their duty. Addressing students at a protest on AMU campus, Pandey had said that the government is misleading people by blaming students for the violence at Jamia, AMU and JNU whereas as the reality is that ‘masked’ RSS and BJP men are the real culprits behind the clashes. Pandey said, “The students are protesting against the Act in a disciplined manner, both in Jamia and AMU. They can’t be blamed for the violence.” He added that the violence was sparked either by masked men sent by BJP and RSS or occurred as a fallout of the police atrocities. The activist was placed under house arrest multiple times and stopped from taking part in peaceful protests but managed to arrive in AMU to address the students.

"Amit Shah rally violated prohibitory orders, poet Munnawar argues | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Urdu poet Munnawar Rana on Tuesday argued that a rally addressed here by Union Home Minister Amit Shah violated prohibitory orders, just as his daughters are accused of doing. Rana's reasoning comes a day after his daughters Sumaiya and Fauzia were named, along with several others, in FIRs registered after protesters defied prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC to take part in a rally at Lucknow's Clock Tower against the Citizenship Amendment Act. On Tuesday, Shah held a public meeting in another part of the city in support of the CAA. Unlike the anti-CAA rally, the organisers had obtained permission from the local authorities for the rally addressed by Amit Shah. But the poet refused to see the difference. The Uttar Pradesh Congress made the same point against Shah in a press statement. “Why is section 144 not for him?"" state unit chief Ajay Kumar Lallu asked. The Union home minister's rally had all the required permissions,” Lucknow's District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash told PTI when contacted. He listed departments like the municipal corporation, public works department (PWD) and police from which permission was obtained. But Rana called Shah's rally an “open violation” of prohibitory orders. When will a case be registered against Home Minister Amit Shah who violated the same orders?” he said. He claimed the case action against his daughters and others protesting against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was “injustice” if Shah's rally was termed “legal”. This is like putting the children of fakirs -- who live on alms -- behind bars when a ‘shah' (king) comes to the city, he claimed. “I have told my daughters not to get scared by the registration of a case. Maximum, it will be a jail term or death,” Rana told PTI. The poet's daughters were among the 160 women booked by police on Monday night for allegedly defying prohibitory orders. The protests at the historical Clock Tower in old Lucknow began on Friday and have continued with hundreds of women braving the cold since then. Prohibitory orders are in force. Yet the women have been staging protests. This amounts to defying the orders and three cases have been lodged at the Thakurganj police station in this connection, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (West Zone) Vikas Chand Tripathi said.

Anti-CAA resolution: HC stays panchayat's move | Kochi News - Times of India,"KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Tuesday issued a stay on Kasaragod district panchayat’s move to pass a resolution against Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA. Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan V issued an interim order granting a stay for three weeks after considering during admission hearing a petition (WP-C No. 1607/2020) filed by K Shreekanth, ward member of Edaneer and BJP Kasaragod district president, through advocate V Sajith Kumar. It was contended by the petitioner that the resolution proposed for the meeting to be held on January 23rd is clearly violative of Kerala Panchayat Raj (Procedure for Panchayat Meeting) Rules, 1995. The proposed resolution relates to a matter under adjudication before the Supreme Court and is therefore against Rule 13(4), the petitioner had argued. In the order, the high court said, “Having considered the admissions advanced, I am of the view that the petitioner has made out a case for issuance of an interim order. There will be an interim order as prayed for, for a period of three weeks.” Scheduling a hearing after three weeks, the court has sought the views of the state government, Kasaragod district panchayath and its president, and Fareeda Sakir Ahamed, chairperson of the standing committee for public works of the district panchayath. The resolution, proposed by Fareeda, was to demand that the central government should repeal CAA and desist from implementing NRC or NPR. The petition filed at the high court said constitutional provisions do not permit a panchayat to pass a resolution against the law made by the Parliament. Allowing local bodies to pass resolutions against a law made by the Parliament will amount to breakdown of constitutional machinery of the state, the plea said. As per rules, a resolution admissible in a panchayat should relate to something within the administrative power of the panchayat and should not be a matter under adjudication by a court of law, the petitioner has contended. The petitioner is seeking a court declaration that the district panchayat’s notice permitting resolution against CAA is illegal and against the Constitution.

""The Opposition is giving money for arson and sponsoring sit-ins and agitations against the CAA to mislead people. But the people have stood behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji and against those who speak the language of our enemies,"" Adityanath said at a rally here in support of the CAA, which was also addressed by Union home minister Amit Shah.

He also lauded the Modi government for enacting the CAA. ""I appreciate the Centre for this move. The previous governments did not have courage to take it up. Now Congress, BSP and SP are creating confusion among the people on the CAA and it's our responsibility to reach out to the people with correct information,"" he added. Issues on which work should have been started after 1947 were taken up by the BJP after it got an absolute majority, Adityanath said. ""In the past six months, you (people) may have witnessed many changes. People in the country were disheartened and demoralised that these issues (CAA, Article 370, etc) might not be resolved. But as our election slogan says, 'Modi hai to mumkin hai' (It is possible if Modi is there), all the issues were resolved,"" he said. After Independence, Congress governments had a chance to work on issues of terrorism, separatism and discrimination but they didn't, the chief minister said, adding that the BJP is dealing with them strictly. ""The Congress did not do anything while other opposition parties, whenever they got a chance, only played politics on crucial issues,"" he said.

They also allege that the CAA along with the National Register of Citizens is intended to target the Muslim community in India.

Addressing a rally here in support of the CAA, Shah also declared that   construction of a Ram temple   ""touching the skies"" in Ayodhya will begin within three months. The minister accused the Congress of not implanting the suggestions that came from its own leaders in the past on granting citizenship to minority Hindus in Pakistan, Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) and Afghanistan after Partition. He also targeted West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, saying she is now opposing Indian citizenship for Dalit Bengalis. At the same meeting, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath alleged that the Congress is shelling out money for “arson” and protests over the CAA.

Because of the sins of your party in 1947, the country's partition on religious basis was accepted.” Mentioning figures, he said the proportion of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains in Pakistan and Bangladesh dropped drastically after Partition. ""Where have they gone? They were either killed, converted or came to India as refugees. These blind people cannot see that atrocities were committed on crores of people,"" he said. Shah asked opposition parties where they were when “crores of people were killed” in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh on the basis of religion. He said five lakh Pandits were displaced from Kashmir, “but these parties did not utter a word”. “Now, because of PM Modi, a new chapter has begun in the lives of these people,"" he said. Shah referred to the recent Supreme Court verdict that allows the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed Ayodhya site. The crowd cheered when he said the construction will begin in three months. Accusing the opposition of speaking the language of Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan, the BJP leader said, ""I don't know what relation they have with Khan."" Shah claimed that Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Indira Gandhi advocated citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan but their Congress party never implemented the suggestion. On Mamata Banerjee, he charged, ""She was demanding citizenship for Dalit Bengalis. Now when the citizenship is being given to them, she has problems."" Shah claimed that during the Rajasthan assembly elections, the Congress had advocated citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan. The CAA allows easier citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who entered India from three neighbouring countries before 2015 after facing religious persecution.

" JD(U)'s Pawan Varma speaks of Nitish's 'private apprehensions' about BJP, questions Delhi alliance | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: JD(U) leader Pavan Varma on Tuesday sought ideological clarity from party president Nitish Kumar over aligning with the BJP in the Delhi elections, referring to the Bihar chief minister's ""private apprehensions"" on how the saffron party is leading the country. In remarks that may embarrass Kumar, Varma claimed in a letter to him that despite his alliance with the BJP in 2017, his ""private apprehensions"" regarding the party and how it was leading India into a ""dangerous space"" did not change. ""I remember your confessing to me in private how the current leadership in the BJP party has humiliated you. You maintained, on more than one occasion, that the BJP is leading India into a 'dangerous space,"" the former Rajya Sabha member and JD(U) general secretary wrote. In the letter, which he shared on social media, Varma said, ""It was your personal view, as conveyed to me, that the BJP is destroying institutions, and that there is a need for democratic and socialist forces within the country to regroup, a task for which you actually assigned a senior party official."" The JD(U) or its president have not reacted to Varma's claims and swipe at Kumar, who has been a frequent critic of the Modi government's policies and had asked his party to stand against its citizenship measures. The JD(U)'s decision to broaden its alliance outside and join hands with the BJP for the Delhi polls has left him ""deeply perplexed"", Varma said, adding that he looked to Kumar for ideological clarity. ""On more than one occasion, you have expressed your grave apprehensions about the BJP-RSS combine, he said in his letter to the Bihar chief minister. ""If these are your real views, I fail to understand how the JD(U) is now extending its alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar, when even long standing allies of the BJP, like the Akali Dal, have refused to do so. This is especially so at a time when the BJP, through the CAA-NPR-NRC combine, has embarked on a massive socially divisive agenda..."" he said. Varma said there is an urgent need for the JD(U) to harmonise what the party's constitution says, what the leader of the party feels in private, and what actions the party takes in public. ""Politics, as you have emphasised to us, must be about principle and the courage of conviction,"" he said in the letter. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

"CAA should be revoked, it’s anti-constitutional: MGS Narayanan | Kochi News - Times of India","KOZHIKODE: Noted historian MGS Narayanan has asked the Centre to revoke the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), terming the controversial law as anti-constitutional and anti- national. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Narayanan said the country was facing an undeclared Emergency-like situation. He exhorted the people to join hands and hold agitations irrespective of political differences. “We cannot accept the move of determining citizenship based on religion.

"Kerala: Governor unrelenting, demands government to withdraw suit | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even after chief secretary Tom Jose met him at Raj Bhavan and gave an explanation on behalf of the state government, governor Arif Mohammad Khan made it clear that he will not let state’s act of filing a suit before the Supreme Court against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) without intimating the same to him to be closed unless the suit is withdrawn. The governor told reporters on Monday that the explanation from the government won’t be suffice and the case will be closed only if the unlawful action is withdrawn. “The approval of governor is needed and they have gone to the Supreme Court without informing me. That is an illegal act and no explanation can satisfy me,” Khan said. However, the governor refused to divulge what transpired between him and the chief secretary in the closed-door discussion on Monday morning and also about his future course of action on the matter. He said that the rules for the transaction of business are framed by the cabinet and the governor only approves it and the government should go by the rules. He said that it is neither clash of ego, nor any personal differences with the government and authority does not give licence to anybody to violate the law or the rule. “You are violating the rules and laws that you yourself have framed,” he said. He added that as the constitutional head of the state, he shall be very careful and would try his best to ensure that the business of the government is transacted strictly in accordance with the rules and the Constitution. “I will not allow constitutional machinery to collapse in the state,” he said. The state had approached the Supreme Court against the CAA, and as per the rules of business, all such matters that affect the relations between the state government and the Centre should be conveyed to the governor before taking it to the apex court. After the governor took serious exception to the state’s action and sought an explanation from the state government, chief secretary Tom Jose had met the governor with an explanation. It is learned that the chief secretary said that there was no intention to bypass the governor and the government approached the court to allay the concerns of the people. The CS hasn’t submitted a written explanation to the governor, rather tried to make it an informal affair by narrating the sequence of events, said sources. Meanwhile, responding to CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s comments that the post of governor itself is unnecessary and should be abolished, he said, “Yechury has not been able to find any fault with what I have done, which is the reason why he is making such comments”. “That’s for the people to decide and they (CPM) should try for that. They are entitled to their view, but this is not the forum,” added Khan. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Nagpur: After CAA, immigrants have no clue how to apply | Nagpur News - Times of India","NAGPUR: Even as protests continue against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), immigrants from Pakistan in the city are waiting for the process to acquire citizenship under the amended law to begin. Nagpur is estimated to have 3,500 Hindu immigrants, mainly from the Sindh province of Pakistan, in addition to a few from Balochistan. They were hoping to get Indian citizenship on a fast track basis, after CAA was put in place. “The delay has left the community anxious, especially in the wake of massive protests against CAA. Many of us are ready with our documents but have no clue where to submit them,” said one of the immigrants, requesting anonymity. “It has been a month since the gazette was published, but no format for applying under the amended law has been put out,” said leaders of migrant communities from Pakistan. The unabating protests have heightened their worry and many have been calling up the ministry of home affairs (MHA), where officials have said it may take at least 2-3 months for the process to begin, as it was “still being worked out”. When asked if the applications could be filed under the existing online format, the answer was that there were chances that an option for CAA may be included in the form, or a separate form may be issued. At present, citizenship applications are routed through the collector’s office in designated districts like Nagpur. With no change intimated, the old process continues. The matter is handled by the resident deputy collector Rajendra Khajanji here. The officer told TOI that he had not received any instructions about granting citizenship via the CAA route, and the applications were still being processed through the earlier procedure. Under this process, the collectorate forwards the applications to the IB for clearance, on the basis of which Indian citizenship is granted, Khajanji said. “From 2017 to 2018, 137 persons were granted Indian citizenship. Nearly 50 more cases have since been sent to to the intelligence bureau (IB) for clearance. No case was cleared during 2019,” the officer added. BC Joshi, the director (citizenship) in the MHA told TOI that “work on the format was under way”, which would be uploaded on the website once it is ready. The officer did not give any further details. Prior to the amendment, applications for citizenship could be filed after living in India for at least 11 years. The minimum requirement has been changed to six years under CAA. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Govt-aided school in UP suspends teacher for being part of ‘violent protest’ during anti-CAA stir | Meerut News - Times of India,"BIJNOR: A government-aided school in UP’s Bijnor district has suspended a social science teacher after his name cropped up in an FIR filed by local police against those who indulged in arson and rioting during anti-CAA protest on December 20. Afzal Qureshi was booked in Bijnor’s Nahtaur town for taking part in the “violent protest”. The protesters turned violent in eight cities of Bijnor. The worst-affected was Nahtaur where two persons-- Suleman and Anas-- were shot dead. Soon after the violence, police filed 34 cases against 3,900 protesters in the entire district and arrested 149 of them. In Nahtaur alone, 39 people were named while 2,200 unnamed were booked for the arson. Qureshi was among those named in the FIR and was missing since then, police said. When contacted, Nahtaur station house officer (SHO) Satya Prakash claimed, “Afzal Qureshi, a teacher in HMI College Nahtaur, was one of the masterminds of the protest. Police had registered a case against him soon after the violence. Since then, he is on the run.” The protesters have been booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC), including sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 (mischief causing damage), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy). Some of them, who were seen indulging in violence, were also slapped with section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC. The decision to suspend Qureshi was taken by the school management. Talking to TOI, principal of the college, Sayyad Bilal Zaidi, confirmed the suspension. He said, “There was winter vacation on December 20, the day violence erupted here. Later, we were told by police that Qureshi was named in an FIR in connection with the violence. Since then, he was continuously absent. We have suspended him.” When contacted, district inspector of school Rajesh Kumar said the school management has informed him about the suspension.

Ranchi: Shaheen Bagh-like protest near Haj House | Ranchi News - Times of India,"RANCHI: Encouraged by the ongoing all-women protest at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi since December 15, women in Ranchi, mostly Muslim and clad in burqa and dupatta, began their indefinite dharna against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) near the Haj House here on Monday. The protesters under the banner of ‘We the people of India’ started their sit-in around 2pm. Zennat, one of protesters coming from Kadru region, said, “We know it is going to be a long dharna because the government has not even found it important to get in touch with hundreds of women sitting at Shaheen Bagh for more than a month, but that is not going to weaken our resolve.” She added that she has brought warm clothes to the venue. Arrangements for tents, blankets and mattresses have been made by the locals. Sagufta Parveen, a teacher, welcome the gathering and expressed gratitude to people across communities coming there to sit for the dharna amid wintry nights. She said, “Those who wanted to go to Pakistan and Bangladesh have already gone. We chose India as our country and we all are Hindustanis. It is our birthright to stay in this nation without any discrimination, but our mother and sisters have been forced to come to the streets to demand our legitimate rights.” One of the facilitators for the sit-in, Tanveer Ahmed, said CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens are against the very basic concept of the Constitution — secularism. He said, “It is not a fight by any particular community, but the Act helped us realise the closeness among different communities that exist in the country.” He further said the local youth are now preparing to make extra arrangements for the agitators at the nearby Idgaah maidan as protesters are poouing in. “We are getting calls supporting our demonstration from different districts and several women are ready to come and join the sit-in. Hence, we have to make additional arrangements,” Ahmed said, adding that expenses made for the event are contributed voluntarily. Stating that they are not accepting financial help as of now, Ahmed said, “Those engaged in food business are providing us with meals, while some others are providing tea. We don’t need cash to carry on the show because its a people’s movement.” Students from JNU and Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi who came back home due to the unrest on their campuses have also joined the chorus. “We are taught about the preamble of the Constitution from school and today, if we find that an elected government is tampering with it, we cannot sit idle,” said Imran, one of the students who turned up to help the protesters. Meanwhile, several activists raised the pitch of protest against CAA, NRC and NPR said they will reject any move for NPR in the state. Addressing a seminar in this regard, Jean Drèze, Shashikant Senthil and Teesta Setalvad among others said these exercises are like an exam for citizenship. Drèze, a visiting professor at Ranchi University, said, “The first step in the exam is the NPR exercise, which is very different from an ordinary population census. The main purpose of the decadal census is to collect data for statistical purpose and not for identifying individuals. But for NPR, people will have to also give details such as their Aadhaar number, which would strengthen the state’s capabilities of surveillance. NRC is like a pellet gun which is mercilessly used by security forces in Kashmir. It is directed at a specific target (community) but will affect others,too.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Assam villagers donate paddy to fund legal fight against CAA | Guwahati News - Times of India,"GUWAHATI: Residents of about 75 villages in Dibrugarh district have donated 45,000kg of paddy to the All Assam Students Union (Aasu) to help fund its legal battle against the new citizenship law. The donation drive at Sasoni mouza in oil-rich Naharkatia had started over two weeks ago, with each household contributing at least 4kg of paddy. Those who didn't have paddy to spare gave the cash equivalent of the quantity they wanted to contribute. At a rally there on Saturday, representatives of the villagers handed over the paddy and around Rs 80,000 in cash to Aasu general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi. The show of solidarity left Gogoi, who has been touring the state almost non-stop since mid-December, overwhelmed. ""These villagers want to protect the identity and future of the Assamese. I am touched by their support to the anti-CAA movement,"" he said. According to Gogoi, the paddy would be ""auctioned"" to raise money. ""I am told more people have expressed their wish to donate paddy. The auction will take place soon,"" he said. Around 40 years ago, four young men from the area - Kumud Gogoi, Ajit Neog, Nripen Borah and Nagen Deka - had been killed while enforcing an oil blockade at the Oil India Ltd headquarters in Duliajan as part of the anti-foreigner agitation. One of the villagers, Dina Borah, said the petition filed by Aasu in the Supreme Court was as crucial to the anti-CAA agitation as the protests on the streets. ""We have collected 450 quintals of paddy till now. We hope to collect 150 quintals more."" The apex court is likely to take up the petition filed by Aasu on Wednesday, sources said. Aasu's contention is that CAA violates the Assam Accord of 1985 and should be scrapped. Read this story in BengaliDownload The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

The CM will be accompanied by state minister Narendra Singh. BJP’s regional president Manvendra Singh said, “The CM is likely to address a gathering at Commercial park in Kidwainagar on January 22 and preparations are underway for the programme.” Singh said the CM will tell the people that “CAA is to give citizenship to the persecuted minorities of the neighbouring countries Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan and not to take away anyone’s citizenship, as the opposition is making out.” He added, “The Act is not against any Indian citizen, but is against those who entered the Indian territory illegally and are involved in anti-social and anti-national activities.” As per instructions, BJP workers are going for a door-to-door campaign and informing the citizens about the facts regarding the amended Act. Police and administrative officials had on Sunday inspected the Commercial park.

"Delhi assembly polls: Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP talks collapse over symbol, CAA | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI/PATIALA: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will not contest the Delhi assembly polls this time after its seat-sharing negotiations with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed on Monday. The seat-sharing talks between SAD and BJP started showing signs of collapsing on Monday evening, according to sources, after BJP insisted on Akali candidates contesting the poll on the ‘lotus’ symbol. It also wanted SAD to accommodate an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) turncoat on one of the four seats that it wanted to contest. Complete Coverage on Delhi ElectionsAkali leaders Balwant Singh Bhunder (Rajya Sabha member) and Prem Singh Chandumajra (former MP) were negotiating with BJP’s Prakash Javadekar, Shyam Jaju and Tarun Chugh on seat-sharing for the past three days. SAD leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, claimed at a press conference that his party had decided not to contest the Delhi assembly polls on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). “SAD is of the firm stand that Muslims cannot be left out of CAA. We are also strongly against National Register of Citizens (NRC). SAD opposes NRC. We cannot accept that Indians will have to stand in queues to prove their identity. This country is for everyone,” said Sirsa. Sources in BJP also said differences with Akalis over CAA have been a sore point. Akalis supported CAA in Parliament and have justified its need, but want Muslims to be brought under its purview. BJP, however, has rejected the demand saying the bill was specifically aimed at fast-tracking citizenship for members of religious minorities from neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, who fled to India before 2014 due to religious persecution. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said every party has its own point of view and he respects the stand taken by the Sikh party. “But our alliance with SAD is still on. It has always supported us in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and they also have a minister in the Union cabinet,” Tiwari said. Initially, there were strong indications that SAD would contest the Delhi assembly polls on its own. After it became clear that talks were not moving forward, Bhunder said BJP wanted SAD leaders to contest the election on BJP symbol and the idea did not go down well with the party leadership. He said the party had asked its candidates to file their papers and would contest polls on its own. However, after BJP announced its alliance with JD-U (three seats) and LJP (one seat) while skipping SAD, Sirsa convened a press conference and announced that the party had decided not to contest at all. The SAD election committee, comprising Rajya Sabha MPs Naresh Gujral and Bhunder along with Chandumajra had finalised names of four Akali candidates for Rajouri Garden, Hari Nagar, Shahdara and Kalkaji seats — the same seats that Akalis had contested in the 2015 Delhi assembly elections. Other seats in Delhi that have a sizeable Sikh population are Tilak Nagar, Janakpuri, Adarsh Nagar, Krishna Nagar, Vishwas Nagar, Timarpur and Jangpura. BJP sources, however, said SAD’s decision to not contest the election at all would not augur well for the saffron party. “The Sikhs in Delhi have always been pro-establishment. The presence of SAD used to divide their votes in other constituencies which have Sikh votes. We saw the Sikhs gravitating towards AAP in the last two elections. With SAD not in the contest now, the Sikh vote may totally go in AAP’s favour,” said a senior BJP leader. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Addressing the participants, activist Harsh Mander said that it was exactly 73 years ago on January 18, 1948, that on the call of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs had come out on the streets to show their support for Muslims in the country. A similar development is taking place again to ensure that nobody faces discrimination, he added. “Love is the soul of the Constitution. Protesters are soldiers of love and Constitution and they have succeeded in stopping those whose attempt was to divide the nation,” he added. “Students’ groups and unions associated with us have already held protests against CAA and NRC at Mallapuram, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Pune, Ahmedabad and other places. We have also conducted Preamble reading sessions in several colleges,” the Young India collective stated. “Young India campaign unites the students and is aimed at protecting the Constitution,” said N Sai Balaji, AISA national president. Members of Jamia Coordination Committee, ANHAD, JNU Students’ Union, Shaheen Bagh Protest Committee (United Youth Brigade) and others also joined the forum in its appeal to the Supreme Court of India to strike down the CAA when it comes for hearing on January 22. Dipankar Bhattacharya of CPIML said: “No one has a problem in giving citizenship to refugees. But today they are dividing on the basis of religion, and tomorrow they’ll do it on the basis of caste and gender.” Former JNU student and activist Umar Khalid took a jibe at the government and said that “despite bad economy the factory of lies was doing good in the country.” Stating that protesters “have learnt equality from Ambedkar and harmony from Gandhi,” Khalid asked them to come out on January 30 and form a human chain at Connaught Place to mark the death anniversary of Gandhi.

Presidency University: CAA stir marks 203rd Founders’ Day programme | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Veteran theatre personality Bibhas Chakraborty, who was the chief guest at the Founders’ Day celebrations at Presidency University on Monday, said there should be a “gana vote”, “plebiscite” or “referendum” before a law like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) are implemented. He was speaking on the sidelines of the institution’s 203rd Founders’ Day celebrations on the College Street campus. “Gana vote hok (let there be mass voting on this issue), plebiscite hok, referendum hok. A law like CAA cannot be passed without consulting the citizens. There should have been wider consultations with the people of the country before such a law was even formulated. After all, it impacts all of us,” the former Presidency student said. “We have been protesting from various forums and will continue to do so. They claim that they have won with 38% vote of the people of this country. But, so what? A democracy does not function like this. Somebody getting 38% vote cannot decide the fate of the entire country. It is just like partition, where some people sitting in Delhi decided to divide the country and millions were displaced overnight. What is happening now in India is similar to that. Let there be a referendum,” he said. Chakraborty, along with several other former students, put their names on a board set up by the students to collect signatures against CAA, NRC and NPR. Former home secretary of Bengal Prasad Ranjan Ray said the opposition parties in the country had failed to put up resistance against CAA and NRC. “I don’t comment on political matters, but this issue has forced me to voice my concerns. We don’t know on what trajectory this will take the country. For my generation, it is impossible to provide the sort of legacy documents that are needed.

Manic Monday: Delhi marches to a halt | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The arterial roads in central Delhi were choked on Monday afternoon owing to back-to-back roadshows, rallies and protest marches. While southeast Delhi is already under siege due to the closure of Kalindi Kunj road, traffic being diverted through Noida Link Road and DND Flyway was also stalled during peak hours. The worst impacted was Vikas Marg between 11am and 1pm. The snarls started around 1pm when supporters of Aam Aadmi Party gathered at Mandi House and Connaught Place Outer Circle for a protest march and a roadshow. Police shut one carriageway of Sikandra Road and a portion of Outer Circle from Minto Road for the rallies. As a result, traffic jams started building up on Sikandra Road, DDU Marg and Minto Road. The ripple effect of the jam reached ITO within an hour. Soon, police shut Outer Ring Road and Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg for VIP movement from Talkatora Stadium to the BJP office on DDU Marg. Since ITO crossing had to be closed for 15 minutes for the VIPs to pass, the snarl reached Vikas Marg and Noida Link Road even as police tried to clear the vehicles accumulated on the stretch. “I was stuck on Vikas Marg for nearly 40 minutes around 3pm before I could reach ITO for work,” said Devika Bhalla, a resident of Noida. Commuters tweeted about the snarls tagging the traffic police. Police said they had to control the traffic signals manually. A senior police officer said that the increase in volume of traffic from Noida added to the mess. According to an estimate, there has been a 20% increase in the number of vehicles that earlier used the south Delhi stretches to enter the city from Noida. As a result, nearly 40,000 vehicles are added to the existing volume at ITO, which is the busiest intersection in the city.

"Bhupinder Singh Hooda echoes Kapil Sibal, says state can’t say no to CAA | Chandigarh News - Times of India","CHANDIGARH: After Kapil Sibal, another senior Congress functionary Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said that states should not refuse to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) as the law was passed by the parliament. The leader of opposition in Haryana assembly was responding the queries of mediapersons over the CAA issue. Hooda maintained that since the issues related to CAA were pending with the Supreme Court, there was a scope of legal review. “Once a law or an Act is passed by the parliament, I think that the constitutional view is that, any state cannot and should not say no...but this has to be legally examined,” the former chief minister was quoted as saying by a news agency. Later speaking to TOI, Hooda maintained such laws were subject to legal examination. “If a law is passed in the parliament due to numbers, there is always a scope of legal review. This is what I meant,” he said. Hooda’s statement has come at a time when the Congress government in neighbouring Punjab has passed a resolution against CAA and announced not to implement the law. Other Congress-ruled states are expected to take similar steps, according to news reports. Former Union minister Sibal had stated on Sunday that every state assembly had the constitutional right to pass a resolution and seek the amended Act’s withdrawal, but if the law was declared constitutional by the Supreme Court, then it would be problematic to oppose it.

Back to classroom: Delhi cops counsel rioters on CAA | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Special Investigation Team of Delhi Police has started a counselling programme for the rioters arrested during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. Following a court order, they are being made to attend classes where they are told about the provisions of the new law. On Sunday, the ‘teacher’ also fielded questions from the ‘students’ in a two-hour session. The main query of the 15 bailed men was whether they would be deported if they failed to provide proof of their citizenship. Police sources said the men mostly claimed to be daily wage labourers, here in Delhi to earn a livelihood in the factories in north-east Delhi. According to an officer, one of the men admitted that he had not known about CAA at the time of the violent protests, but had learnt about it from peers after his arrest. Like others, his concern was about being deported or sent to a detention camp. The cops had hired a legal expert to explain the provisions of the Act to the men to clear any misunderstanding they might have. They were also encouraged to bring their family members or anyone else to learn more about what the amendment to the Citizenship Act entailed. An officer said, “We also handed the men copies of the Act so they could read about its provisions themselves. The language was simplified to enable them to understand it.” Some religious leaders were also roped in advise the rioters to avoid violence while protesting. The men who were arrested after the violent demonstrations in Seelampur and Daryaganj in December last year were asked to clear the doubts people known to them might have about the provisions. Delhi Police has arrested 100 people in connection with the violence, and efforts are being made to identify others who had gone on a rampage. Most were nabbed from Seelampur and Jafrabad. Police will conduct counselling sessions for all the others arrested when they are bailed by the courts. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
West Bengal will pass anti-CAA resolution: CM Mamata Banerjee | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA/SILIGURI: Ramping up the rhetoric against the new citizenship law and the BJP government at the Centre, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said in Kolkata on Monday that the state assembly would pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.  She also appealed to all north-eastern and opposition parties to ""study"" the National Population Register (NPR) directives before implementing them; she pointed out some ""contentious columns"" introduced in the NPR form ""to pave the way for a countrywide National Register of Citizens (NRC)"". ""We will pass a resolution against CAA. There can be an all-opposition party meet in Kolkata. The Centre should remove all clauses in NPR that support NRC,"" Mamata said. ""I appeal to all state governments in the northeast, including Tripura and Assam, to know the law before taking a decision on NPR. It is a dangerous game and totally related to NRC and CAA. Pass a resolution everywhere to withdraw CAA,"" the Bengal CM urged in Kolkata before leaving for Siliguri in north Bengal. The CM iterated her NPR apprehensions during the inauguration of the Uttarbanga Utsav in Siliguri. ""The NPR authorities have introduced a column in the form, where people have to mention parents' dates and places of birth. But where do I get my parents' birth certificates from?"" she asked.  ""The NPR form is just like a mark sheet. One has to fill in each and every column of the form just like one has to pass subjects mentioned in a mark sheet. So, if you leave a column empty in the NPR form, it may be deemed incomplete,"" Banerjee said, explaining her fears. But she also reassured the public: ""Don't worry. We are your watchdog.""

 Assam villagers donate paddy to fund CAA fight | India News - Times of India,"GUWAHATI: Residents of about 75 villages in Dibrugarh district have donated 45,000kg of paddy to the All Assam Students Union (Aasu) to help fund its legal battle against the new citizenship law. The donation drive at Sasoni mouza in oil-rich Naharkatia had started over two weeks ago, with each household contributing at least 4kg of paddy. Those who didn't have paddy to spare gave the cash equivalent of the quantity they wanted to contribute. At a rally there on Saturday, representatives of the villagers handed over the paddy and around Rs 80,000 in cash to Aasu general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi. The show of solidarity left Gogoi, who has been touring the state almost non-stop since mid-December, overwhelmed. ""These villagers want to protect the identity and future of the Assamese. I am touched by their support to the anti-CAA movement,"" he said. According to Gogoi, the paddy would be ""auctioned"" to raise money. ""I am told more people have expressed their wish to donate paddy. The auction will take place soon,” he said. Around 40 years ago, four young men from the area — Kumud Gogoi, Ajit Neog, Nripen Borah and Nagen Deka — had been killed while enforcing an oil blockade at the Oil India Ltd headquarters in Duliajan as part of the anti-foreigner agitation. One of the villagers, Dina Borah, said the petition filed by Aasu in the Supreme Court was as crucial to the anti-CAA agitation as the protests on the streets. “We have collected 450 quintals of paddy till now. We hope to collect 150 quintals more.” The apex court is likely to take up the petition filed by Aasu on Wednesday, sources said. Aasu’s contention is that CAA violates the Assam Accord of 1985 and should be scrapped. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

The protesting women and around 50 men left the venue, though not without some hard negotiations with the police to extend the protest timing.A group of men requested Gangurde to let the women carry on for another two hours, till 8pm.

On Monday, the protesters didn’t use loudspeakers between 11am and 2pm to avoid disturbing the school. Amid talks of the permission getting extended till 8pm or 10pm, more women walked into the venue in the evening, which saw a bigger turnout than the day before.“11am is too early for many women to finish their household tasks.

Muslim MLAs seek resolution against CAA in assembly | Jaipur News - Times of India,"Jaipur: Muslim MLAs have asked CM Ashok Gehlot to bring a resolution against the CAA in the state assembly following pressure from protesters. MLA Shafia Zubair from Ramgarh (Alwar), Wajib Ali from Nagar (Bharatpur), Amin Kagzi from Kishenpole (Jaipur) and Zahida Khan from Kaman (Bharatpur) have urged Gehlot to take a stand similar to Punjab and Kerala governments against the Act. The latest to demand a resolution is Kagzi who shot a letter to Gehlot on Monday demanding a resolution against the CAA during the assembly session starting from January 24. “I have apprised the CM about the sentiments of people from diverse faiths on the nefarious designs of the central government to divide the country. I have urged the CM to take a strong institutional stand against the CAA through the state assembly,” said Kagzi. Kerala and Punjab have already announced to bring a resolution in their respective assemblies. First-time MLA Shafia Zubair feels that Rajasthan, which is on the fore fighting the fascist forces, should have taken the lead against the attack on the Constitution. “Gehlot has been upholding the ethos and values of the Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and BR Ambedkar. Needless to say that CAA, NPR or NRC will ever see the light of the day in Rajasthan,” said Zubair. Ali, a graduate from Australia, was the first to pitch for the resolution in the assembly. A vocal critic of CAA, he has held protests in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago had asked the CM last week to protect the tarnishing of the Constitution by the fascist regime. “I would love to see Rajasthan leading the anti-CAA front,” said Ali, who was elected on a BSP ticket and merged with five other BSP MLAs into the Congress in Septemer 2019. MLA from Kaman (Bharatpur) Zahida Khan went to the extent of writing to Congress acting president Sonia Gandhi to ask all Congress and Congress allied ruled states to have a debate on the CAA and bring a resolution against it. The state has eight Muslim MLAs in the assembly. They are all from the Congress, while the previous BJP regime led by Vasundhara Raje rule (2013-2018) had two Muslim MLAs from the saffron party. Interestingly, Congress MLAs have been toeing the party line on CAA but none other than the Muslim lawmakers of the party has demanded a resolution.

But, before we protest against this unconstitutional Act, it is really important that we abstain from provocative and religious sloganeering. With CAA, they are attacking the secular nature of this country. We must form an alliance which is forged in friendship, we need the support of all the secular forces in our country to resist CAA and the implementation of NRC,” he said while inaugurating the Camaraderie Meet as part of the MahalFest held here on Monday. Justice Pasha strongly condemned the provocative and offensive sloganeering in the protests and cautioned that religious extremists are making use of this opportunity to strengthen their hold. “Many people may not like what I am about to say. But what is the relevance of speaking about the violence occurred in the communal riots in the past at the protest gatherings against CAA? It will only further divide the gap between our communities. The ruling party came unto power using communal polarization and they are very successful at doing so. We should not fall for that again and we must isolate extremists among ourselves. Extremism does not have a religion, be it Hindu or Muslim, extremists are extremists,” he added. Justice Pasha also urged the people to seek the help of judiciary in the fight against CAA and NRC.

Manic Monday: City marches to a halt | Delhi News - Times of India,"New Delhi: The arterial roads in central Delhi were choked on Monday afternoon owing to back-to-back roadshows, rallies and protest marches. While southeast Delhi is already under siege due to the closure of Kalindi Kunj road, traffic being diverted through Noida Link Road and DND Flyway was also stalled during peak hours. The worst impacted was Vikas Marg between 11am and 1pm. The snarls started around 1pm when supporters of Aam Aadmi Party gathered at Mandi House and Connaught Place Outer Circle for a protest march and a roadshow. Police shut one carriageway of Sikandra Road and a portion of Outer Circle from Minto Road for the rallies. As a result, traffic jams started building up on Sikandra Road, DDU Marg and Minto Road. The ripple effect of the jam reached ITO within an hour. Soon, police shut Outer Ring Road and Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg for VIP movement from Talkatora Stadium to the BJP office on DDU Marg. Since ITO crossing had to be closed for 15 minutes for the VIPs to pass, the snarl reached Vikas Marg and Noida Link Road even as police tried to clear the vehicles accumulated on the stretch. “I was stuck on Vikas Marg for nearly 40 minutes around 3pm before I could reach ITO for work,” said Devika Bhalla, a resident of Noida. Commuters tweeted about the snarls tagging the traffic police. Police said they had to control the traffic signals manually. A senior police officer said that the increase in volume of traffic from Noida added to the mess.

" Anti-CAA stir: 1,800 from Kerala get summons from Mangaluru cops | India News - Times of India","KASARGOD: Close to 2,000 people in Kerala’s Kasaragod district have received summons from Mangaluru police asking them to appear before their officials in relation to the probe into the violent anti-CAA protests that rocked the city on December 19 and left two people dead in police firing. A majority of those who received the notices are Muslims, and seem to have been chosen on the basis of their cellphone location on the day of the protests. Kasaragod district panchayat member Ali Harshad Vorkady said as per his estimate, around 1,800 people in Kasaragod district have got notices so far. Vorkady, who has taken up the issue with the authorities here, said: “They are falsely implicating innocent people. Worse, they are insinuating that people from Kerala were behind the riots in Mangaluru. This is dangerous and questions the right of free movement of people even to neighbouring places.” The notices, sent by an assistant commissioner of police of the Mangaluru city crime record bureau, mention the date and time for the appearance and warn that failure to appear would be construed as “evading the investigation” and invite “further legal procedure”. Kasaragod district borders Karnataka and thousands of people, including traders, fisherfolk, students and bank employees, travel to and from Mangaluru. For several small towns on the Kerala side, Manguluru is the biggest city in the vicinity and caters to their medial and commercial needs. Several people contacted by TOI were incredulous at receiving the notices. “I run a crusher unit here and I was in Mangaluru on that day for some lathe work of my machinery. I knew there was some protest going on in the city but I returned to Kasaragod soon after my work got over,” said Chengala resident Ahammed Ashif. He has been asked to appear on January 21. Muhammed Kunhi, a fish trader from Manjeshwar, said many from the fish-selling fraternity have got notices. “We depend on Mangaluru to procure fish and earn our livelihood, but now we are being termed rioters just because we were there in the city that day, that too many hours before the violence broke out,” he said. Rameela Moyyaddi from Manjeshwar got a notice even though she was nowhere near Mangaluru on December 19. Her husband Bawa had gone to procure fish from the city and had taken her cellphone, as he often does. “I was shocked, but later I came to know that many people like me have been served notice even though we did not cross the state border that day,” she said. As reported by TOI in its December 28 edition, a Karnataka government circular issued during the protests asking colleges in Dakshina Kannada district to keep tabs on students from Kerala had kicked up a storm.

Soon after it became clear that talks were not moving forward, SAD senior leader and Rajya Sabha member Balwant Singh Bhunder stated that the BJP wanted SAD leaders to contest the election on BJP symbol and the idea did not go down well with the party leadership. He said the party has asked its candidates to file their paper. However, after the BJP announced its alliance with JD(U) - three seats - and LJP - one seat - while skipping the name of SAD, party leader Majinder Singh Sirsa called a presser where he stated that the party has decided not to contest the elections as it was against non-inclusion of all minorities in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Surprisingly, the seat-sharing talks between SAD-BJP continued to hang in balance till Monday evening and during this, the election committee of the SAD comprising senior party leaders Rajya Sabha MPs Balwant Singh Bhunder and Naresh Gujral along with former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra had finalised the names of four of its candidates to contest from Rajouri Garden, Hari Naar, Shahdara and Kalkaji seats on which Akalis contested the 2015 elections. Soon after it became clear that BJP was unbending over its stance and not letting the SAD to contest on its own party symbol, the SAD leaders in Delhi called a presser late Monday evening and said the decision not to contest the election has been taken as the BJP wanted the SAD to review its stand on CAA.

Better late than never.... Glad that she realized the necessity to pass this resolution. We welcome her decision,"" the Congress leader said. Earlier this month, the TMC had prevented the passage of an anti-CAA resolution in the Assembly, drawing criticism from the Congress and the CPM.

Incidentally, Kerala and Punjab have passed a resolution against the citizenship law. CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty said he would keep his fingers crossed as the CM often went back on her words. ""The CM says one thing in the morning and absolutely the opposite in the evening. So, unless the resolution sees the light of the day, it is difficult to say anything. Last time, we had followed all parliamentary norms to move the resolution against the CAA,"" Chakraborty said.

"Creators contribute posters, paintings to be used at CAA protests | Chennai News - Times of India","CHENNAI: It has been nine years since Anjali Chandrashekar left Chennai to pursue design at Pratt Institute, New York. But no spell of homesickness she experienced over the years quite paralleled the turmoil she underwent in the last month, of “being away from the country that raised you, at a time when it is bravely fighting injustice,” says the 26-year-old. As countrywide demonstrations against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) take over public spaces and campuses, brewing at the heart of all the noise and outrage is a quiet cultural revolution. Courtesy artists, illustrators and photographers from across the world who are contributing works of dissent to be used free of cost at any protest site that needs them. Anjali, for instance, figured that despite the distance, she retained the sole medium that could travel across seas to communicate her resistance. Her painting featuring a sisterhood of different faiths with the ‘Azadi!’ slogan splashed across it, has been used at Valluvar Kottam, Chennai, as well as Shaheen Bagh, New Delhi, and protest sites across Mumbai, Bengaluru, New York and LA. “Art not only has the ability to cut across age, language and literacy, it also provides a powerful platform for dialogue. In order to challenge the status quo, we need to envision a world without those systems. Creatives play a huge role in helping visualise counter-narratives, bridging gaps, and spurring action,” says Anjali. Vikram Savio Moses, a Chennai-based radio presenter and one of the protesters at Valluvar Kottam, says haunting posters on police brutality spoke volumes, more than any slogans could at the protest site. “One of them was a painting of a cop with a raised cane and a young woman huddled before him, reminiscent of the Jamia Millia violence. And holding it up was a young girl of about ten. As much as this scene broke our hearts, it nailed the sentiment at the scene and the hard reality of things.” Among those working tirelessly to connect artists seeking dynamic platforms with protesters looking for ingenious ways to rebel, is Kadak Collective. Against the burgeoning anti-CAA movement, Kadak put out an open call to artists and designers to send in posters, flyers and educational material expounding ideas of unity, respect and civil disobedience. Its Creatives Against CAA bank is now a repository of wit, humour and anger galvanized by sharp captioning and striking visuals. “I noticed that when Jamia Millia was attacked, the fact that it happened not in Kashmir or Assam, but at the capital, suddenly made the country start taking protests seriously. And I decided art should be a big part of it,” says Mira Felicia Malhotra of Kadak. “We wanted to arm protesters with art, while protecting the rights of artists. So, we distributed their works under a Creative Commons license and had people in Iowa, Hague, London and New York City downloading and using them. This way, even those outside of India had an informed understanding of what’s going on.” Among the approximately 120 creators that Kadak has roped in is Sonaksha Iyengar, for who art is the primary voice of activism. Her work has been used to fuel social media campaigns over the last month and Sonaksha believes this is a critical part of the anti-CAA movement. “Many people are unable to get out on the streets and participate in protests because they can’t afford to be detained or have chronic physical illnesses. So, a lot of mobilisation is happening online,” she says. “We cannot underestimate the role of social media at this time, and the heavy trolling and taking down of anti-CAA material from digital platforms is proof of this.” Kadak also provides detailed information on the CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC), their legal ramifications, to counter a propaganda of misinformation, says Mira. “Designers are taking this content, translating it into multiple languages, and typesetting it to different scripts, so you have flyers and brochures created on it. This is one of the ways design can set the record straight.” At Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, where scores — including new mothers with babies — have been sitting in protest around-the-clock for more than a month now, a small section has been earmarked for artists to sit and paint. Afreen Idris, a final year student of history at Jamia Millia Islamia and an artist on the site, says despite the overwhelming sense of restlessness that has engulfed students over December’s violence and loss of semester days, art is a breath of fresh air and a defined voice to their dissent. “So much has been spoken, so many slogans raised. But what we can’t communicate verbally, we express through paintings — precisely and peacefully,” she says. “It’s the kind of human-centered storytelling that in all forms, has the ability to connect with, and unite people,” says Anjali.

" Cut-off year controversy: Himanta Biswa Sarma a 'habitual liar', says Tarun Gogoi | India News - Times of India","GUWAHATI: Calling Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma a ""habitual liar"", Congress leader Tarun Gogoi on Monday alleged that the BJP leader had lied in the assembly about the Assam Accord despite submitting an affidavit in the Supreme Court with 1971 as the cut-off year for detecting and deporting illegal immigrants. The former Assam chief minister accused Sarma, who was his former cabinet colleague, of ""misleading"" people of the state with ""false explanations"". Gogoi's comments on Sarma came a day after the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) had made similar allegations against Sarma, saying he had lied in the assembly by claiming there was no mention of March 24, 1971 cut-off date in the Accord. ""Himanta Biswa Sarma lied in the assembly that the Accord did not say anything about 1971. Lying is his habit. What more can we expect when the Prime Minister Narendra Modi lies on everything,"" Gogoi told reporters here. Sarma is misleading the people of Assam to deviate the movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he said. ""Himanta himself had submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court on July 14, 2015 on fixing 1971 as base year for the NRC update work. It is strange that now he is saying that there is no mention of 1971 in the Accord,"" Gogoi said. He asked how were the Foreigners' Tribunals conducting trials for suspected illegal immigrants coming to Assam after March 24, 1971 if there was no mention of the cut-off date in Assam Accord. On January 13, Sarma had said in the assembly that the amended Citizenship Act does not violate the Assam Accord, but is aimed at addressing the ""unresolved"" issues of the pact. ""The Assam Accord didn't speak about children of those coming before 1971, so it's inconclusive,"" he had said. ""The Assam Accord is not that bad. If we had read it properly, 1966 would have been the cut off year and 1967 voter list would have been the NRC. I regret that,"" he had claimed citing clauses 5.1 to 5.7 of the pact. However, Sarma did not mention Clause 5.8 of the Accord which says, ""Foreigners who came to Assam on or after March 25, 1971 shall continue to be detected, deleted and expelled in accordance with law. Immediate and practical steps shall be taken to expel such foreigners."" AASU chief adviser Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya had on Sunday demanded that Sarma and chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal apologise to the people for providing ""wrong explanation"" about the Accord at the one-day special session of the assembly on January 13. A six-year agitation demanding identification and deportation of illegal immigrants was launched by the AASU in 1979. It had culminated with the signing of the Assam Accord on August 15, 1985, in the presence of the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Assam's prominent personalities write to CJI over CAA stir | India News - Times of India,"GUWAHATI: Ten prominent personalities of Assam, including Sahitya Akademi awardees Hiren Gohain and Homen Borgohain and eminent filmmaker Jahnu Barua, have written to Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde urging him to deliberate on the prevailing ""public outrage and anger in the country"". The letter, made available to the media on Monday, stated that the government has characterised the ongoing protests across in the country as being organised by ""mischievous elements"" whereas the ""reaction of thousands of people has earned the sympathy of all right thinking sections of the society"". ""It is quite possible that there may have been certain excesses, as mentioned in some press reports, and these are to be deplored but the public discontent and unrest can hardly be dismissed as wilful violence, as is being currently done by the government,"" the letter said. Signatories to the letter include Sahitya Akademi awardee Nagen Saikia, scientist Dinesh Chandra Goswami, former Gauhati University vice chancellor Gajendra Nath Talukdar and ex-principals of Cotton College and Gauhati Medical College, Udayaditya Bharali and N N Barman respectively. ""The younger generation as admitted by all impartial observers is particularly aggrieved and agitated by certain issues that have cast a dark shadow on their lives. ""In Assam, the threat of unchecked migration from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh had been compared by the Supreme Court to a silent invasion and the NRC for Assam was expeditiously prepared under the monitoring of the highest court,"" it said. The letter said that at this juncture, granting citizenship to a large number of foreigners will put immense pressure on scant resources of the state and its native population. The gravity of the situation may be gauged from the fact that while the population density of India is 375 per sq km, in Assam it has soared to 400 and given the total land comprising numerous water bodies and hills, the actual density here may even be as much as 1000 per sq km, it pointed out. ""When a democratically elected government in any country arbitrarily and insensitively ignores justified public anxieties and apprehensions and seeks to suppress the reasonable alarm with denial and severe repression, the public reaction to such an attitude tends to be an explosion of frustration and anger,"" the letter said. The signatories hoped that the apex court will pay attention to this issue in the interest of justice and healthy democracy as ""people habitually look up to the Supreme Court to maintain our democracy with alacrity and vigour"".

Anti-CAA protests: Plea in SC over traffic blockade in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the police to ensure smooth traffic flow on Delhi's Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch which is closed for over a month due to anti Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests. The Delhi high court on January 14 did not order forthwith removal of traffic restrictions, the plea said, adding the HC had said that no direction can be issued by it on how to handle an agitation or the place of protest and the traffic as it depended on ground reality and wisdom of police. The high court had asked the police to look into the issue while also keeping in mind that law and order is maintained, it said. Lawyer-activist Amit Sahni has filed a special leave petition in the apex court seeking supervision of the situation in Shaheen Bagh, where several women are sitting on an indefinite protest, by a retired Supreme Court judge or a sitting judge of the Delhi high court in order to circumvent any violence. Sahni in his plea said that protests in Shaheen Bagh has inspired similar demonstrations in other cities and to allow it to continue would set a wrong precedent. ""No one can be permitted to occupy a public road for any reason whatsoever under pretext of peaceful protest and that too for indefinite period to make others suffer for the same. ""The protests at public road cannot be permitted to continue as the same would set a wrong precedent and the same has inspired Shaheen Bagh-style protests in Prayagraj, Gaya, Nagpur, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Lucknow and Kota,"" the plea said. The petitioner also said that businessmen has been suffering huge losses as shops in the vicinity of the protest site are ""bound or compelled"" to remain closed due to the protests. The Kalindi Kunj stretch is quite crucial as it connects Delhi, Faridabad in Haryana and Noida in Uttar Pradesh. Commuters who use these roads are forced to take alternative routes -- Delhi-Noida-Delhi (DND) Expressway and Ashram -- which is causing hours of traffic jams and wastage of time and fuel, the plea stated. ""The protesters have been using loudspeakers, as per reports, thus 'unrestricted holding of public meetings', processions, demonstrations, etc. has caused obstruction to traffic and disturbance of public tranquillity. It is not known that for how long this road would remain closed and no protestors can occupy the road indefinitely. ""The situation is extremely sensitive as there is huge business loss to the businessmen, who are having shops in the vicinity but are bound/compelled to close their shops due to the alarming situation,"" the petition said. The high court, on January 10, had refused to entertain an application, in the form of letter, seeking directions for removal of demonstrators protesting the CAA at Shaheen Bagh here in order to clear road blockages that are causing traffic congestions at the DND route.

"Delhi: Students protest at Mandi House against CAA, NRC | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Hundreds of students marched from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar on Monday to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register for Citizens.

They marched through Lutyens Delhi escorted by police while raising slogans. The students also lauded protesters at Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia Islamia, who have been on a sit-in against the CAA for a month. The march led by the Young India Coordination Committee was joined by several student organisations and coordination committee of Jamia and Shaheen Bagh. Dinesh Kumar, research scholar at Ambedkar University, said, ""The centre is being selective on which minority communities they will be giving citizenship to. Why is there a selective approach? Why is citizenship linked to religion here? What about atheists?"" Citing economic crisis, Anushree Joshi, a student of Lady Shri Ram College, said the Centre does not have resources for their own citizens and with implementation of CAA, how will the government provide resources to them with such economic slowdown? ""Besides, the very basis of allotment of citizenship is religion which goes against the secular fabric of our country,"" she said. Former Jawaharlal Nehru Students' Union president N Sai Balaji led the march along with former JNU student Umar Khalid and student leader Kawalpreet Kaur. ""We urge the Supreme Court to scrap the unconstitutional CAA. We are protesting to save the Constitution,"" Balaji said. Miraj, a member of Shaheen Bagh Coordination Committee, said the women at their protesting site have set an example for the rest of the country by sitting peacefully for the last 35 days to protect the Constitution. ""When Delhi was shivering under extreme cold, the grandmothers at Shaheen Bagh were out on the streets to save the Constitution. The protest that was triggered due to violence at Jamia has now set an example for the entire nation and there is a Shaheen Bagh springing up at every other place,"" he said. Shahdosh Aalam, a member of the Jamia Coordination Committee, said they will not step down unless the Centre rolls back CAA and challenged the Home Minster to visit Shaheen Bagh, speak to students of Jamia and address the protesting students and public. ""I was witness to the police brutality that was unleashed at Jamia Millia Islamia. We were lathicharged and attacked. I challenge the government. They may call the police or use tear gas but none of these can stop our sentiments against CAA. The nationwide protests show that the Centre is wrong and their intensions are wrong,"" he said.

"Shaheen Bagh anti-CAA stir: Protest on their lips, solidarity on their plate | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Every protest has its foods—foods that become symbols, touch emotions and offer solidarity and succour, forging bonds that go beyond all kinds of divisiveness. When Mahatma Gandhi led the march from Sabarmati to Dandi, he was conscious of using salt as a symbol—one that affected the poorest person and binds Hindus, Muslims and all of humanity alike. The salt tax imposed by the British was hardly new—it had, in fact, been enacted in 1882, almost 50 years before the salt march — but the peaceful civil disobedience movement needed a powerful symbol, and salt it was. We have seen similar symbolism come up in protest after protest globally. About a decade ago, Icelanders dumped potatoes outside their Parliament in Reykjavik to protest about the poor economy, meaning to point out to their government that, 'Iceland has become a potato country.' Or, that their leaders were 'stupid as potatoes', as the Smithsonian magazine quoted a protester as saying. A few years down the line, there were reports of Ukranian protesters throwing noodles at the Russian consulate over the Russian media’s controversial reportage of their issues because in Ukraine and Russia 'to hand noodles over someone’s ears' means to pull someone’s leg. The protesters were literally calling the media a joke! We all know about eggs making a splash, and tomatoes used to protest against anything rotten — films, but also rotten council men in Spain, a tradition now commemorated every year as La Tomatina festival. In Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests are raging strong, mooncakes with protest messages and 'teargas' gelatos (made with black pepper) have appeared to protest against a government shooting gas canisters at protesters. In India, the anti-CAA-NRC protests are bringing about new cultural expressions of dissent too such as cheeky posters, graffiti, caricatures etc. But more than anything else, it is the way people have been sharing food and using it as a symbol of bonding and solidarity that is a break from India’s chequered tradition of food dividing people along religious and caste lines. In a society where the photo of a beef dish posted by the official Kerala tourism handle can spark a war of words, where rigid caste hierarchies manifest in who you share your food with, where 'unclean' menstruating women are kept out of kitchens, discrimination is being turned upside down through a new emerging culture of inclusiveness around food at protest venues. The protesting Shaheen Bagh women sharing biryani with all those who come to protest, or Punjab farmers and activists cooking kheer and kada prasad as part of a langar to feed protesters of all religions may be the most eye-grabbing visuals going around, but these are hardly exceptions. ""Everyone who goes to the protests carries some food with them. You feel, khali haath kya jaayen, it is a way to support people in the bitter cold, and to do our little bit,” says Abhilasha Ojha, art curator and writer, who spent New Year’s eve at the Shaheen Bagh protest. She and her husband took makhana, biscuits and Pulse candy to distribute. There are many accounts of young professionals distributing cake and cookies to children, a baker who does brownies for protesters, cab drivers who contribute parantha-subzi or parantha-achar rolls daily to feed the hungry. People sharing food to offer solidarity and support is not confined to one geographical area either. In Mumbai, a restaurant owner who does not wish to be named, attended a protest and found ""people passing around pulao, ice cream and tea… I took a crate of water,” he says, adding, ""there was a genuine feeling of sharing and caring and everything was being distributed to everyone. It is unlike anything that I have ever seen before,” he says. Abstaining from food, or fasting, may have been frequently employed in the past to make a point and protest, but now sharing food —all kinds, veg and non-veg, humble and rich – without any barriers is a new way in which Indians are showing that they care about their deepest values.

He also said the government should issue a written clarification on the issue. ""An atmosphere of fear is being created on the issue of citizenship.

Bose, a grandnephew of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have categorically noted the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is not based on religion. However, statements made by some other leaders are creating confusion. ""In order to deal with this, I think that this clause should be included (in the new law) that the CAA is not based on religion... and Muslims should also be included in it,"" he said. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act aims to provide Indian citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis who entered India on or before December 31, 2014 from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, having fled religious persecution in their countries. ""Now what will happen to the Muslims who had come to this country before that date? There is a confusion. The Centre must take steps to remove that confusion,"" Bose said. A few state BJP leaders PTI approached declined to comment on Bose's statements. Bose had pitched for the inclusion of Muslims in the CAA earlier also.

Police took proactive measures by barricading sensitive spots to prevent protesters from outside the district from entering the city. The curbs were in place on Saturday itself, with police checking vehicles at sensitive spots. Hotel owners were asked to provide information about “suspicious” guests on their premises.

They only paid lip service to those who died while our party is assisting the grieving families and providing monetary support to the victims,” he said. Notably, protests against CAA turned violent in eight towns of Bijnor. Bijnor and Nahtaur were most affected. In Nahtaur, two persons were killed in firing. Cops later admitted that Suleiman was killed in police firing in self-defence during the protests while Anas was killed by stray bullet. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
NRC-CAA is black law for the country: Bhim Army chief Chandrasehekhar Azad | Meerut News - Times of India,"MEERUT: “It is clear that the intention of the government - in the backdrop of the deaths that occurred in the violence of December 20 in the entire country - was wrong. The National Register for Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) are black law of the country. This law will hamper the unity and secularism of the country. The government should immediately withdraw the law,” said Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad. Azad was in Meerut to meet the families of the deceased in the December 20 violence in the district. Please refused him to meet the families of the deceased and there and hence we had to meet them at another place in the district. He met the family at city is Hira Garden her. “What happened in Meerut on December 20 was extremely horrific. According to what the families have told me here, it is clear that Hitler rule is on in the district. Most of those killed in the December 20 violence had got police gunshots. We have approach the high court in the matter for relief and the case will be heard on December 23. An investigation should be set up against the accused police personnel,” said Azad. Azad further said that we live in a democracy and in a democracy everybody has a right to say what they believe in. “Nobody can be shot in the head in the name of democracy. The situation of UP was not such even at the time of Babri demolition and at the time when section 370 was scrapped,” said Azad. Azad further tweeted from his account that he was not allowed to go to Meerut and hence he had to meet the families of the deceased outside only. Meanwhile, the legal team of Bhim Army will support the deceased, he said in his tweet. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"On Magh Bihu, Noida's Assamese community pays tribute to musician who was killed in NRC protest | Noida News - Times of India","In December 2019, 17-year-old Sam Stafford was hit by a stray bullet during an anti NRC/CAA protest in Assam. The aspiring musician was returning from a concert where noted singer Zubeen Garg performed in solidarity with protesters. A month on, the Assamese community in Noida decided to honour Sam in the one way he would have wanted- through music. On Magh Bihu – the Assamese festival of harvest – the Assam People’s Welfare Association (APWA) in Noida organised a tribute to Sam by inviting his family to a quiet musical celebration at the RWA Community Centre in Sector 119. Geetartha Darshan Baruah, President, APWA, told us, ""Given the tragic deaths back home, we did not want to celebrate but we also did not want to disregard tradition and culture. So we decided to pay tribute to Sam through music on Magh Bihu. This is not a political stand but just a way to say that we, as a community, stand behind his family in these tough times."" Famous Assamese singer Rupam Bhuyan and his band Northeast Breeze performed both traditional Assamese songs and Hindi ballads at the occasion. Sam's father Biju said, ""My son wanted to be a musician. It was his life. So it is heartening to see the community celebrate his life through music.""

Ex-JNU student Umar leads anti-CAA protest | Ranchi News - Times of India,"RANCHI: Former JNU student leader and social activist Umar Khalid on Sunday addressed a large gathering of women here and sought their support in the indefinite dharna planned near Haj House from Monday. The move is similar to the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. The women from different faiths later took an unanimous decision during a mammoth gathering organised under the banner of Samvidhan Bachao Desh Bachao Sangharsh Samity (Save constitution, save country struggle committee) to take part in the protest.  Addressing the gathering at Resaldar Baba Urs ground in Doranda, Khalid, along with clerics of the Muslim community and social activists from 48 different socio-political groups, said the fight against CAA and NRC should not be looked at from the prism of religious myopia. He said, “It is a fight all all such concerned citizens who reposed faith in the Constitution, which guarantees a democratic and secular nation. Religious minorities are small in number and they are going to be affected, but the protests across the country are far bigger than one community.”  He appealed to the masses to join the protest in large number so that a message can be sent to the Centre. “This is a fight between the saffron and the Tricolour. I did my doctoral degree on tribals of Jharkhand and have thorough knowledge of the social fabric here,” Khalid added.  Representing the Sikh community, Inderjeet Singh Namdhari said CAA and NRC are aimed at polarising people so that they can be used as vote banks. “A handful politicians are making efforts to divide society, the way the British had adopted divide and rule policy, but the citizens of the country are mature enough to handle such provocations,” he said.  Convener of the Edara-ESharia general assembly, Maulana Qutubuddin Rizwi, said Jharkhand government should also adopt a resolution in the state assembly on lines of Punjab and Kerala stating the citizenship law will not be implemented in the state. “Chief minister Hemant Soren has assured us that the government would bring a proposal in the state assembly to announce that the people in state are not ready to accept the black law,” he told the gathering.  Separate protests were organised in Jamtara and Pakur on Sunday where people in small and large groups came out with the Tricolour and symbolic copies of the Constitution to show solidarity with the nationwide protests against CAA and NRC. Two such processions were also taken out in Kanke and Bariatu regions here.  Anti-CAA rally in Godda today Congress, RJD and other social organisations will host a mega rally in Godda district on Monday against CAA, NCR and NPR.

Shy homemaker behind Lucknow’s Shaheen Bagh | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Turiaganj resident Kausar Imran describes herself as a shy homemaker who would hardly speak up, let alone attend a protest. That was until Friday, when the 35-year-old began a massive protest at Husainabad’s Clock Tower — now being referred to as Lucknow’s Shaheen Bagh. On Friday afternoon, the mother of three reached the iconic Clock Tower along with her children and 10 other women to launch an agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Over the next three days, hundreds of women joined the motley group of protesters. The growing numbers reminded many of New Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, where local residents have been staging a 24/7 peaceful sit-in for more than a month. Talking about what inspired her to launch the agitation, Kausar said, “My family was discussing what was happening in Shaheen Bagh while watching the news on Thursday evening. Listening to them, I wondered what homemakers like me could do here. My husband then drew similarity between me and the homemakers of Delhi who were participating in the protest. I was cooking dinner when I decided that we would have to do something to save the country.” “My three children, aged six, eight and 13, and my niece who is 24 encouraged me and we stayed up all night making posters,” said Kausar, who has received formal schooling only till fifth standard. The homemaker said that she and her children went door-to-door in her locality seeking support. “We literally begged women to come out. By Friday afternoon, we were some 15 people including the children who stood at the Clock Tower to protest against CAA and NRC.” “We made posters which read ‘we reject CAA, no NRC’ and ‘we are Indians’ and came here after Friday prayers around 2.30pm. Not many people had turned up by then, but we still decided to go ahead,” said 24-year-old Safiya, Kausar’s niece. Hiding the posters in the layers of her burqa, Kausar and others managed to sneak past the police to reach Clock Tower on Friday afternoon. The moment they brought out the posters, police ran towards them to stop them. “I told them that I can tape my mouth and will even turn into a stone, but would not move from the spot. When they told me that I had no permission to protest, I said that I wasn’t creating any ruckus. The electricity supply was snapped in the area that night, but even my youngest did not cry or ask to go home. We sat there undeterred. Now, I feel overwhelmed by sheer number of women sitting with us,” she added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Assam: Himanta Biswa Sarma questions ability of teachers to understand CAA | Guwahati News - Times of India,"GUWAHATI: A day after taking over as the Assam education minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma fired a salvo at college teachers who are agitating against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), asking them if they knew the clauses of the Act properly. Speaking at a youth conclave here, Himanta on Sunday questioned the capabilities of college teachers to understand clauses of the Act, against which there have been protests in the state and across the country. One of the most vocal proponents of the CAA, Himanta said instead of being logical, the college teachers have jumped into the anti-CAA movement emotionally. The Assam government has already ordered principals of all state-run and provincialised colleges to take action against employees who criticise the government. ""I don't have an issue with the college teachers joining the anti-CAA stir. But, how many educational seminars and symposiums have been organised by them to deliberate on CAA? Can they explain the clauses of CAA or amendments made to the Act? The teachers who are agitating should first ask the question if they are well-acquainted to deliver an intellectually stimulating speech on the citizenship law,"" he said. He said the intelligentsia never convened intellectual debates on CAA, which is why a notion was disseminated among the common people that amendments to the Act to grant citizenship to the persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan are harmful. ""The questions being hurled by many surprise us. Had there been discussions at an intellectual level on CAA, no one would have made apprehensions over 2.5 crore people (migrants) entering Assam after CAA comes into force,"" he said. ""Emotions cannot change the future of the community. The future is bright only when we go ahead with logic and attach a certain ideology,"" he added. Anguished over the Centre's decision of enacting the CAA, 2019, some of the college teachers' units affiliated to the Assam College Teachers' Association (ACTA) joined public rallies against the CAA and staged demonstrations on college campuses. Though the ACTA initially drew flak from various quarters for its ""silence"" over the CAA, the apex college teachers' body later had to put the onus of its zonal committees to decide how they will steer the protest against CAA. Criticising ACTA, some of the college teachers' units also resigned from their parent body. However, after ACTA broke its silence, most of the teachers' units decided to take back their resignations.

Madhya Pradesh: Woman IAS officer slaps BJP worker during pro-CAA rally | Bhopal News - Times of India,"BHOPAL: An IAS officer posted as collector in Rajgarh district of Madhya Pradesh got so furious while trying to manage law and order situation during a pro-CAA rally in her area that she slapped a local BJP spokesperson in full public view. Her slap, that was caught on camera, went viral on social media. BJP workers were taking out the rally in Biaora town in violation of section 144 imposed in the district. Police had to resort to lathicharge, injuring three people, to control the situation. This was the second such incident in which the collector – Nidhi Nivedita -- had lost her temper. In one of the previous incidents, she had hogged headlines by making a panchayat secretary do sit-ups as punishment when she was posted as CEO district panchayat in Singrauli district in 2016. Apart from collector, another female officer also slapped a protester, subsequently she was manhandled, kicked and even someone pulled her hairs. Section 144 was imposed in the district on Saturday by district collector, banning all the rallies, processions etc. Despite the ban, BJP workers led by former MLAs Amar Singh Yadav, Mohan Sharma and district president of BJP Dilbar Singh Yadav, took out a ‘tiranga yatra’ in support of CAA in Biaora town on Sunday. Hundreds of workers gathered despite the administration asking them to refrain from taking out any procession as section 144 is imposed. In presence of police district collector, Nidhi Nivedita took control of the situation. Meanwhile, in another video, a female officer is seen slapping a worker, and workers are also seen misbehaving with her and pulling her hair. A worker also kicked her. District collector Nidhi Nivedita said that the protesters had taken law in their hands and were assaulting lady officers which led to the incident. “If people are trying to take law in their hands and they think they are above law, I have been deputed as district collector to upheld law in the district. They had taken out rally despite section 144 was imposed. They took law to be extinct and are seen assaulting women and a female officer on duty, I cannot let the morale of my people down by letting them do whatever they want to do”, Nidhi Nivedita told TOI. She added, “There is a video of the worker who misbehaved with the lady officer. He has been identified and a case is being registered against him”. “Apart from it, so far around 121 people have been identified who violated section 144 and a case under section 188 is being registered against them,” she said. The man who was slapped by the collector says, “The behavior of officer was unbelievable”. “I was telling the collector that CAA has been cleared by president of India, but the way that you are behaving and trying to pull someone is wrong. It was then that she slapped me. It was unbelievable, talks were going on. She is district collector and a female we were respecting her but...”, BJP district media cell in-charge, Ravi Barone who was slapped by collector told TOI. “There was section 144 imposed around 16 hours ago, but we had gathered at a temple and were just trying to take out a peaceful ‘tiranga yatra’,” he said. “Two of our workers Deep Kamal Sharma and Vikas Karode were injured so grievously that they have been referred to Bhopal for treatment in the police lathicharge,” Barone said. Meanwhile, police had registered two separate FIRs. “Two separate FIRs have been registered. One under section 354 (molestation) on the complaint of a female officer that she was kicked, her hair were pulled by a worker. We have identified the accused. Second FIR is registered for violation of section 144. So far 121 people have been identified and booked,” SP Rajgarh Pradeep Sharma told TOI. He added, “We took action as prescribed in the law for bringing the situation under control”.

"Congress should focus on economic crisis, not CAA: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh | Kozhikode News - Times of India","KOZHIKODE: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has said that the Congress party should lead an agitation on the economic crisis gripping the country and not on Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)/National Population Register (NPR) as people see it as a Hindu-Muslim issue and added that the party should not allow the society to be polarized. Speaking on the sidelines of the Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) which concluded here on Sunday, Ramesh said that BJP was waiting for Congress to take up the lead in CAA protests and the party would fall into their trap if it does so. “CAA is a very sensitive issue. We have to be very careful that it does not become an instrument of Hindu- Muslim polarization. BJP wants to keep the debate of CAA/NPR alive while the most important issue in the country today is economic crisis with inflation going up and growth coming down. Congress should lead an agitation on economic crisis and not CAA/ NPR because economic crisis is not a Hindu-Muslim issue whereas people see CAA/NPR as a Hindu-Muslim issue,” he said, when asked about the perception that Congress is not taking the lead nationally on the CAA protests. Referring to the passing of the resolution by Kerala assembly against CAA, Jairam Ramesh said that the state government cannot override CAA and added that any resolution of the state on CAA may not pass the constitutional test. “To the best of my knowledge, citizenship is in the central list and not on the concurrent list. If it was in the concurrent list, the state assembly can override it. Any resolution on CAA may not pass the constitutional test. However on NPR/ NRC, it is a separate issue,” he said. Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal had on Saturday, while participating in the KLF, said that no state can take the stand that it will not implement the CAA. Ramesh said that the Congress party should also be careful not to fall into the CPM trap as well on the issue and added that the party cannot be led by the CPM. “Congress party’s politics cannot be dictated by the CPM. It should not outsource its thinking and should think of its own. Left parties are relevant only in Kerala while Congress is relevant in 29 states and it has to fight the BJP. Pinarayi Vijayan looks only at Kerala politics. Sitaram Yechury looks at national politics but Yechury has more influence in the Congress that in the CPM. It is easier for CPM leaders to meet Rahul Gandhi than for Congress leaders to meet him,” he added. Ramesh said that the only way one can deal with the unconstitutional CAA is by either Parliament passing a new law which will not happen unless Congress gets majority or Supreme Court striking it down. He said that he was the first to approach the SC against the Act. Asked about the role of regional parties in Indian politics, he said that Congress has to learn to deal with regional parties. “Regional parties are a reality and they want respect. One of the mistakes Congress made in 2009 was that when the party got 210 seats it became very arrogant. There was no CMP in UPA-2 while there was CMP in UPA-1. The BJP is now making the same mistakes with regional parties as is reflected in breakup with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra,” he added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Mallikarjun Kharge chides Amit Shah on CAA | Bengaluru News - Times of India,"BENGALURU: Senior Congress functionary and former Union minister Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday criticised BJP national president and Union home minister Amit Shah for saying those opposed to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are anti-Dalit. “It is a misleading comment aimed at fomenting tension among communities.

 Eminent citizens opposing CAA are Mamata Banerjee's dogs: BJP MP | India News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: BJP MP Soumitra Khan on Sunday termed prominent personalities opposing the CAA and the proposed nationwide NRC as ""dogs"" of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Khan, who had joined the saffron party after quitting the Trinamool Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, told reporters that despite knowing the facts about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens, the eminent persons are continuing with their protests. ""The persons who are doing so are dogs of Mamata Banerjee,"" Khan, who represents Bishnupur seat in the Lok Sabha, said. But the same persons remained silent about the gang rape cases at Kamduni and Park Street besides incidents of bomb blasts, he said. Actors, directors and musicians in the state have participated in rallies to protest against the new citizenship law and the proposed NRC. They have also come together in a video against the CAA and the NRC, asserting that they would not show any document if there is a bid by the Centre to submit fresh proof of citizenships. BJP's West Bengal president Dilip Ghosh said on Saturday, ""These days there are so many intellectuals in West Bengal giving 'gyan' to people throughout the day and creating a cacophony. CPM created these intellectuals by bringing them on to the streets and now, 'didimoni' (CM Mamata Banerjee) has created a factory to produce them.""

 All Congress states may pass resolutions against CAA | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Signalling a step up in the political battle over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and to erase confusion over the comments of senior functionaries that not implementing the law might be ""unconstitutional"", Congress on Sunday said all states where it is in office should follow the example of the party government in Punjab in passing anti-CAA resolution in their respective assemblies. The message was beamed by senior Congress functionary Ahmed Patel, who said, ""After Punjab, we are thinking about bringing a resolution against the CAA in states like Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh. It would be a clear message to the central government to reconsider the Act."" The statement came in the backdrop of   comments by senior functionaries Kapil Sibal   and Jairam Ramesh, who expressed doubts over the ability of states not to implement the CAA. A day earlier, Kapil Sibal had said, “If the CAA is passed, no state can say ‘I will not implement it’. It is not possible and is unconstitutional. You can oppose it, you can pass a resolution in the assembly and ask the central government to withdraw it. But constitutionally, saying that I won’t implement it is going to be problematic and going to create more difficulties."" On Sunday, as the party clarified matters, Sibal said on Twitter that he believed CAA was ""unconstitutional"" and every state assembly had the constitutional right to pass a resolution and seek its withdrawal. But he did add, “When and if the law is declared to be constitutional by the Supreme Court, then it will be problematic to oppose it... The fight must go on."" After Kerala, Punjab, now Maharashtra mulls resolution against CAAIn an interaction with a daily, Jairam wondered if the CAA issue might play to BJP’s benefit and said, ""I think one should recognise that there is a space for spontaneous protests by ordinary citizens, students and political parties but on an issue like CAA, there is a dangerous potential for it to be exploited by Modi and Amit Shah — to convert a genuine issue into an issue of communal polarisation."" He also pointed out that he was not sure state governments saying they would not implement CAA would stand judicial scrutiny. “Whether it will stand the test of judicial scrutiny, I am not 100% sure,” he added. Though Congress strongly emphasised its opposition to the CAA and called for resolutions, it stopped short of directing its governments to challenge the Act in the SC, possibly because of uncertainty of the outcome. The party has taken a strong stand against the CAA and the National Population Register (NPR) as well, linking NPR with the National Register of Citizens. While the strategy plays to wooing Muslims and tapping a wider “liberal” sentiment, there is concern over whether it misses a less vocal Hindu consolidation or sympathy for CAA’s political goals. On Sunday, Congress fielded another legal eagle Abhishek Singhvi, who said states challenging the CAA could not be expected to implement a law they have challenged, until the matter was settled by the court. “All that the states have said is they will not implement the law until their challenge of the legislation is settled by the apex court one way or another. It is wrong for BJP to blow this up as a case of non-cooperation or disobedience by the states,” Singhvi said, defending the party’s stand but keeping the tempo down. Commenting on   Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan summoning the chief secretary   over the state government moving the SC against CAA, Singhvi said, “The governor, who occupies a constitutional post, questioning the government is as odd as it would be if the President of India questioned a decision taken by the PM of India and his government. It should be clear who is right or wrong.” So far, the Kerala and Punjab assemblies have passed resolutions against the controversial law, while Kerala has also moved the SC challenging the legislation that seeks to give citizenship to persecuted individuals from three countries on the basis of their religion. Congress’s communications chief Randeep Surjewala called the CAA an “attack” on the Constitution, claiming the people’s movement will continue “courageously and fearlessly”. “PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah have become living symbols of sectarianism, bigotry and fanaticism, using the instrument of state to attack India’s ethos and its Constitution,” he said, invoking the Constitution as India’s biggest ‘dharma’ — of ‘raaj’, ‘neeti’ and ‘karma’. Surjewala’s comments were sharper, reflecting the tenor the party has been adopting and articulated by functionaries like former finance minister P Chidambaram. Earlier this month, Congress had, during a meeting of its working committee, directed Congress-governed states to oppose implementation of NRC and NPR. In a Congress-led meeting of 20 opposition parties, they had also decided, unanimously, to scale up protests against CAA-NRC-NPR across the country.

CAA protest violence: Mangaluru police issue notices to people in Kerala | Mangaluru News - Times of India,"MANGALURU: A 55-year-old woman from Manejshwar never dreamt that she will be called to the police station for an investigation in connection with violence during the recent anti-CAA protests in the city, which led to two people getting killed in police firing, and injured a dozen others. The Mangaluru city police, who are probing the violence during the protest on December 19, have started sending notices to people who were present in the vicinity, after obtaining their details through mobile towers, according to sources. Interestingly, most of the notices were sent to people residing in the border areas of Karnataka and Kerala, and are students, homemakers, government employees, businessmen and others. They claim innocence, saying they frequent areas like Bunder and State Bank for business and other purposes, and were never involved in violence. According to sources, the husband of the woman who was served a notice used to have a SIM card which was registered in her name. Her husband, aged about 60, is a fish seller, who used to come to Bunder to buy fish and later sell the same in Ullal and other places. On December 19, he had come to the fish dock between 6am to 8.30am. “So far, as many as 650 people from border areas of Kerala have been served notices, and the process is on to send notices to 2,000 more people,” added a source.  “This is not a fair investigation, and police should not trouble innocent citizens. Most importantly, they must not target people from a particular area. A lot of people from Kerala come to Mangaluru for various works,” criticised DYFI state president Muneer Katipalla. He added that when he had gone to the police station along with a person, who was served a police notice, he learnt that a lot of students, government employees, bank employees, women and others were queued up. “Police earlier suspected the role of people from Kerala during the violence. Going by the police notices served, it looks likes everything has been done with an ulterior motive,” he alleged. Content of the noticeNotices addressing individuals stated that the police have enough evidence that they were part of the anti-CAA/NRC protest, which turned violent. The incident is being probed. The individual is requested to appear before the investigating officer and if he fails to do so, strict action will be taken, the notices stated. “The case is now being handled by the CID. The investigation officer has sent a notice only after learning that a certain individual was present at the venue on December 19. It is an opportunity for the person who received the notice to appear and assist in the investigation, and explain as to why they were there. It is done in a transparent manner and no innocent person will be harassed. I deny that people were served notices based on data collected from mobile towers,” said P S Harsha, city police commissioner. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"West Bengal: 50-70 lakh infiltrators will be identified, sent back, says Dilip Ghosh | Kolkata News - Times of India","KOLKATA: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said on Sunday 50-70 lakh “infiltrators” would be identified, their names struck off the voters’ list and sent back. He added the government was committed to implementing NRC nationwide and would send back Bangladeshi Muslims living here illegally. Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee said: “They (BJP leaders) are in a fight among themselves to outdo each other. The more they speak, it is better for us, people will get to know them better. They are teaching us Hinduism as if we need to learn from them. CM Mamata Banerjee has always stood up for people’s rights. In doing so, she has never for once thought about their religion, caste and creed. It is for people’s right she is fighting again. They may try to do politics with religion, but they will never succeed in Bengal. Their fight is about exclusivity, ours is about inclusivity.” Ghosh’s comments came on a day his party MP Saumitra Khan termed intellectuals who oppose CAA as Baner-jee’s “dogs”, drawing fire from TMC leaders, who said “BJP leaders are trying to outpace each other in mouthing profanities”. Subodh Sarkar, a recipient of Sahitya Akademi Award, said: “This is the actual language of BJP.

Kolkata: Kids at sit-and-draw lend voice to anti-CAA protests | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: A hijab-clad woman protecting the country from police batons with a ‘NO NRC’ banner finds space on the canvas of a Class-IX student, Sahina Khatoon, at a sit-and-draw competition at Park Circus Maidan, where hundreds of women are protesting against the Citizenship Act, on Sunday morning. More than 200 children, mostly from the Park Circus area, participated in the drawing competition. Sahina said she was moved by the image of Ayesha Renna saving her friend from police brutalities at Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. “The young woman has become the face of anti-CAA protests and it is the women who are leading the protests all over the country. So my drawing is a tribute to the women who showed courage and resistance.” Class-IX student Quratul Aain Anjum drew a politician trying to divide the country on the basis of religion with the implementation of the Citizenship Act and is being chased away by the outburst of spontaneous protests from united India. Class-II student Karotoya Sengupta’s drawing focussed on diversity in culture. She drew a Tricolour and a church, a mosque and a temple with a tag line ‘aamra ek’ (we are one ). “I have been taught in school and home that this country belongs to everyone and we should respect every religion,” said Karotoya, who came from Santoshpur on a Sunday morning. For Md Shahim Shakil, a Class-III student, it was the JNU incident that shook him the most. On Sunday, he decided to put his thoughts on the paper by painting some masked goons barging into JNU and attacking students. Most of the paintings focussed on the Tricolour and slogans like ‘Azaadi’, ‘Halla Bol’, ‘No NRC’, ‘No NPR’ and ‘No CAA’. Kids also drew pictures of Mahatma Gandhi with slogans rejecting the citizenship act. Most of the kids are from the Park Circus area, who have been taking part in the protest and raising slogans from the first day. They are getting first-hand lessons of revolution, feel citizens, who were present at the venue on Sunday morning. The sit-and-draw was organised by a citizen group, ‘Sohomon’ and the topic was ‘My Country’. Sumaan Sengupta, member of ‘Sohomon’, said, “We wanted to channelize their energy into something constructive and engage them in some sort of ‘mindfulness’. It was refreshing to see such positive thoughts in their paintings.” He added that these drawings will be displayed at Park Circus Maidan. Volunteers Subhadeep Das brought crayons and papers for the kids, while Ipsita Sengupta, Sumit Das and Mahasweta Samajdar distributed chocolates and cakes. A poster-making workshop was also held in the afternoon, where more than 200 took part. Earlier on Saturday, a similar workshop was organised by ‘Poster Workshop’ group. Three youngsters — Zara Naaz, Sania Parvin and Meher Parvin — made a poster with a message ‘humein azaadi chahiye’.

The protest rally started from Brown road, passed through Subhani Building area and Shahpur road before culminating at the Jama Masjid in Field Gunj. At the Jama Masjid, the stage was managed by Naib Shahi Imam Maualana Usman Ludhianvi. The protesters were holding placards against the CAA and NRC while some had ‘Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai, Aapas Main Hain Bhai Bhai, written on it. Giving details, Maualana Usman Ludhianvi said student leader of Punjab University Kanupriya, Navdeep Kaur of a Sikh religious channel, apart from thousands of members from Hindu, Sikh, Christian communities participated in the protest rally. He added that women protesters after holding the rally presented a blood written resolution to Shahi Imam Punjab Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi. The Shahi Imam said in the written resolution that the women protesters had vouched that they would strongly oppose the ‘black law’, made as part of a conspiracy to break the Constitution, till the last drop of their blood. He added that in the resolution women protesters have written that they were together in the freedom struggle and no one would be able to break the brotherhood, which reflects unity in diversity. The protesters wrote that refugees were their brothers but not on the basis of religion but on the basis of humanity and ‘Bhartiyata’. They alleged that the government under the garb of refugees was trying to murder democracy but they would not allow it to do so. Student leader Kanpuriya while addressing the protesters alleged that ‘divisive’ forces were trying to break communal harmony and integrity of the country but daughters, sisters and mothers of the country would not allow such ‘agenda’ of the Modi government to succeed. She added that those promising ‘roti, kapda and makaan’ were now asking for proof of citizenship from the people of the country. Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi claimed that Modi government was avoiding the questions of daughters of India. He added that it was unfortunate that despite being in power, the Union government had to organise rallies in favour of law made by it and was hesitating in directly talking to people. On this occasion, Rehnuma Khatoon recited a Nazm (verses) ‘hum dekhenge’ of Faiz Ahmed Faiz whereas Halima Ansari and Gul Afshan recited the poem ‘yeh desh hamara hai’. A protester, Nasreen Sultana, who addressed the gathering in Punjabi took potshots at the ‘wrong’ policies of the central government. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" With netas fishing in CAA troubled waters, fissures in federalism may cost India | India News - Times of India","In the land of the Mahatma, violence is on the throne today. Its victims, among others, are helpless passengers in trains, loyal workers in strike-bound factories, and innocent citizens on riotstricken roads when the bandh-mongers claim the freedom of the city.” This is not a view on the present atmosphere in the country riddled with anti-CAA protests. This was said by Nani A Palkhivala, the unparalleled legal luminary, way back in 1982 referring to the situation prevailing in India then. But these words are apt for today’s India, embittered by violence and political games. Palkhivala’s description of the 1980s India continues to hold even now. “Not since abolition of thuggery by Lord William Bentick in the 1830s has violence characterised our national life on a scale so widespread and so unchecked as today. Our legal system has made life too easy for criminals and too difficult for law-abiding citizens. A touch here and a push there, and India may become ungovernable under the present constitutional set-up,” he had said. Right to protest is undeniably a fundamental right. But this right does not extend to destruction of public property, or to laying siege to roads to violate right to free access of people and rendering India ungovernable. This right does not extend to incite communal feelings. Sadly, these are methods often adopted by protesters and their sympathisers. Worse, even state governments have lent support to such activities. The Kerala government has filed a suit under Article 131 making the Citizenship Amendment Act a Centre-state dispute. Punjab intends to follow suit. Is this in consonance with the federal structure envisaged by our Constitution? Law teachers often said ‘India is a federal republic with a unitary bias’. In state of Rajasthan vs Union of India [1977 AIR 1361], a seven judge SC bench explained, “A conspectus of provisions of our Constitution will indicate that, whatever appearances of a federal structure our Constitution may have, its operations are certainly judged both by the contents of power which a number of its provisions carry with them and the use that has been made of them, more unitary than federal.” Constitution’s principal architect BR Ambedkar, considered India to be “both unitary as well as federal according to the requirements of time and circumstances”. Over the years, the SC has settled the law and most political parties will agree with Palkhivala, who had said, “We do need a strong Union. But a strong Union is in no way inconsistent with strong states. On the contrary, by definition, a strong Union can only be a Union of strong states.” The Left parties and Congress traditionally have had seasoned legal brains. When not in office, these two parties sink their differences and sniff for brewing troubles. Then they do their best to fan it. Remember the unprecedented press conference of ‘senior’ Supreme Court judges led by Justice Jasti Chelameswar in 2018? Left leaders took full advantage of the chinks in the judiciary. They roped in willing legal brains of Congress to peddle canards in active connivance with activist lawyers and intellectuals. Together, they left no stone unturned to ridicule the judiciary, chisel down its stature and make every judge an object of suspicion. The protests against CAA, as long as there is absence of a design to destabilise India through perpetration of violence, must get due space. But what we are witnessing is worrisome as violence has invariably accompanied protests. When India was on the path of industrialisation under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Union government through Parliament enacted a law in 1957 to acquire privately held coalfields, most of which were in West Bengal, to increase coal production. The Bengal government, claiming sovereign control over its land and minerals, moved the apex court with an Article 131 suit challenging the law. The Bengal government argued, “States have within their allotted field full attributes of sovereignty and exercise of authority by Union agencies, legislative or executive, which trenches upon that sovereignty is void.” Rejecting the state’s suit against the Centre [1963 AIR 1241], the SC had said, “The executive power of every state has to be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that state, and not to impede or prejudice the executive power of the Union.” In 2004, when Congress-led UPA was in office at the Centre, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh had filed a suit under Article 131 in the SC challenging the validity of Parliament-enacted MP Reorganisation Act on the issue of division of electricity board assets and dues after carving out of Chhattisgarh from Madhya Pradesh. Disapproving a state government challenging the validity of a Parliament-enacted law through Article 131, the SC in ‘State of MP vs Union Of India’ on August 17, 2011, had said, “Normally, for questions relating to validity of central or other laws, the appropriate forum is the extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution of India in a writ petition and not an original suit filed under Article 131 which vests exclusive jurisdiction of this court as regards disputes enumerated therein.” The Supreme Court will again decide whether suits under Article 131 filed by Kerala challenging CAA, and Chhattisgarh challenging the National Investigation Agency Act, are maintainable in our federal structure of governance.

Latin Church to read out Preamble | Kochi News - Times of India,"Kochi: Latin Catholic Church would observe January 26 as Constitution Protection Day and would read the Preamble of the Constitution after the Sunday service at gatherings of laity and in catechism classes in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The call was made in a pastoral letter issued by the Kerala Region Latin Catholic Bishops’ Council (KRLCBC), which urged the Centre to withdraw the Act. The letter, to be read on January 26, also urged laity to raise the national flag on the day and share thoughts about secular India. “The CAA is against the Constitution. It is not just against Muslims but all of us. So, on January 26, the Preamble would be read out in all the churches under the KRLCBC. Bishops —whichever church they are— would take the National Pledge along with the laity and lead the Preamble readings,” said Kerala Regional Latin Catholic Council (KRLCC) general secretary Fr Francis Xavier Thanikkaparambil. The strong campaign by the Church is coming at a time when the Syro-Malabar Church faced criticism with its own priests terming its stand on CAA soft. Fr Thanikkaparambil said that the Latin Catholic Church is not supporting global terrorism in the name of Islam or ‘Love Jihad’. “Since, a sister Church is saying so, we are not of the opinion that Love Jihad doesn’t exist. But we don’t want to dilute the seriousness about our opposition to the CAA by commenting on such an issue at this point of time. It can be raised at any time,” said Fr Thanikkaparambil. The pastoral letter of KRLCBC also urged its laity to make students and youths aware of the Constitution with a political vision. “Attempts to break the dreams of the architects of the Constitution are increasing in the country. We should develop in our laity an awareness about being a citizen and the duties of being a citizen,” urged the letter, adding that the Church should be leading the awareness campaigns and not street demonstrations.  The letter also stated that united protests were the need of the hour. “...it is getting revealed that what is happening is the preparation for building a theocracy. What we need is a secular India. Our slogan is Bharat Mata Ki Jai,” it said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

 SFI moves SC challenging Citizenship (Amendment) Act | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Students' Federation of India (SFI) has moved the Supreme Court challenging The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, claiming it is ""discriminatory"" in nature and is ""destructive"" for the core principles of Indian constitutionalism. The CAA, which was notified on January 10, grants Indian citizenship to non-Muslim minorities -- Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian -- who migrated to India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014, following persecution over their faith. In its plea, the SFI has sought to declare the CAA ""violative"" of the Indian Constitution, saying ""explicit preference to certain religious groups to the exclusion of others can never, in the Indian constitutional scheme, constitute a valid and reasonable classification meeting the test of Article 14 (equality before law) of the Constitution"". Besides, the plea has sought to strike down certain provisions of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and The Foreigners Act, 1946, claiming that they are violative of the Constitution. ""Student members of the petitioner (SFI) are immensely disturbed by the enactment of The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and view it as being destructive of core principles of Indian constitutionalism,"" the plea said. It said that the Centre, despite being fully aware of the ""protests and disaffection among the masses"" with the CAA, has categorically and unequivocally reiterated its position and stated that there is no question of repeal or amendment of this statute. ""The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution since it discriminates only on the ground of religion, inasmuch as identically situated persons who face persecution in India's neighbourhood stand excluded from the beneficial embrace of the act only because they do not fall within the six religious communities listed in the Act,"" the plea said. On December 18, 2019, the top court had issued a notice to the Centre and sought its response by the second week of January on a batch of pleas challenging the CAA's legality. The apex court had fixed January 22 for hearing several anti-CAA petitions, including those filed by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh. RJD leader Manoj Jha, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi have also filed pleas against the act. Later, Kerala government became the first state to challenge the CAA in the Supreme Court.

 Hope after Sibal's clarification on CAA implementation Punjab CM would behave responsibly: BJP | India News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: A day after Congress leader Kapil Sibal remarked that states can't deny implementation of the amended citizenship law when it has been passed by Parliament, the BJP hoped that Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh would behave responsibly on the issue. Calling the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ""inherently discriminatory"", the Punjab Assembly on Friday adopted a resolution seeking its immediate repeal and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh announced that his government would approach the Supreme Court against it, the second state after Kerala to do so. BJP National Secretary Tarun Chugh claimed that Sibal, one of the top legal experts in the Congress, has made it clear that the stand taken by Amarinder Singh and the resolution passed by the Congress government in Punjab was unconstitutional. He hoped that after the clarification on legal and technical position of the Centre and states by ""none other than Sibal"" the Punjab chief minister would behave responsibly on CAA. ""The amendment (in the Citizenship Act) has been made after getting it through both the houses of Parliament and now no state can say no to it. It will not only be impossible to not implement it in any state but also unconstitutional as the right to citizenship is not state subject. An Act or amendment passed by Parliament is binding for all the states as well as UTs under article 254 of the constitution,"" Chugh said. ""The resolution passed in Punjab Assembly by the Amarinder Singh-led government was not the true representation of the wishes of people of the state but a unilateral decision against their wishes,"" he said in a statement here. Asserting that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act won't affect any Indian citizen, the BJP leader urged Punjab Governor V P Singh Badnore to reject the ""unconstitutional"" resolution and direct the state government to get the amended Act implemented in the state to uphold the constitutional provisions.

RJD is part of the UPA and in the recently concluded Jharkhand assembly election it was part of the grand alliance and won one seat.

""When you come to national politics, I think we all must stand together because this is national legislation. So, we should not be scoring political points. You must know that if the CAA is passed, no state can say 'I will not implement it'. That is not possible. That is unconstitutional. You can oppose it. You can pass a resolution in the Assembly and ask the Central government to withdraw it (to say please withdraw it),"" said Sibal.

 States can't be forced to implement 'unconstitutional' CAA: Congress | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Amid the tussle between the Kerala government and the governor over the Left dispensation approaching the Supreme Court against the CAA, the Congress on Sunday said states have the right to disagree with the Centre and until the issue is resolved in court, they cannot be ""forced"" to implement the ""unconstitutional"" law. The Congress' assertion comes a day after senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said there is no way a state can deny the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) when it is already passed by Parliament. He, however, later asserted that every state assembly has the constitutional right to pass a resolution and seek the amended Citizenship Act's withdrawal, but if the law is declared constitutional by the Supreme Court then it will be problematic to oppose it. ""Let the BJP government and its governors not forget that India is a Union of states. As per the established parliamentary practice, states can disagree with the Union and challenge the same by way of their constitutional right under Article 131 of the Constitution,"" Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a statement. In the past, many states such as Karnataka, Bihar, Rajasthan, just to name a few, have approached the Supreme Court under Article 131 to resolve disputes with the Union of India on a range of issues, he said. ""Until the issue is resolved on a petition moved under Article 131, states cannot be forced to implement an unconstitutional law like the CAA,"" Surjewala said. The people's movement against the CAA shall go on ""courageously and fearlessly"". Citizens, parties and states shall continue to oppose the CAA with determination, he said. Repeated statements being made by Home Minister Amit Shah and governors ""forcing"" the states to implement the CAA are itself preposterous and go against the very concept of 'constitutional federalism', Surjewla said.

"CAA, NRC 'internal matters' of India: Bangladesh PM - Times of India","DUBAI: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has termed as ""internal matters"" of India the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), but at the same time said the Act was ""not necessary"". According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship. Protests are being held across India against the controversial law. ""We don't understand why (the Indian government) did it. It was not necessary,"" Hasina told the Gulf News in an interview, referring to India's new citizenship law. Her comments came weeks after Bangladesh foreign minister AK Abdul Momen said that the CAA and the NRC are India's ""internal issues"", but voiced concern that any ""uncertainty"" in the country is likely to affect its neighbours. Bangladesh, where 10.7 per cent of the 161 million population is Hindu and 0.6 per cent Buddhist, has denied any migration to India because of religious persecution, the paper said. Hasina, who is in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, also said that there has been no recorded reverse migration from India. ""No, there is no reverse migration from India. But within India, people are facing many problems,"" she said. ""(Still), it is an internal affair,"" Hasina said. ""Bangladesh has always maintained that the CAA and NRC are internal matters of India,"" Hasina said. ""The government of India, on their part, has also repeatedly maintained that the NRC is an internal exercise of India and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has in person assured me of the same during my visit to New Delhi in October 2019."" She said the relationship between Bangladesh and India is currently at its best, with cooperation in a ""wide spectrum of areas"". The NRC has been prepared to identify genuine Indian citizens living in Assam since March 24, 1971, or before, and identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants in the state.

" It is not legal if states refuse to implement CAA, Nirmala Sitharaman says | India News - Times of India","CHENNAI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said states cannot refuse to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as their refusal “is not legal and is against the Constitution.” Participating in a discussion here on the CAA organised by the Chennai Citizens’ Forum and New India Forum, the minister said, “Political parties can make a political statement by passing resolutions against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. But, states cannot refuse to implement the CAA.” She said there was an attempt by the opposition to distort the truth and create fear about the CAA. “Every question that the opposition raised in Parliament about the CAA was answered. But, despite that, they are hell-bent on politicising it outside the House,” Sitharaman said. “The CAA is to offer citizenship and not to deny citizenship to anyone. It is to give citizenship to some groups of people, who did not get it earlier and have spent nearly 60 years in camps, and not to reject it to anyone. We are willing to explain this to even that segment of people, who fear that their citizenship will be taken away,” Sitharaman said. Reeling out statistics issued by the Union home ministry, the minister said 391 Afghans and 1,595 Pakistanis had been given citizenship in the last two years. In the last six years, 2,838 Pakistanis, 914 Afghans and 172 Bangladeshis had been given citizenship. “Obviously, they include Muslims too,” Sitharaman said. Referring to the pitiable conditions under which refugees live in camps which don’ have even basic amenities, she said those were the people who had come to India from the then East Pakistan, which later became Bangladesh. “People like them had to be given citizenship and hence the amendment to the Citizenship Act,” she said. She said the condition was very pitiable in camps where Sri Lankan Tamils live. “Political parties raising the issue for not granting citizenship (to Sri Lankan Tamil) will not talk about these. No human rights organisation will speak about them. Since 1964, more than four lakh Sri Lankans have been granted citizenship. Sri Lankan Tamils living in camps, around 95,000 of them, too will be given citizenship in the coming years,” she said. Stating that the CAA had nothing to do with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR), the minister said the NRC had been implemented in Assam as per the directions of the Supreme Court. “There have been no talks about the NRC being implemented across India and the process will be the same as done in Assam. There have been no talks at all,” she said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 States opposing CAA implementation is 'unconstitutional': Nirmala Sitharaman | India News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday dubbed the proposal of some states to not implement the Citizenship Amendment Act as 'unconstitutional' and said it was the responsibility of all states to ensure that the law passed in Parliament is executed. ""A state assembly has passed a resolution against CAA. It is like making a political statement. We can understand that. But saying they will not implement it, then it is against the law. It is unconstitutional to say that"", she said. Sitharaman was responding to a query from among the audience at an event on CAA, organised by Chennai Citizens' Forum,that some states like Kerala have opposed implementation of the CAA in their respective states. ""A state assembly can pass resolution that they will not implement CAA. It is a political statement. They can go ahead and we will not say no to that. Everybody in this country has the responsibility to implement the law which has been passed in Parliament,"", the minister, who is here as part of BJP's nationwide 'Jan Jagran Abhiyan' campaign in support of the Act, said. The Kerala government last week moved the Supreme Court against the CAA, seeking to declare it ""violative of the principles of equality, freedom and secularism enshrined in the Constitution"".

West Bengal: Dilip Ghosh denied entry to Nandigram | Kolkata News - Times of India,"NANDIGRAM: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh was prevented from taking out a rally in support of the new citizenship law in East Midnapore’s Nandigram on Saturday. Police stopped his car at Reyapara, 10km ahead of Nandigram town on the Chandipur-Nandigram Road. BJP had organised the “avinandan yatra” as part of its outreach programme in view of the countrywide protests against CAA-NPR-NRC. Police placed barricades at entry points and closed ferry services since morning, cutting off the entire area. Around 11.30am, a huge police force reached Tengua More and told BJP supporters who had assembled for the yatra that there was no permission to hold the rally. The administration had issued prohibitive orders in the area because of the mounting tension over CAA, the police said. This soon led to a scuffle as cops pulled the party’s district general secretary by the collar in an effort to disperse the crowd. A section of BJP supporters alleged that police lathicharged the gathering. Ghosh, who was coming from Kolkata, was stopped at Reyapara citing trouble in Nandigram. He mocked the cops, but didn’t break the police barricade. “The duty of the West Bengal police is to ignore illegal immigrants. I could have broken the police barricade. But I didn’t. Police instead roughed up our party district president and pulled the district general secretary by the collar. They did all these even after our partymen wrote to the SP seeking permission for the rally a fortnight ago. I won’t forget the police assault on our party workers. I will come back to Nandigram and hold the rally,” he said. Taking a dig at the police, Ghosh said: “It appears that Nandigram is outside India. It seems as if the Constitution doesn’t apply here.” Trinamool senior and minister Subrata Mukherjee said: “Police will prevent people from holding rallies if they don’t take permission. There have been so many rallies in the state. Police are not stopping them.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Jaipur’s Shaheen Bagh act: Women surge in scores to stir against CAA | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: Jaipur continues to live its Shaheen Bagh moment at the iconic Albert Hall. The series of ongoing protests happening every day since January 5, scaled up on Saturday with over 5,000 turning up for an all-women protest in the city. The anti-CAA-NPR-NRC agitation was led by student leaders from Jamia Milia Islamia (JMI), Aligarh Muslim University and Jawaharlal Nehru University, along with local leaders. JMI’s student Ayesha Raina, who became the face of Jamia protests for facing a baton while saving a man, stormed the audience with her fierce speech laced with poetry and slogans. She urged Jaipur’s women to stand like a rock against the ‘divisive’ and ‘draconian’ citizenship law, like the women in Shaheen Bagh. “Dear sisters and mothers, those who say we are creating chaos on the roads, you tell them that you are scripting history by fighting for protecting the basic tenets of our Constitution. Continue this fight till we succeed,” said Raina. The 2.5-hour protest session that started at 11am, saw poetry recitation sessions and songs played by local women and activists in between the speakers. The popular slogans — ‘Hum lekar rahenge Azadi...garibi se, manuvad se, fasiwad se (We will free India from poverty, Manu-ism and fascism), Inquilab Zindabad (long live revolution), Hum Dekhenge (we will see) — resonated in the entire Ramnivas Garden area which houses Albert Hall. AMU’s Wardha Beg clad in a burkha asked the protesting women to never hesitate in raising their voices against injustice. “I am proud of the fact that Muslim women are at the fore safeguarding the very ethos of our country. Our PM, Modi has said that protesters can be identified by their clothes, which should be taken as a badge of honour,” said Beg. The protesters — comprising toddlers, students, housewives and grannies — made their way from the narrow alleys of the Walled City, braving the cold, with temperature being close to 18 degree Celsius. Most of these women were in hijab or burkha holding banners and the national flag, while actively reciprocating to the call of slogans and applauded the speeches. All India Muslim Personal Law board member Yasmeen Farooqui, who was one of the main speakers, was spellbound to see the huge attendance of women. “This is the biggest gathering ever since the protest started here. Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protest has given a lot of confidence to the protesting women who come from orthodox families. I should thank PM Narendra Modi for waking up the country’s most socially, politically and economically disadvantaged groups,” said Farooqui. The protests here have been going on since January 5, everyday from 5pm to 7pm. The organizers, taking a queue from Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, organised an all-women’s protest in the city.

To avoid detection, Sajid hid the pistol in the graveyard.” The anti-CAA protests had turned violent in eight cities of Bijnor district. Nahtaur and Bijnor cities were worst affected. In Nehtaur, two persons were killed in firing. SI Kumar’s pistol was snatched during the protests in Nehtaur. Police have so far registered 34 cases and arrested 149 protesters.

" Arvind Kejriwal's 'subdued' response to CAA-NPR-NRC, Jamia-JNU violence 'smacks of opportunism': Kapil Sibal | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Asserting that the uproar over the amended citizenship law and the Jamia-JNU violence will be a major factor in the Delhi assembly polls, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Sunday said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's ""subdued"" response to the issues ""smacks of opportunism"". He also said the Congress will play a ""significant"" role in the polls and exuded confidence that the party could get enough seats to emerge as the ""determining factor"" in government formation. ""He (Kejriwal) did not show up in Jamia (Millia Islamia), he did not show up in JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University). His statements were not frequent enough, strong enough and open enough,"" Sibal told PTI in an interview. He said Kejriwal's somewhat ""subdued"" response to what has been happening around has not sent the right kind of signals. ""It smacks of opportunism,"" said the Rajya Sabha MP, who is a member of the Congress' election and campaign committees for the Delhi polls. Asked if the massive uproar over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the violence on university campuses will be a major factor in the polls, Sibal replied in the affirmative. ""What has Kejriwal done? Kejriwal has not even visited the campuses, not even visited JNU, because this is politics,"" he said. ""This is the problem when political parties take positions only for the purpose of an election, not for the purpose of what is right. People see through their acts,"" the former Union minister said. Sibal also alleged that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was not talking much about CAA, NPR and NRC for the fear of losing a section of a vote bank that it ""desperately needs"". He asserted that Kejriwal has to answer to the people for his response to CAA, NPR and NRC. Asked if the Congress can form the government on its own, Sibal said, ""I don't think that we should be making such tall claims, but at the same time I think we will be a significant factor in this election, maybe giving us enough seats to be the determining factor in the formation of the government."" On whether the Congress can join hands with the AAP if it turns out to be the ""determining factor"", he said, ""Let us first get the results out in the open. What our strategy is will be known to everybody at that point in time."" Sibal also dismissed suggestions that the Congress' chances in the polls may be hampered by the absence of a popular and credible face, saying the credibility of a face has no relationship to the party's credibility in terms of its functioning on the ground. ""In 2014, we had a credible face in (Narendra) Modi ji, that is what the people of India thought, see what has happened since then. So let us not talk about the faces. The face of the common man is far more important than the face of the chief minister,"" he asserted. It is only the Congress party that has always looked at the face of the common man or woman and worked towards his or her concerns, said Sibal, who has been elected to the Lok Sabha twice in the past from Delhi's Chandni Chowk constituency. Responding to a question about the Congress mounting a formidable challenge to the AAP, Sibal said his party does not have any seats in the Delhi assembly, so the ruling party certainly has an advantage. ""I think they (AAP) claim more than what they have done on the ground. They have a fabulous media campaign. This is somewhat like our Prime Minister's media campaign which sort of tries to claim much more than what the reality is. I think the people know the reality. So let's see what happens,"" he said. The Congress leader claimed that the BJP is on a sticky wicket in the polls as it has ""lost credibility"" and people are very unhappy with it. He cited the examples of Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, in which the poll pundits were proved wrong, to stress that a surprise could be in the offing in Delhi and his party could deliver a strong performance in the polls. ""I think the people of Delhi, as a member Parliament and (someone) who has fought elections in Delhi I can say, have realised that it is the Congress party that has delivered in Delhi. There is no other party that has delivered in Delhi. As far as AAP is concerned, it has been in constant conflict with the Centre,"" Sibal said. ""I remember the days when Sheila (Dikshit) ji was the chief minister and (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister. Even though we were different political parties with different ideologies, the administration worked together,"" he said. This talks well of Vajpayee's administration and Dikshit's quality to embrace everyone and get the work of the people of Delhi going, he said, adding that, Kejriwal doesn't have that art. ""In a constant state of conflict, I don't think you can achieve much. I want to know how many great bridges have been built, how many underpasses have been built (under the AAP government). There is no infrastructure development at all,"" Sibal alleged. All the schemes that have been taken forward in Delhi have been the brainchild of the Congress, he said. Polling will be held on February 8 for the 70-member Delhi assembly and the results will be declared on February 11. The Congress is seeking to revive its fortunes in the national capital this time. It had won just eight seats in 2013 and drawn a blank in the 2015 Delhi assembly polls. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Braving the winter chill and fog, the Husainabad resident was among a number of elderly women who had left their homes on Friday afternoon and spent the night in the open at Clock Tower to oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise. Inspired by the women in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, these first-time protesters, some along with their grandchildren, say that they will not move until their demand for revocation of CAA is not met. “My parents and grandparents were born in India and they did not leave any papers for us to show to the government. We have assembled with our children and it is our fight for our rights,” she said, referring to NRC. Ishat Jahan, 75, said she was protesting to support her nephew and many others arrested on December 19 after a protest against CAA in Lucknow had turned violent. By evening, women from all faiths and ages had started to gather, pushing the number to 300. In the evening, some members of the Sikh community distributed tea and snacks among the people. Holding posters of Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh, women raised slogans of ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and Ram Prasad Bismil’s ‘sarfaroshi ki tamanna’. Youngsters brought them food, tea, quilts and warm clothes. “Police tried to stop us yesterday when electricity was snapped and public toilets were locked. A few people offered us their toilets to use. Today, they stopped men and even young boys from joining us. Since we do not want any violence, we appealed to them to stay back,” said Rahila, a protester. Late in the evening, police personnel reached the site and allegedly took away blankets and water bottles form the women at the dharna site. Sdditional deputy commissioner of police (west zone) Vikas Tripathi said, “We did not take away any belongings from the protesters. We only stopped those who were setting up tents at the spot because it is not a designated dharna venue. Hence, such arrangements cannot be allowed.” Companies of RAF were also on guard at the spot.

In a statement issued on Saturday, Jain said that this resolution was in utter violation of Article 256 and 257 of the Constitution of India, which impose an obligation on the state governments to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and also gives power to the Government of India to issue directions to any state for that purpose. Satyapal said India is a union of states and has adopted a federal structure which demarcated the powers between the Centre and the states. No one can try to infringe upon the powers of the other, be it Centre or the state. He said that to enact a law on citizenship is within competence and prerogative of the Parliament of India as per Article 11 as well as entry 17 in the ""Union List"" in Schedule 7 of the Constitution. State governments have no role in the passing or implementation of any law about the citizenship of India.

They called it ‘the second freedom movement’. The massive all-women crowd sang patriotic songs and called for solidarity with protesters across the country and with students of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia and other colleges. Kanaka Chavan, a designer, told TOI the continuous struggle is unreal. “How is the government dismissing such a widespread movement as an opposition tool? They are underestimating the power of people’s logic and overestimating the opposition’s grasp. They must stop being in denial and see the reality,” said Kanaka, who took half-day leave from work to participate in the protest. Some like Amreen and Sara, both homemakers, left behind their children as young as two, to lend their voice to the stir. “We might be perceived to be conservative, but here we are stepping outside our homes, protesting for what is right,” said Sara. Her relative Amreen said Kerala has shown the way by passing an anti-CAA resolution and they want Karnataka to follow suit. “They think we know nothing and are out protesting just like that. The truth is, they underestimate us because of the purdah, but it’s no hurdle to progressive thinking. We are well-read and understand the divisive act and how the community is being sidelined,” said Abida Begum, also a homemaker. She added that they are against anything that divides people and that they want ‘Azadi from CAA’. “In a way, this is the second freedom struggle,” Abida said. Khurath, a teacher, added that soon there’ll also be a civil disobedience movement. “We will not show any papers for NPR or anything related. There will be complete disobedience in such matters,” she said.

Khurath and Abida said the government must focus on education, economy and employment rather than legislations that reflect ‘divisive’ ideologies. “The Constitution is what protects us and we will fight for it.

Congress stand against CAA shows it is anti-Christian also: Smriti Irani | Varanasi News - Times of India,"VARANASI: Union minister Smriti Irani said it was well known till now that Congress party was anti-Hindi and anti-Sikh, but it has now proved to have become anti-Christian also by opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Addressing BJP cadres and supporters at Sampurnanand Sanskrit University ground in Varanasi on Saturday, Irani said, “Congress chief Sonia Gandhi never made any comment when places of worship of Christians were attacked in Pakistan, although she had time to shed tears on Batla House encounter. Nobody knew that Congress will also stand against Christians just like it always used to be against Hindus and Sikhs.” “The massacre of Kashmiri Pandits and brutalities against them in Kashmir had started on January 19, 1990 and it is a coincidence that I am addressing this rally on the eve of such an unfortunate date. The cries of the families, women and girls, who were raped and forced to convert and marry, in Pakistan for being minority were never heard by Congress.” Questioning Congress leaders for opposing CAA, she said former PM Manmohan Singh and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gahlot supported granting citizenship to minorities from Pakistan, who had taken shelter in India. “Congress is opposing CAA now just because PM Narendra Modi gave a helping hand to the minorities facing persecution in neighbouring countries,” she said. She asked the Congress to explain why it is sympathetic towards Pakistan by promoting mobs to attack police and damage public property. Targeting Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra without taking her name, Irani said, “A parachute politician had come to Varanasi to protest against CAA but showed her dual character when she was seen performing namaz in Bareilly after offering prayers at a temple in Varanasi. During 2019 Lok Sabha elections, she kept asking people when they asked her to do so.” Slamming Rahul Gandhi for his remarks against Savarkar, Irani said he can’t match his courage even after taking 10 births. “Rahul Gandhi recently said he will not apologize, since he is not Rahul Savarkar. I want to tell Rahul Gandhi today that you will not be able to match the courage of Savarkar even after you take 10 births,” she said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Social relations affected by CAA, Sushant Singh says at Jamia Millia Islamia | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Narrating the tale of Musharraf Ali, the 30-year-old who died in the Anaj Mandi fire in Delhi after a desperate phone conversation with his friend Shobhit Agarwal, actor Sushant Singh said this tragic incident underlined Hindu-Muslim unity in the country. Now, he said, the newly notified Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), jeopardised this relationship between the two communities. Singh was speaking to the crowd gathered Jamia Millia Islamia, where he had come to support the protest against the new citizenship law. The actor has been among the most vocal of Hindi film industry figures to denounce CAA and the National Register of Citizens. Singh was at Jamia with his wife Molina Singh. Addressing the protest, which was in its 37th day on Saturday, Singh, said, “The fire in the illegal factory at Anaj Mandi, which killed 43 people, was, for me, the trigger of thoughts. It is a story of what happens in our country. The story is about two people from Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. I am also from Bijnor. Musharraf, a Muslim, with his last breath, remembered his Hindu friend and left his family in his care. This is the story about all of us and the way we have lived in India. This is how we have to go ahead.” His wife narrated how news of the police action in the university on December 15 had deeply disturbed the actor. Provoked, he went to a protest called by students in Mumbai the following day. “It was my 50th birthday that day. I had planned to celebrate it nicely, but Sushant was disturbed,” Molina Singh said. “So I asked him what he wanted to do. He told me he wanted to participate in the protest. I agreed, but told him not to talk much because it is the students’ voices that have to be heard.” Singh admitted to being shocked by December 15 and deciding that the criticism of CAA and NRC had to become louder. “There is one thing we have to remember: hatred between Hindus and Muslims has always existed. We handled this by wearing a mask of secularism. But with CAA, even this mask has been ripped off,” the actor said. Evan as Singh spoke, protesters were writing postcards to Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, requesting him to issue directions for the scrapping of the Citizenship Amendment Act, activist Farah Naqvi, Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac, Congress MP MV Rajeev Gowda and martyr Bhagat Singh’s nephew Jagmohan Singh also spoke to the protestors.

" Amit Shah attacks Congress, brands opponents of CAA ‘anti-Dalit’ | India News - Times of India","HUBBALLI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday dubbed those opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act “anti-Dalit” and sought to assuage the fears of Muslims, saying CAA was all about including people, not excluding anyone or any community. Addressing a public meeting here in this Karnataka town as part of BJP’s nationwide Jan Jagran Abhiyan, Shah said since 70% of refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan in India were from Dalit communities, those opposing it were anti-Dalit. “I want to ask anti-CAA protesters: What benefit will you derive from protesting against these poor Dalits?” He said Muslims of India had nothing to worry about as the Act clearly said it wouldn’t grant citizenship to Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Taking potshots at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi several times, he said: “I challenge Rahul Gandhi to prove CAA will take away citizenship of Muslims... please read the Act completely and if you find anything that takes away citizenship of Indian Muslims, Pralhad Joshi (Union parliamentary affairs minister) is ready to debate with you.” Justifying CAA implementation, he said the population of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains in countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh had dwindled to a meagre 3%. “Can Rahul baba explain what happened to these people in Pakistan and Bangladesh,” Shah asked, adding that he should be thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for fulfilling his grandfather’s dream. “Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Acharya Kriplani and Maulana Azad had originally mooted the idea of CAA. Now, Modi has actually turned their dream into reality,’’ he said, adding that even Mahatma Gandhi had wished according citizenship to minorities of neighbouring countries. Shah slammed Congress and other opposition parties, saying they were always against national issues like CAA, abrogation of Article 370, construction of Ram Mandir... They were all speaking the language of Pakistan and like Pakistani PM Imran Khan, were asking for proof of the surgical strike carried out by the Indian Air Force in Balakot. Defending police action against anti-CAA protesters, Shah said it was important to punish people who allegedly raised “anti-national slogans”. “A few years ago, anti-Indian slogans were chanted at JNU. Should we not punish these anti-Indian people,” he asked. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who attended the meeting, told the gathering: “We’ll work together under the leadership of Modi and Shah to strengthen the party at the booth level. We’ll give priority to irrigation in the interest of farmers. As we’re working for the people, we’ll definitely get support in the next election.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Ambedkar on Saturday said the bandh call has received support from 35 organizations. “All these organizations will participate in the bandh against the Union government, which was attempting to terrorize citizens and was acting against constitutional rights,” he said. Ambedkar said the protest was also against BJP’s failure to tackle prevailing severe economic crisis in the country. “We want to make citizens aware about the social and economic challenges that the country is going to face because of the BJP’s undemocratic style of functioning. The bandh will be held in a peaceful manner,” he said. Asked if the NCP and Congress would join the bandh, Ambedkar said he wanted everyone to rise against the government’s stand. “The government cannot take decisions in an abrupt manner. The issue is not only confined to Muslims, but also a large Hindu population who will be affected because of NRC and CAA,” he said. He said the government should explain if it had adequate money to run the system.

"Former Madras HC judge slams Modi, Shah over citizenship amendment act | Trichy News - Times of India","Trichy: Strongly criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah over the citizenship amendment act (CAA), former judge of Madras high court K Chandru has said that people now have a clear understanding about the Constitution of India which posed a serious challenge to the BJP government. “Modi and Shah have to face the challenges because people who gave them the Constitution have now taken it on their hand and are protesting against CAA,” said Chandru at a programme organised by an organisation called Vaanam here on Saturday. Speaking on “challenges being faced by the Constitution”, the former judge accused Modi and Shah of working on an agenda to create hindutva rule. “Constitution clearly says those born in India, born to the parents born in India are Indian citizens. In the name of national register of citizens (NRC), they are going to waste public money,” he said. On the protests in Assam over CAA, Chandru said it had a different angle as they opposed the BJP government’s move to include 12 lakh Hindus from the 19 lakh people including Muslims who were excluded from the national register of citizens.

"Experts decode CAA, NRC for common man | Kolkata News - Times of India","Kolkata: Mohammad Sanaullah, a decorated Indian soldier, was serving in Manipur as a part of Operation Hifazat, a counter insurgency operation, when the Assam Border Police prepared a report, declaring him a foreigner in 2008. This, in spite of him furnishing records that he had served in the Indian Army for 30 years, recounted Sanaullah’s lawyer Aman Wadud at a workshop held in the city on Sunday to educate people about the nuances of CAA and NRC. Wadud, a human rights activist from Guawahati, pointed out how thousands of families were rendered without home, dignity and identity, merely at the click of a mouse. Case in point, he said, was Suren Biswas, who did not make it to the NRC, because his name was erroneously spelt ‘Surendra’ in one of his documents. Notices were sent to his family, declaring them all, including wife and children, foreigners. Several such cases of people being left out of the NRC list in Assam were pointed out at the capacity-building workshop, organized by NGO Know Your Neighbour, which works on strengthening bonds among citizens. Jhuma Sen, assistant professor and assistant director at Centre for Human Rights Studies, Jindal Global Law School, said the new citizenship law discriminated against people on the basis of their religions, and that the proposed NPR and NRC would affect many. Stating that several myths were being peddled by CAA and NRC supporters to misguide people, Sen said, “The Centre is telling us CAA, NRC and NPR are not linked, and that NPR is like a census. They are claiming NPR and NRC are unrelated. But NPR is actually a pre-condition for NRC. Amendment to the Citizenship Act in 2003 states local register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification from the population register.” The combination of CAA and NRC would help the government shift the goal post for a particular community, she said. Several people in the audience asked about their constitutional rights and how the combination of CAA and NRC threatened their citizenship. The CAA provided for citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsi from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who sought refuge in India before 2015 but left out Muslims from those countries. The NRC would require every India to prove his/her citizenship, failing which, they might be declared illegal migrants. The CAA and NRC together is feared to filter out many, mostly, Muslims. “No guidelines were followed while preparing NRC. Officers randomly sent notices to poor people to prove their citizenship. Many of them sold their homes and cattle to travel to the foreign tribunals and pay lawyers. Those failing to make it were declared foreigners ex parte. Bona fide citizens were dragged to detention camps because their names were erroneously spelt. Many spent more than a decade in detention camps, but it could not be proved that they were illegal immigrants,” said Wadud. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

4k women protesters step out for ‘second freedom struggle’ | Bengaluru News - Times of India,"Bengaluru: At least 4,000 women gathered at Eidgah-E-Jadeed on Tannery Road on Saturday to stage a protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population of Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). They called it ‘the second freedom movement’. The massive all-women crowd sang patriotic songs and called for solidarity with protesters across the country and with students of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia and other colleges. Kanaka Chavan, a designer, told TOI the continuous struggle is unreal. “How is the government dismissing such a widespread movement as an Opposition tool? They are underestimating the power of people’s logic and overestimating Opposition’s grasp. They must stop being in denial and see the reality,” said Kanaka, who took half-day leave from work to participate in the protest. Some like Amreen and Sara, both homemakers, left behind their children as young as two, to lend their voice to the stir. “We might be perceived to be conservative, but here we are stepping outside our homes, protesting for what is right,” said Sara. Her relative Amreen said Kerala has shown the way by passing an anti-CAA resolution and they want Karnataka to follow suit. “They think we know nothing and are out protesting just like that. The truth is, they underestimate us because of the ‘purdah’, but it’s no hurdle to progressive thoughts. We are well-read and understand the divisive act and how the community is being sidelined,” said Abida Begum, also a homemaker, said saying that they are against anything that divides people and that they want ‘Azaadi from CAA’. “In a way, this is the second freedom struggle,” Abida said. Khurath, a teacher, added that soon there’ll also be a civil disobedience movement. “We will not show any papers for NPR or anything related. There will be complete disobedience in such matters,” she said. Talat Yasmeen, the state general secretary of Welfare Party of India, said this is not just for one community, but for all the oppressed sections of the country. “It’s to protect our Constitution and our rights,” said Talat. Khurath and Abida said the government must focus on education, economy and employment rather than legislations that reflect ‘divisive’ ideologies. “The Constitution is what protects us and we will fight for it. The combination of CAA, NRC and NPR will be devastating for millions people,” said MD Pallavi, a singer by profession.

" It’s student anger, no end in sight, Kamal Nath warns on CAA | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath has warned BJP that there appears no end in sight for the seemingly unceasing protests against the CAA-NRC-NPR, saying that the agitation is in the hands of students who are angry over not just the divisive policies of the central government but also the economic collapse. In an interview with TOI, Nath said, “It is difficult to say how long will the agitation continue once the students’ unrest starts. It shows their anger. The Citizen (Amendment) Act is only one manifestation of their anger. There are many reasons for their angst, the key being the prospect of a bleak future, their reduced purchasing power.” Nath said the “divisive” CAA-NRC was cleverly introduced by the Modi government to divert attention from the economic mess but the tactic has compounded the anger of the people. “It has been brought to divide the society and divert attention of people from a collapsed economy. But people of India are realising the motive of the BJP government They will not be thugged,” he said, adding: “The government is not talking about farmers, small business or traders. The fact is there is a complete collapse of economy and economic activity is at its lowest ebb.” The comments from the CM of a state known as BJP stronghold suggest that the political class is not anticipating an end to the issue which has roiled the society and reduced the national debate to a single issue. However, there appears a bid by the Congress-led opposition to frame the CAA as a diversionary tactic of BJP, in a bid to divide the frame with politically beneficial and less polarising economic slowdown. It was also one of the major suggestions made in the recent meeting of Congress Working Committee and in of the opposition parties’ brainstorming last week. “Is there a war going on? People have Aadhaar numbers, ration cards. What was the desperation to rock the boat?” he asked. Strongly backing the opposition to CAA, the Congress veteran said contents of the law as well as omissions in it are dangerous for the society. “What is in the Act is bad but what is not in it makes it even worse. There are no safeguards in the law. People will not have documents like birth certificates of their father to prove their religion. And anyone can claim to belong to any religion or he can be wrongfully ascribed a religion,” he argued, suggesting that people would be at the mercy of officials in-charge of the exercise to identify citizens.  Nath said BJP will use the Union budget to further distract people. “I expect the budget to be a desperate one which will promise many things but nothing will be executed or be executable,” he said.

UP: Burqa clad women booked by Aligarh police for protesting against CAA | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: The Aligarh police on Saturday registered a case against 70 burqa clad unidentified women for taking out a protest march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the city on Friday after namaz. Later, two youths were also arrested by the police for provoking the women to hold the protest. According to police, the women were booked under section 188 of IPC as they had violated prohibitory orders (section 144 of CrPC), which was imposed in the city. The women earlier sat on protest opposite to Jamalpur Eidgah but they were removed by the police. After few hours, they started the protest march from Khwaja Haleem Ki kothi to Dodpur and shouted slogans against CAA/NRC. They were also inviting local residents to participate in the march, said police. Circle officer, civil lines, Anil Samaniya said that the arrested youths, Mohd Sajid and Mohd Adil, in the age group of 20s, were booked under section 151 (preventive arrest) of CrPC.

 No state can deny implementation of CAA: Congress leader Kapil Sibal | India News - Times of India,"KOZHIKODE: There is no way a state can deny the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) when it is already passed by Parliament, said Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday, who claimed that doing so would be ""unconstitutional"". ""If the CAA is passed no state can say 'I will not implement it'. It is not possible and is unconstitutional. You can oppose it, you can pass a resolution in the Assembly and ask the central government to withdraw it. ""But constitutionally saying that I won't implement it is going to be problematic and going to create more difficulties,"" said the former minister of law and justice on the third day of the Kerala Literature Festival (KLF). The Kerala government earlier this week moved the Supreme Court against the CAA, seeking to declare it ""violative of the principles of equality, freedom and secularism enshrined in the Constitution"". It was the first state government to challenge the act and the Kerala assembly was the first to pass a resolution against the law. Following in the southern state's footsteps, the Punjab assembly on Friday passed a resolution demanding to scrap the contentious law. Several state governments including Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra have voiced their disagreement with the CAA as well as National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR). The senior lawyer-politician explained what states mean when they say ""they won't implement it"" and how they wish to do that. ""...The NRC is based on the NPR, and the NPR is to be implemented by the local registrar. Now the local registrar has to be appointed at the level of the community in which that enumerations is to take place and those have to be the state level officers. ""So what is being said is that we would not allow a state level officer to cooperate with the Union of India. That is what is being said, practically if this is possible or not I am not sure. But constitutionally it would be very difficult for the state govt to say that I will not follow a law passed by Parliament,"" he explained. Describing the ongoing nationwide agitation against the CAA as a battle between ""leader"" and the ""people of India"", the 71-year-old leader said ""thank god"" it was the ""students, poor, and middle-class"" of the country that are leading the movement and not any political party. ""... It is making an impact because globally and within the country the people are realising that this is not politics, this is real. These are students, ordinary and poor middle-class people coming out. They are not connected to any political party. ""People in India are showing their angst, their concerns, their worries about the future of India. Everybody wants development, what has Modi done? He has done his own development rather than development of the country,"" he added.

 Anti-CAA protests: Court asks police to verify if Bhim Army Chief has an office in Delhi | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A court on Saturday asked the Delhi police to verify if Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who has been accused of inciting people during an anti-CAA protest at Jama Masjid here on December 20, has an office in Delhi where he holds weekly meetings. The court had restrained Azad from visiting Delhi for four weeks and directed him to not hold any dharna till the elections in the national capital, while granting him bail in a case related to violent protests at Daryaganj. The Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau directed the police to verify from the Election Commission whether Azad's office in Delhi is an office of a political party and asked them to submit a report by January 21. The court was hearing a plea filed by Azad seeking modification of the conditions imposed on him in his bail order. The plea, filed through advocates Mehmood Pracha and O P Bharti, has claimed that the restrictions on Azad tantamount to violation of his fundamental rights to take active participation in awareness camps and to advise and lead the poor, weak and downtrodden sections of society and minorities. The Bhim Army chief is a leader of the oppressed and depressed sections of society including minorities and was working for their social and political awareness, the plea said, adding that he holds weekly meeting of the society 'Bhim Army Ekta Mission', of which he is the founder, at his local address in Delhi. It further said Azad used to travel throughout the country for the cause and due to the restrictions it would be next to impossible for him to personally appear and report his presence before the Station House Officer of Fatehpur Police Station in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, every Saturday. The plea said he is even unable to visit his own house for months together due to his campaigns. It said that since he was under medical treatment at AIIMS here, in case of emergency it would not be appropriate for him to seek permission of the DCP of Crime Branch, Delhi, every time and would pose a risk to his life. The court, while granting him bail, had earlier also said that before going to Saharanpur if Azad wants to go anywhere, including Jama Masjid, in Delhi till 24 hours, police will escort him there. Special circumstances call for special conditions, the judge had said. During the verdict pronouncement, the lawyer appearing for Azad had said the Bhim Army chief faces threat in Uttar Pradesh. The court had further asked him to meet the SHO of Fatehpur police station every Saturday for next four weeks and thereafter on the last Saturday of every month. Since he was undergoing treatment at AIIMS here for polycythemia, a blood disorder, he is to inform the DCP Crime Branch in Delhi of his schedule and would be escorted here. Azad's outfit had called for a protest march from Jama Masjid to Jantar Mantar against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 20, without police permission.

""Our workers went ahead and met the people and asked them to fill out postcards in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). But in most of the cases, the people themselves handed over the postcards showing their support to the CAA and PM Modi. Today, we have posted 42,000 postcards and there are some 20,000-25,000 more people who will do so on a later date,"" Ranjanaben Bhatt told ANI here. ""The people of Vadodara are with Narendra Modiji, and this is their way of showing their support,"" she added. The CAA grants Indian citizenship to refugees from Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Parsi communities fleeing religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.

Religious torture not to be part of CAA rules: Himanta Biswa Sarma | Guwahati News - Times of India,"GUWAHATI: Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday said religious persecution will not be a criterion for acquiring citizenship under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). He added that CAA rules, which are being framed at the moment, will have adequate measures to detect and stop frauds or converts from Islam from applying for citizenship as Hindus, Jain, Parsis, Christians, Sikhs or Buddhists. Talking to TOI, Himanta said, ""There are three criteria for applying for citizenship. First, one has to be either a Hindu, a Jain, a Parsi, a Christian, a Sikh or a Buddhist. Second, the applicant's country of origin has to be either Bangladesh, Afghanistan or Pakistan. Third, the applicant should have definite proof of residence in India before December, 2014. Religious persecution is not a criterion."" Explaining the significance of the three rules, Himanta added, ""How can an applicant prove that he is a victim of religious persecution or that he has fled his country of origin and entered India owing to fear of religious persecution? To get such proof, a person has to go back to Bangladesh and get a police certificate saying he is a victim of religious persecution there. Why should Bangladesh admit that there is religious persecution?"" Himanta said, ""An applicant will have to present government documents from his country of origin such as a voters' list with his name or provide a certificate from his current refugee camp where he is staying. To prove that he has been living in India before December 2014, he has to provide government documents such as Aadhar card, voters' card, education certificates or bank account details before 2014. He has to give clear and definite proof that he is either a Hindu, Jain, Parsi, Christian, Sikh or a Buddhist."" Himanta, who took part in preliminary discussions with the Union home ministry on the framing of CAA rules on Thursday, added, “All these documents will be verified by our central intelligence agencies. Aasu and some others are saying that getting citizenship will be as easy as submitting an affidavit. But it is not going to be that easy…it’s going to be a serious exercise with safeguards and restrictions. ” He said, “In the amended Act, a new section (6B) has been inserted, which says the central government will put in place conditions, restrictions on an application made for granting a certificate of citizenship.” Earlier, TOI had reported that the Centre, keeping in view the ongoing nationawide anti-CAA protests, may put in place some “not so soft” rules for non-Muslim illegal Bangladeshi migrants to obtain citizenship under CAA in Assam. The Assam government had sent its suggestions to the home ministry for consideration while framing CAA rules. On January 1, CM Sarbananda Sonowal told TOI, “We will ensure Assam’s interests are not hampered in any way. I have informed PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah about the ongoing agitation and the aspirations, fears and feelings of the protesters.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Aadhaar, voter ID are no proof of citizenship: Dilip Ghosh | Kolkata News - Times of India","HOWRAH: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, taking a cue from Union home minister Amit Shah, has said that Aadhaar card and voter ID are no proof of citizenship. “Having an Aadhaar card and voter card doesn’t entitle one to be a citizen,” Ghosh told a party gathering in Howrah on Friday, days after chief minister Mamata Banerjee urged people to get their names correctly enrolled in the voters’ list. “Get your names correctly enrolled in the voters’ list and leave the rest to us,” the CM had said. Ghosh stirred a controversy while taking on Banerjee, who claimed the other day that migrants may asked to produce birth certificates of their parents. “Let those who are not sure about their parents bother about it. They are trying to confuse people. We need not worry,” he said. The comment drew an immediate response from TMC. “I have never seen a politician like Dilip Ghosh in my political career who can stoop to such a low,” TMC’s Baranagar MLA Tapas Ray said. BJP has no right to decide who is a citizen and who isn’t, Ray added. The Bengal BJP president urged people not to listen to what the CM is saying. “Those coming from Bangladesh have to apply for citizenship. The PM will give you three to four months to apply for citizenship under CAA. The application should include the refugee’s name, his father’s name, place (in Bangladesh) from where he came and the date of entry to India. There are some who came in 1975, some in 1980 and some after that. All those who came to India from Bangladesh before December 31, 2014 are eligible to apply. The self-certified application is enough. Please mention the date and place in your application correctly,” Ghosh said. R&AW, during its submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 has stated it will verify the “religious persecution” clause mentioned in the application. Bengal BJP leaders, while backing Ghosh’s view that Aadhaar card and voter card can’t be taken as citizenship proof, didn’t rule out such an inquiry. “Non-Muslims comi-ng from the three countries — Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan — have to make a self-certified application. Now, if somebody makes a complaint against him, the onus lies on the applicant under the Foreigner’s Act, and not on the complainant, to prove that what he mentioned in his application is true. He may be asked to produce documents in support of his claim even if he has an Aadhaar card and voter card,” a Bengal BJP leader said. Ghosh urged people not to worry about the birth certificates of parents. “These are all bunkum. Nobody is going to ask for these. Your applicat-ion is enough. We need not wo-rry,” Ghosh said, after leading a rally from Howrah’s Dumurjala to Howrah Maidan. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Kashipur: Ex-Congress MP signs pro-CAA poster, then blames venue | Dehradun News - Times of India","RUDRAPUR: Two days after former Congress MP, KC Singh Baba, raised a few eyebrows by supporting a pro-CAA campaign held by BJP's youth wing in Kashipur of Udham Singh Nagar district, the two-time MP on Friday blamed the venue for his ""inadvertent"" gesture. Baba claimed that he was actually visiting the Chamunda Devi temple to attend the 'Uttarayani' programme when he ""inadvertently"" signed up on a pro-CAA poster put up by members of the BJP's youth wing on the same premises. The Congress member said that he thought the poster was part of publicity for the festival. On Friday, Congress city unit president, Sandeep Sehgal, announced the suspension of party general secretary Manoj Rai - on disciplinary grounds - for also ""attending the pro-CAA event"", especially since video clips of the poster signing session was widely circulated on social media. Sehgal explained that Rai had been involved in anti-party activities for some time and was part of a recent meeting held by BJP at a hotel for a pro-CAA march. He pointed out that Rai's and Baba's cases should be read differently. ""Rai had been using social media platforms to tarnish the party's image. Indiscipline within the party will not be tolerated. A copy of his suspension has been sent to party's state president Pritam Singh and state party in-charge Anugrah Narayan Singh,"" Sehgal added. Countering the move against him, Rai alleged that he was suspended from the party due to factionalism during party's candidate selection for the councillor's post in last municipal elections. ""I had to face defeat as some party members worked against me,"" he claimed, adding that, ""I did not take part in any BJP programme. I will take up the matter with the party's high command."" However, when asked about Baba signing the pro-CAA campaign, Sehgal said that the senior member was asked about the incident and he explained that he was not at fault, stating that he thought that the poster was part of the 'Uttarayani' programme. A party functionary, on condition of anonymity, said, ""Baba has been attending BJP programmes on a regular basis. But, the party cannot afford to take any action against him. Rai has been made a scapegoat for now."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Resolution against CAA in line with Punjab's secular past | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab minister Brahm Mohindra moved the resolution against CAA in the assembly on Friday and it was debated vociferously before being put to vote by speaker Rana KP Singh at 3.18pm. While Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supported it, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) demanded that instead of revoking CAA, Muslims should not be left out. Pointing out the omission of Muslims and other communities such as Jews from the ambit of citizenship under CAA, the resolution asked for a repeal of the Act ""to avoid any discrimination on the basis of religion in granting citizenship and to ensure equality before law for all religious groups in India"". State finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal was the first to support the resolution, claiming that opposing CAA was in line with the secular history of Punjab. ""The CAA is divisive in nature. Why should Tamils from Lanka, Rohingyas in Burma and Ahmediyas from Pakistan be left out?"" he asked. Participating in the debate, SAD Legislature Party leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon said, ""I want to ask if you are against Sikhs and Hindus. If not, you should have only wanted that Muslims be added to the CAA. Let's not play politics on the issue. There would hardly be 800-900 people affected by it in Punjab. The SAD opposes the resolution (against CAA),"" he said. Leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema announced AAP's support to the Congress government's resolution, saying the Centre's move was ""against the spirit of the Indian Constitution"". He accused BJP of bringing ""unnecessary and divisive"" laws, simply to create an atmosphere of fear among the minority, including the Dalits. BJP MLA Arun Narang said he was against the resolution and in favour of CAA as a false impression was being created against the law despite the high incidence of religious persecution in Pakistan. ""False alarm is being created,"" he said. Punjab minister Charanjit Singh Channi said that the basic structure of the Constitution was being tampered with. ""Today Muslims are being beaten up, tomorrow the Sikhs will be beaten up, then the turn of Dalits will come. CAA is against the unity and integrity of the country,"" he said, demanding a ban on RSS. His cabinet colleague Razia Sultana said the Constitution's founders would have never thought that the cherished ideals enshrined by them would be trampled over in this manner one day, adding that the BJP had persistently been trying to divide people on religious lines. Akalis wanted the House to pass a resolution recommending to the Centre that CAA should be suitably amended to facilitate this relief to the Muslims as well. ""The party wanted the Congress not to oppose the relief given to thousands of Sikh community, as from Afghanistan, but to focus only on securing relief to the Muslims also,"" Dhillon said. SAD later issued a press statement to oppose NRC. ""We strongly oppose any move like the NRC that forces needless hardships on the common people,"" said MLA Bikram Singh Majithia.

CAA protest: BJP leaders from Kerala rally behind governor | Kochi News - Times of India,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As Kerala turns out to be the political epicentre of protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, BJP leaders from Kerala have rallied behind state governor Arif Mohammad Khan who has proved himself to be the most vocal advocate of CAA in the state. Putting his weight behind the governor, Union cabinet minister V Muraleedharan said the governor did nothing wrong by going public about his difference of opinion with the state government. “Nobody is above law. The governor has only reminded the same. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who chose to lock horns with governor, an expert in law and constitution, must be penitent now. He must now be aware about the futility of having so many advisers. The governor needs no support of the Centre. He has the support of the President of India,” Muraleedharan said. Mizoram governor and former BJP state president P S Sreedharan Pillai too expressed support to his Kerala counter part by saying that the governor was only talking sense. Kummanam moves Supreme CourtMeanwhile, BJP former state president Kummanam Rajasekharan approached the Supreme Court on Friday, urging the apex court to direct the Kerala government against utilising public money for challenging a central act. The governor, who is constitutional head in the state, was in favour of the CAA and the state government had kept the governor in dark while filing a suit against the Centre, Kummam told the court. He wanted the SC to direct Kerala government to recoup the expenses for suit from the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues. “There is no legal dispute between Centre and Kerala government with regard to CAA. The difference is only political. The state government has not clarified how the amendment would affect Kerala. The state government also failed to justify its claim that Rohingyan Muslims faced religious persecution”, he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
