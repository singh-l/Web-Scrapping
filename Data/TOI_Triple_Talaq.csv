" Triple talaq law, increasing number of SC judges high points of law ministry in 2019 | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The ban on the practice of instant triple talaq, making it a penal offence and the increase in the strength of Supreme Court judges were two of the major achievements of the law ministry in 2019. In July, Parliament gave its nod to The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019. The new law makes talaq-e-biddat or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband void and illegal. It makes it illegal to pronounce talaq three times in spoken, written or through SMS or WhatsApp or any other electronic chat in one sitting. According to the new law, any Muslim who pronounces the illegal form of talaq upon his wife shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine. During the year, four new judges were appointed to the Supreme Court in September, taking its strength to 34, the highest-ever. However, vacancies in high courts and lower courts are on the rise and convincing state governments and the 25 high courts to come on board to create an all-India judicial service to recruit judges for the subordinate courts tops the agenda of the Law Ministry in 2020. Besides creating a consensus on setting up the All-India Judicial Services, the ministry will also have to focus on filling up vacancies in the high court. On an average, the vacancies stood at 400 throughout this year. With more than 5,000 positions of judicial officers in district and subordinate courts lying vacant, the Law Ministry has pitched for setting up all-India judicial services. The sanctioned strength of the judicial officers in district and subordinate courts was 22,644. The number of judicial officers in position and vacant posts is 17,509 and 5,135, respectively. The government has proposed that while states and high courts can recruit judicial officers, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) can hold pan-India entrance tests. The ministry has made it clear that such services would not encroach on the powers of the states. As of now, the selection and appointment of judges in subordinate courts is the responsibility of the high courts and state governments concerned. The Narendra Modi government has given a fresh push to the long-pending proposal to set up the new service to have a separate cadre for lower judiciary in the country. But there is a divergence of opinion among state governments and respective high courts on constitution of the All India Judicial Service (AIJS). One of the problems cited is that since several states have used powers under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) to declare that the local language would be used in lower courts even for writing orders, a person say selected from Tamil Nadu may find it difficult to hold proceedings in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The other point of opposition is that an all India service may hamper the career progression of state judicial services officers. Another key issue the ministry has to handle in 2020 is vacancies in the 25 high courts. Throughout 2019, on an average, the high courts faced a shortage of 400 judges. According to Law Ministry data, as on September 1, the high courts had 414 vacant positions as compared to the sanctioned strength of 1,079 judges. The figure was 409 in August and 403 in July, as per the data. A three-member Supreme Court collegium recommends names of candidates for appointment as high court judges. In case of appointments to the Supreme Court, the collegium consists of five top judges of the top court. High court collegiums shortlist candidates for their respective high courts and send the names to the law ministry. The ministry, along with background check reports by the Intelligence Bureau, forwards it to the Supreme Court collegium for a final call. The government has maintained that appointment of judges in the high courts is a ""continuous collaborative process"" between the Executive and the Judiciary, as it requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional authorities. Vacancies keep arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of judges and increase in judges' strength. In June last year, the vacancy position stood at 399, while it was 396 in May. In April, 399 posts of judges were vacant, while the figure was 394 in March. The vacancy position in February stood at 400 and in January, it was 392, according to the data collated by the Department of Justice. Over 43 lakh cases are pending in the 25 high courts. Another priority would be the finalisation of memorandum of procedure to guide appointment and transfer of Supreme Court and high court judges. The issue had now been pending for over two years now with the SC collegium and the government failing to reach a consensus. Successive governments have also been working on making India a hub of international arbitration. It has taken several steps to change laws dealing with commercial disputes.

Modi Government in 2019: Key decisions taken by the Narendra Modi government in 2019 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In 2019, the BJP-led NDA government came to power with a resounding victory. In the runup to the Lok Sabha elections and following its decisive mandate, the Narendra Modi government has taken several deicsion which hogged the national news headlines this year. Here is a look at some of these decisions taken by the government — 1. Balakot airstrikesOn February 26, a vehicle-borne suicide bomber carried out a ghastly attack on a CRPF convoy on its way from Jammu to Srinagar leading to the death of 40 paramilitary personnel. The attack, the deadliest on Indian security forces since 1989, was carried out by Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. A week later, on February 26, India retaliated by launching pre-dawn airstrikes destroying terror camps in Balakot, Pakistan, killing a large number of terrorists. Within hours, the Pakistan Air Force responded and in the ensuing dogfight, IAF lost a MiG-21 fighter leading to the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman by the Pakistan forces. After 60 hours in captivity, Varthaman was released by Pakistan. The tensions between the two countries prevailed for several months. 2. Reservation for economically weaker sectionsAhead of 17th Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought the 124th Constitution Amendment Bill, 2019, which provided 10 per cent reservation to people from economically weaker sections (EWS) in government jobs and educational institutes. The amendment allowed those in the general category with an annual income of up to Rs 8 lakh to seek a reservation in government jobs and education. 3. Instant Triple Talaq becomes a criminal offenceThe Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 was given the presidential assent in July 2019 amidst objections from the Muslim community. In December 2017, the Supreme Court had declared instant triple talaq unconstitutional. Drawing upon Supreme Court's verdict, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill was tabled in the parliament in 2017 but it failed to pass in both the houses. However, in July 2019, the Bill was passed in both the houses and the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, made instant triple talaq by Muslim men a criminal offence punishable by a jail term of up to three years. 4. Jammu & Kashmir loses special statusThe Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government in August announced the scrapping of Article 370 which gave special status to the state. In addition to scrapping to Article 370, the government also announced to split the state into two union territories— one was J&K with a legislature and second was Ladakh without a legislature. Abrogation of Article 370 was heavily condemned by various stakeholders in the country as well as witnessed scepticism from the international community. The abrogation was followed by a massive clampdown in the Valley, which included a heavy deployment of security forces, arrest of political leaders, including former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, and snapping of internet connections and phones lines. 5. CAA/NRCAfter a heated debate in Parliament, the Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed leading to country-wide protests. The controversial Act grants citizenship status to religious minorities, barring the Muslims, persecuted in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The passage of the Bill led to widespread protest across the country. In several places, the protests turned violent leading to loss of life and property. Opposition parties accused the government of trying to divide the country on communal lines with the introduction of the Act. The government refuted the allegations, claiming that the Act grants refuge to persecuted minorities in neighbouring countries. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Govt bats to retain Parsi jury system to protect customs | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: After enacting a law to make triple talaq a punishable offence, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that jury system to adjudicate matrimonial disputes, including divorce and child custody, through a jury system needed to be retained for the Parsi community. In response to a Parsi woman’s petition challenging several provisions of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936, the Centre opposed the petitioner’s claim for parity in the legal system between Hindus and Parsis in matters relating to matrimonial disputes, including divorce. Petitioner Naomi Sam Irani, through advocate Neela Gokhale, had said the 1936 Act was exasperatingly cumbersome, involving a system akin to jury decision and granted no access to mediation and settlement available to Hindu women under the family court system. The Centre’s affidavit said the 1936 Act was a pre-constitutional legislation and was considered to conform with the customs of the Parsi community. “When initiatives came from the board of trustees of Parsi Panchayat, Bombay, in 1986 in the form of proposals to amend the Act, the Minorities Commission had considered the said proposals and recommended the same to the government. Amendments were carried out in 1988 to make certain provisions of PMD Act similar to Hindu Marriage Act,” it said. However, the Centre did not support Irani’s plea for divorce proceedings in family courts as was available to Hindus. “Parsi community is a special community forming part of Indian societal mosaic and it was felt necessary to protect their values, customs, beliefs and practices in the field of personal law. Parsi community, owing to their scarce numbers, also requires to be protected by way of separate mechanism. A special law (like PMD Act) for that small community, with an intelligibly different or unique structure, is permissible in law,” it said. Irani had moved a Parsi matrimonial suit in 2016 before the Bombay high court seeking dissolution of her 11-year-old marriage, from which the couple has a 10-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter. Section 18 of PMD Act provides for constitution of special courts in Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai where the chief justice of the HC concerned would have jurisdiction to appoint a judge who would be aided by five delegates, who together would decide alimony, maintenance as well as custody and maintenance for children and their education.

Opposition flays police action on Jamia students | Patna News - Times of India,"PATNA: Political parties in Bihar had a mixed response to the Delhi Police action against Jamia Millia Islamia University students, who were protesting against the new citizenship law on Sunday.

Giriraj told reporters: “The protesters in Jamia university or Kerala or Patna are those who already had aches because of several other reasons. They are those people, who had problem with the law to criminalize instant triple talaq, amendment to Article 370 and 35 (A)…They are, in fact, those people who celebrate victory of Pakistan in a cricket match with India.” Speaking on the issue, former Madhepura MP and Jan Adhikaar Party chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav said this (NDA) government has no other option left than using baton against students. “The country is run as per the Constitution and not as per the agenda of any political party.

This government is now attacking students in utter frustration as they are unable to stop the voices of protest across the country,” he said. RJD also condemned the police action on Jamia students. “It was evident that the police hand-picked students at Jamia university and thrashed them. The prevailing situation is really bad as the entire country is witnessing violent protests against the policies of Narendra Modi government and they will not be pardoned for their attempts of dividing the country,” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said.

" SC to hear pleas against polygamy, nikah halala among Muslims after winter break | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Monday said it will hear after the winter break the pleas challenging practices of polygamy and 'nikah halala' among Muslims. The issue was mentioned before a bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant which said the matter cannot be heard immediately and will be listed on reopening of the apex court after winter break in January 2019. The plea was mentioned by advocate and BJP politician Ashwini Upadhyay, who has sought a direction to declare polygamy and 'nikah halala' among Muslims as unconstitutional and illegal. The apex court in July 2018 had considered the plea and it referred the matter to a Constitution bench that has been already asked to hear a batch of similar petitions. The apex court had issued notice to the Centre on the petition filed by one Farjana and tagged Upadhyay's plea along with a batch of petitions to be heard by the constitution bench. ""Petitioner is filing this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus to declare polygamy and nikah halala, practised in Muslim community, illegal and unconstitutional for being violative of Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 of the Constitution,"" the plea said. The petition by the lawyer further sought a declaration that extra-judicial talaq is a cruelty under Section 498A of the IPC, nikah halala is an offence under Section 375 of the IPC, and polygamy is an offence under Section 494 of the IPC, 1860. The apex court, which on August 22, 2017, had banned the age-old practice of instant 'triple talaq' among Sunni Muslims, had on March 26, 2018 decided to refer to a larger bench a batch of pleas challenging the constitutional validity of polygamy and 'nikah halala' among Muslims. While polygamy allows a Muslim man to have four wives, 'nikah halala' is a process in which a Muslim woman, who wants to re-marry her husband after divorce, has to first marry another person and get a divorce from the second person after consummating the marriage. The pleas were referred to a larger bench by the Supreme Court after an earlier five-judge constitution bench, in its 2017 verdict, had kept open the issue of polygamy and 'nikah halala', while quashing the practice of 'triple talaq'. It had also issued notices to the Law and Justice Ministry, the Minority Affairs Ministry and the National Commission of Women (NCW) at that time. Some petitions have also challenged the practices of 'Nikah Mutah' and 'Nikah Misyar' -- two types of temporary marriages where duration of the relationship is specified and agreed upon in advance. In one of the petitions, one Sameena Begum has said that by virtue of Muslim Personal Law and Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code (marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife) was rendered inapplicable to Muslims and no married woman from the community has the avenue of filing a complaint against her husband for the offence of bigamy. Another plea was filed by one Rani alias Sabnam who alleged that she and her three minor kids have been thrown out of the matrimonial home after her husband re-married. She has sought that the practices of polygamy and 'nikah halala' among Muslims be declared unconstitutional. A similar plea was filed by Delhi-based Nafisa Khan seeking almost same reliefs. She has sought to declare the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, as unconstitutional and violative of Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) of the Constitution in so far as it fails to secure for Indian Muslim women the protection from bigamy which has been statutorily secured for women in India belonging to other religions. The top court had also allowed Muslim Women Resistance Committee, Kolkata to file an application for impleadment as a party in the hearing.

In a democracy, fighting an election is my way of countering and fighting extremism."" The AIMIM chief further said, “What she is doing is nothing sort of soft Hindutva and dog whistle politics.

Earlier in the day, Owaisi had said on Twitter, “Power has made Mamata Banerjee and her party TMC arrogant. Despite Muslims voting for TMC, BJP won 18 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal.

Perhaps, she should do an introspection.” He went on to add, “It’s not religious extremism to say that Bengal’s Muslims have one of the worst human development indicators of any minority. If Didi is worried about a bunch of us ‘from Hyderabad’, then she should tell us how BJP won 18/42 LS seats from Bengal.” In another tweet, he said, “What is extremism?

The PM praised NCP and BJD for deciding to stay away from the well of the House. Calling the Upper House ""eternal"", Prime Minister Modi stressed the significance of the House. From mentioning abrogation of Article 370 to triple talaq Bill, Modi highlighted how ""historic"" the House has been. Praising the Rajya Sabha, he said it was the House's maturity that ensured the Bill on Triple Talaq and the one on GST were passed, in spite of opposition to it. Mentioning abrogation of Article 370, Modi said, ""Whenever it has been about national good, the Rajya Sabha has risen to the occasion and made a strong contribution. ""We can never forget the role of the Rajya Sabha when Bills pertaining to Articles 370 and 35(A) were passed. This House has worked to further the unity of the counrty."" Taking a subtle dig at opposition, he said, ""It was believed that the Bill on Triple Talaq would not pass here, but it did.""

PM Modi called the Rajya Sabha as the ""supporting house"", stressing the important role it plays to keep ""checks and balances"". Taking about cooperative Centre-state relationship, he saisd, ""Our Constitution inspires us to work for a welfare state. It also motivates us to work for the welfare of states. The Rajya Sabha, as the Council of States, enables us to further the spirit of cooperative federalism.""

They have made their points very effectively. Much can be learned from these practices.""

 Ayodhya verdict: Justice Nazeer most sought judge in matters of religion in SC | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Justice S Abdul Nazeer, the lone Muslim judge in the five-member Constitution bench of the Supreme Court, which on Saturday delivered a historic verdict in the Ayodhya land dispute case, has been one of the most sought after judges in matters involving religion. Justice Nazeer was also the part of the five-judge bench in the 'triple talaq' matter but had delivered a minority verdict along with then Chief Justice of India J S Khehar. By the 3:2 verdict, the apex court had held issue of 1,400-year-old practice of 'triple talaq' among Muslims as illegal and unconstitutional. However, in the Ayodhya verdict, the judge, who was elevated to the apex court from the Karnataka high court, did not agree with the arguments of the Muslim parties and became a part of the unanimous verdict that possession of the disputed 2.77-acre land rights will be handed over to the deity Ram Lalla. Before becoming a part of the Constitution bench in the Ayodhya case, Justice Nazeer was part of a three-judge bench, including the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra and Ashok Bhushan, which by 2:1 majority had declined to set up a larger bench for a relook of its 1994 verdict which had held that a ""mosque is not an essential part of the practice of Islam"". The September 27, 2018 verdict by the three-judge bench had paved the way for the apex court to hear the Ayodhya land dispute case in which Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi constituted a five-judge bench to adjudicate the issue. In the original scheme of the five-judges to hear the Ayodhya dispute, Justice Nazeer along with Justice Bhushan was not named to hear the matter. But the recusal of two judges - Justice N V Ramana and U U Lalit brought into the fold to hear the politically and religiously sensitive temple-mosque land dispute at Ayodhya. Besides these cases, Justice Nazeer was also a part of the Supreme Court's nine-judge bench which had declared 'right to privacy' as a fundamental right in the August 2017 verdict Justice Nazeer, 61, who was enrolled as an advocate in 1983 and had practiced in the Karnataka high court was appointed as an additional judge of the Karnataka high court on May 12, 2003 and was made a permanent judge there in September 2004.

Secunderabad: Man gives triple talaq over crooked teeth | Hyderabad News - Times of India,"SECUNDERABAD: A 36-year-old man from Secunderabad gave triple talaq to his wife last month allegedly for her crooked teeth. A case has been registered under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act but the man and his family members are on the run. Mohammed Mustafa, an auto driver, married Rukhsana (25) on June 27 this year. On October 1, he gave instant talaq to her. The crime came to light on Friday after the Rukhsana Begum’s family made it public. A week after the wedding, Mustafa and his family allegedly started harassing her mentally and physically for more dowry, Rukhsana’s family alleged. “Mustafa told my sister that he doesn’t like her because of her crooked teeth and doesn’t want to continue the marriage. But we think it has more to do with the dowry,” said her brother Khaleel Shaikh. Mustafa had also lied about his profession to Rukhsana’s family before their wedding , Khaleel said. ""They came to our house in cars and said that he owned a shop. We spent around ₹12 lakh on the wedding and gave five tolas of gold and ₹5 lakh cash. Only after the marriage, did we find out that he was an auto driver. Still, we accepted the fact,"" said Khaleel Rukhsana’s in-laws had even allegedly locked her up inside the bedroom for 15 days and she fell ill because of the torture. “We took her to the hospital and then home, but she did not utter a word about the harassment thinking about the debts we had taken for her marriage. But they (in-laws) didn’t come to pick her up and even blocked all our phone numbers,” Khaleel said. Rukhsana initially approached the Malkajgiri police station, where the couple was counselled. “My sister was disheartened that he didn’t say anything about her teeth during the engagement and suddenly Mustafa doesn’t want to be with her after the marriage because of her teeth. After counselling, he said that he will come to pick her up on October 3,” said Khaleel. “While she was staying with her parents in Moula Ali area, the accused visited her on October 1 at around 12.30pm and divorced her,” said SI (Kushaiguda) G Girish Kumar. The family tried to make amends with the groom’s family but failed.

"Law on triple talaq ended maulanakaran of politics, says Yogi Adityanath | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said the law banning instant triple talaq has ended ‘maulanakaran’ of politics in the country. “Triple talaq kanoon ne rajneeti ka maulanakaran band kiya hai,” he said while campaigning for BJP’s Lucknow Cantt candidate Suresh Tewari. Yogi, who returned to UP after campaigning in Maharashtra and Harayana, addressed back-to-back rallies in Lucknow, Kanpur, Chitrakoot and Pratapgarh on Tuesday. Stating that the country would be governed by the Constitution and not fatwas, he said it was only after 70 years that Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir was abrogated and law was brought against triple talaq by the BJP regime. “BJP does not do politics of appeasement of certain caste and religion,” the CM said, exhorting party supporters to take the message to each household. He said even BR Ambedkar was against Article 370. “People doing politics in the name of Ambedkar should understand that there cannot be two laws within one country,” Yogi said in an apparent swipe at Opposition parties. Terming Lucknow as the city of Laxman (the younger brother of Lord Ram), Yogi said the city has been the karmbhoomi of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and now defence minister Rajnath Singh. He said the people of Lucknow have sent a large number of BJP leaders not only to the Lok Sabha but also to UP assembly, municipal corporations and local bodies. “BJP is a party of workers and is not restricted to one family,” the CM said amid loud cheers of ‘Jai Sri Ram’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ by BJP functionaries. In Pratapgarh, the CM categorically tore into Congress accusing it of opposing Article 370 which was a ‘blot on Kashmir’. He also lashed out at SP and BSP for promoting nepotism and casteism, the repercussions of which are being faced by the people of the state. “Development and good governance is not on the agenda of these parties. One should not expect development measures from them,” he underlined. Addressing a rally in Chitrakoot, Yogi said that tanks manufactured in the defence corridor will have Chitrakoot inscribed on them. “This is a holy land where Lord Ram spent his time in exile. But for the past 15 years, SP, BSP and Congress, in connivance with contractors, looted funds meant for the development of the region,” he alleged.

The PM Modi on Sunday, while addressing rally in Jalgaon had accused the opposition of trying to block the triple talaq law saying the opposition parties led by Congress tried to create hurdles to prevent passage of triple talaq because they did not want Muslim women to benefit. If they have guts, let them publicly announce that they will do away with this law if they come to power.

"Narendra Modi says soldiers lost lives because of Cong's 'love' for Article 370, asserts country has backed his decision | India News - Times of India","BALLABGARH (HARYANA): Launching a broadside against the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked the opposition party to explain ""its love"" for Article 370 to the families of security personnel martyred in Jammu and Kashmir. Addressing his first of four election rallies in Haryana this week, he said the opposition was shedding ""crocodile tears"" and challenged the Congress to tell people that it will rescind the Modi government's decision on J-K if voted to power. Modi also targeted the Congress over Rafale, saying he was happy that despite its best efforts to stall the deal, the country had received first of the fighter jets, and stressed that the BJP was committed to strengthening security forces. After it swept the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP has again made nationalism its major poll plank in upcoming assembly elections, which will be the first in the country after the Centre's decision to scrap special status to J-K on August 5. Asserting that India is now taking big decisions like on Article 370 which were unthinkable earlier, the Prime Minister said the massive mandate from the people gave him the strength to take the step which, he asserted, has the backing of the entire country including Haryana. Some people whose interests have been affected are raising questions on this decision and seeking help in foreign nations, the Prime Minister said, while again targeting the opposition on the issue as he did in poll-bound Maharashtra on Sunday. Modi said the opposition parties in Haryana were crumbling and their attempts to come together are falling apart, while the BJP had a ""strong team and a strong captain"" in chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. ""India is taking big decisions, which no one could think of earlier. Which decision am I talking about? This decision on Article 370,"" he said. Modi said there was feeling in Haryana and the entire country that J&K needs to be pulled out of spiral of violence and put on path of development. ""J&K and Ladakh are moving on path of trust and development and credit for this does not go to Modi, but it goes to 130 crore people of this country and voters of this country. You gave us big mandate and I derive strength from you to realise your dreams,"" he said. Modi accused the opposition parties of politicising the issue of Article 370.""The entire country is also seeing people whose interests have been affected by the decision on Article 370 are in a state of shock. These people are raising questions on this decision and seeking help in foreign nations."" ""Those who are unable to sleep and 'j in ke pet mein chuhey daud rahe hain', if these people have so much liking for Article 370 and 35-A, then I challenge them why don't they muster courage and go before people of Haryana and tell them that if they win elections, they will bring back Article 370 and 35-A,"" Modi said. On Sunday, Khattar too had used a Hindi proverb "" khoda pahad nikli chuhiya"" to take a swipe at the Congress' three-month effort at choosing a president, drawing ire of the opposition party. The proverb suggests there was much ado about noting. Though literally, it means finding a mouse after digging a mountain. He said those opposing the decision know that Modi government got overwhelming public mandate and support because of which the Centre was able to take a decision on Article 370. He asked people to go to villages and make people understand the benefits of the step. Training guns on opposition, he said ""because of their love for Article 370 mothers lost their brave sons and young women were widowed"". ""The brave jawan of Haryana who was protecting innocent citizens of J&K, who fell to bullet of terrorists and when his body came back wrapped in tricolour, ask those mothers how many sons-of-soil lost lives because of your love for Article 370... ask how many were widowed and how many children were orphaned,"" he said at the rally in the state which sends a large numbers of youths in security forces. ""Those who lost their dear ones for peace in J&K, Congress leaders must tell them why they love Article 370 so much. They must tell in what way this Article benefited the state,"" he said Taking a dig at Congress, Modi said, it should ""tell people that it will reverse what Modi has done. And when Lok Sabha elections come, mention in manifesto that they will reverse these decisions. Do they have the courage to say so?"" He said the Dalit community in Jammu and Kashmir was deprived of decent jobs there. He said that wards of people belonging to 'Valmiki' community were never considered capable of other jobs than sweeping and toilet cleaning for four generations. Modi also accused the Congress of doing votebank politics over triple talaq issue, alleging the opposition parties made every kind of excuse to stall the law against triple talaq. ""Congress and other parties like them stood like a wall in the way of each betterment and change you have seen,"" Modi alleged. A day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi again rake up the Rafale deal issue, the Prime Minister alleged that the opposition made their best efforts to ensure the agreement for fighter jets was cancelled. You remember, during Lok Sabha polls, how they made a hue and cry over the Rafale deal. They were beating their chests and made their best efforts to ensure that the agreement for Rafale was cancelled, he said. Modi said that he was happy that India had got its first Rafale aircraft. He said that it was not acceptable to him that country's soldiers become victims of the enemy in the absence of necessary arms and ammunition. Modi accused the previous Congress government of putting Tejas project, the home-built jet, on the back burner. ""Don't know (it was done) under whose pressure. Our government has removed all the bottlenecks and gave wings to this project,"" he said. He said undertaking development and bringing change in people's lives has always been his priority. Modi praised Khattar, saying his team has taken Haryana to new heights of development. He said the more the opposition parties are trying to come together, the more they are falling apart. Modi began his address by saying the place is not far from here where during Emergency days former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was arrested and put behind bars for 19 months. Seeking to strike an emotional chord, he said, ""When I am amongst you, when I come to Haryana, I always feel like I am coming to my home. Haryana taught me a lot...""

Addressing a rally at Jalgaon in north Maharashtra, Modi put J&K and Ladakh at the heart of his speech to articulate how NDA was going full steam ahead with ""extraordinary"" decisions while the opposition was just being a stumbling block.

""But they will not do so, as they know that the people of the country have hailed our decision and will not spare anyone who tries to bring back Article 370. The opposition must stop shedding crocodile tears on this,"" he said.  The PM also accused the opposition of trying to block the triple talaq law.

If they have the guts, let them publicly announce that they will do away with this law if they come to power.

On the Congress-NCP alliance, Modi said the two were a ""tired lot"". ""They have come together, but they are incapable of fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Maharashtra."" At Sakoli in Bhandara, his second rally of the day, the PM urged people of the state to ensure a ""historic mandate"" for the BJP-Shiv Sena combine.  Unlike in Jalgaon, he didn't mention J&K once. He had started his speech in Marathi, saying, ""I thank the people of Maharashtra for their support in the LS polls. I had addressed a public meeting in Gondia before that election.

But dialogue didn’t yield result,” the resolution stated. With legal proceedings in final stage, the mediation window is closed, the board said.

" India, J&amp;K people happy with scrapping of special status: JP Nadda | India News - Times of India","KURUKSHETRA: BJP working president J P Nadda on Monday claimed that the entire country were happy with the scrapping of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Even people of Jammu and Kashmir are happy with the decision, he claimed. ""India is happy. People of J&K are happy too as they have got an opportunity to join the mainstream,"" he said, adding that the decision was in the interest of the newly carved union territory. Now 104 laws passed by Parliament would be applicable to J&K, he said hailing the ""will power"" and ""tactics"" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, respectively, for the decision. Nadda claimed that earlier women marrying those from outside the state were deprived of their property rights, which was discriminatory. Interacting with party workers here ahead of the assembly polls, Nadda said a delimitation exercise would be carried out in Jammu and Kashmir and reservation would be provided to the SCs/STs. In an apparent reference to the Gandhis, Muftis and Abdullahs, he said ""three political families"" kept Gujjars and Bakrawals backward. Terming the legislation on triple talaq a key decision by the Union government, the BJP leader hit out at the Congress, saying they always indulged in ""vote bank"" politics. He also urged party workers to go door-to-door to apprise people about achievements of the Centre as well as the state government.

""Look at others, either their leader is in jail or on bail,"" he said targeting the opposition. He also praised the initiatives taken by the Khattar government for the welfare of people. He told the workers that they should consider themselves fortunate for being members of the party whose membership has risen to 17 crore. ""Out of 193 nations, only seven, including India, have population in excess of 17 crore,"" he said. Nadda made a mention of a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong in New Delhi last week. The BJP leader said he told the Chinese envoy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ""changed the narrative of politics in the country"". ""Modiji and his government's programmes are for the benefit of the last man standing in the queue,"" he claimed of telling the envoy. During his address, chief minister Khattar stressed that winnability and dedication towards the party would be the key criteria in selecting candidates for the upcoming polls. He tried to reach out to those in the race for the party ticket, saying there may be more than one deserving candidate for a constituency and unsuccessful candidates should not feel disappointed. They should instead work to ensure the victory of the candidates named by the party, he said. He also asked the workers to counter the opposition propaganda while stating about a recent incident during his 'Jan Ashirwad Yatra', in which he was heard telling a worker that ""he will chop off his head"". About the incident, Khattar said he felt ""remorse"" as getting angry was not a good thing. He said it made him think that the BJP had changed the political culture. ""Our role is not that of a raja or maharaja, but of a self-respecting sevak,"" he said. Nadda is scheduled to interact with party workers in Rohtak, Sonipat and Jhajjar on Tuesday.

" BJP MPs head most panels, outnumber opposition in committees | India News - Times of India","(This story originally appeared in  on Sep 16, 2019)NEW DELHI: The constitution of the much-awaited Department-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) gives little hope to the opposition in holding the government accountable in the forthcoming sessions as most of the important panels will be headed by BJP MPs and the ruling party members will be in majority in all of the 24 DRSCs. In the last Parliament session, the opposition alleged that the government was passing crucial bills without scrutiny by the standing or select committees. Bills seeking to ban instant triple talaq, amend Motor Vehicles Act, Aadhaar Act and the Indian Medical Council Act were passed after just a day’s discussion. A close look at the composition of the new DRSCs shows the opposition will not have much say. Called “mini-Parliament”, these committees are formed keeping the strength of various parties in mind. With BJP having a brute majority — 303 seats out of 545 in Lok Sabha — it will easily outnumber the opposition in every committee. Each of the 24 committees will have 21 members from the Lower House and 10 from the Upper House. In the Rajya Sabha too, BJP is comfortably placed with 78 members in a house of 245. Defections, resignations and re-election (in some cases) on BJP tickets of some opposition members from various parties have further weakened the ruling party’s opponents. In the 16th Lok Sabha, the Modi government often rued that important bills were getting stuck in the Rajya Sabha or were indefinitely delayed by standing or select committees of the Upper House. Chairpersonship of the Standing Committee on Home Affairs is the only significant panel that Congress gets to head this time, with party’s Anand Sharma replacing P Chidambaram. Congress MP Jairam Ramesh as head of the science, technology, environment and forest panel would be active as he knows the subject well. Same goes for his party colleague Shashi Tharoor who will now head the information technology committee. External affairs committee, much like the Public Accounts Committee, is conventionally headed by an MP from the main opposition. But Tharoor has been moved out and replaced by PP Chaudhary, who is a law expert. Similarly, the key finance standing committee will now be headed by BJP’s Jayant Sinha. Veteran Congress MP M Veerappa Moily chaired this panel and an MP from the opposition would have made the going tough for the government at a time when it is battling slowdown. Too much is being made of Rahul Gandhi being moved from home to defence. But he was never very active in the committee meetings. Trinamool has come out a loser in the new committees. Sudip Bandopadhyay headed the railways standing committee but it will now be chaired by BJP’s Radha Mohan Singh. BJP has also taken away transport, tourism and culture committee from Trinamool, with TG Venkatesh, who till a few months back was with TDP before switching over to BJP, replacing Derek O’Brien. Current Status of Mini-ParliamentThere are 24 Department-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) — 16 from Lok Sabha and 8 from Rajya Sabha. Each committee will have 21 MPs from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha. In Rajya Sabha, opposition parties will head five of the eight DRSCs. Earlier, BJP headed four but this time it would head only three.

" Scraping 370, criminalising triple talaq government's major achievements in 100 days: Prakash Javadekar | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, criminalisation of instant triple talaq and amendment in a law to allow an individual to be designated as 'terrorist' were some of the major decisions taken by the Modi government in its first 100 days, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said on Sunday. As the government completed 100 days in office in its second consecutive term, the minister also allayed fears of a slowdown, saying the fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong and there is no ""panic situation"" in the country. He said that sometimes slowdown is a ""cyclical process"" and such a patch will not hurt the country's progress. While Javadekar addressed a press conference here and released a booklet on the government's achievements, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about his government's works at a rally in Haryana's Rohtak. Modi said ""development, trust and big changes in the country"" have marked the 100 days of his government. ""We know how to take challenges head-on"". Modi said that 130 crore Indians were the inspiration behind the government's major decisions in various fields from farm sector to national security.

When asked about the criticism, Javadekar hit out at Rahul Gandhi, saying ""those who are not to be seen in 90 out of 100 days, how can I react on their comment."" He said the world knows whether the government worked. The prime minister's Independence Day speech, his speech to the Motion of Thanks to the President's Address in Parliament, laws which have been passed, the way things have changed and decisions implemented show the government's positive intent. ""This speed, the Congress had never witnessed. Therefore, I don't have anything to say on their comment,"" Javadekar said. According to the document released, the move to scrap special status to Jammu and Kashmir accorded under Article 370 of the Constitution will bring the state at par with other states. The world community has supported New Delhi's move at various international fora, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting said. ""Pakistan knocked several doors including the UN...but the world stood by India ... it is the biggest achievement,"" the minister said. Javadekar said that barring one minor terror incident, there has been no casualties such as deaths from police firing or teargas shells in the last 35 days in J&K. ""Since the 1990s, when terrorism began (in Jammu and Kashmir) this is the first such instance for 35 days"" when no casualties have been reported, he said. Prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC are in force in 14 police stations, ""otherwise there is no restriction."" He said some ""foreign news agencies"" had shown demonstrations held elsewhere or which were four-year-old and passed them off as protests in J&K. Through Doordarshan, he said the government is countering ""fake news"" by showing the reality in Jammu and Kashmir. The booklet said that after the JK's special status was withdrawn ""laws pertaining to education, empowerment of SCs and STs, minorities and others to be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir ... provisions of 10 per cent quota for economically weaker sections of the society to apply."" ""Perhaps no other government in the past has taken so many people-friendly decisions in its first 100 days in power,"" Javadekar said. The minister said that the decisions taken by the government in its first 100 days have helped empower people and brought in more inclusiveness and transparency. These decisions could be taken in quick time as preparations for them had started even before the Lok Sabha elections, he said. He also lauded the sensitivity Prime Minister Modi exhibited towards space scientists on Saturday after the ISRO centre lost communication with Chandrayaan-2 lander 'Vikram' when it was about to touch down on the lunar surface. Javadekar said the government has also unveiled a roadmap to make India a USD-5 trillion economy by 2024. Responding to questions on economy, slowdown and unemployment, he said ""world over, there is a slowdown which also impacts markets here and people's behaviour changes"". ""Therefore, we should not be worried too much. The government is responding with whatever actions are immediately necessary. This is a temporary phase and not a direction of a real slowdown, he said."" He said sometimes there is a ""patch where you get a cyclical slowdown"".

Banka man booked for divorcing wife through triple talaq | Patna News - Times of India,"BANKA: A Banka woman, Bibi Ayesha, was in for a shock when her husband, Md Iftequar, gave her instant triple talaq by pronouncing ‘talaq, talaq, talaq’ over cellphone from Delhi on August 29. The matter came to light on Sunday after the police registered an FIR against Iftequar in accordance with the provisions of new legislation — The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act of 2019 — which aims to protect the rights of married Muslim women and prohibits divorce by pronouncing instant ‘triple talaq’. “Section-III of the Act makes triple talaq illegal, whereas Section-IV clearly refers to imprisonment up to three years and penalty. Besides, the offence is cognizable and non-bailable as per Section-VII of the Act,” Banka SDPO Dinesh Chandra Shrivastava said. “We are taking appropriate action against Iftequar and his family based on the allegations levelled by the victim,” the SDPO added. Apart from approaching the Panjwara police to seek justice, Ayesha also intends to knock PM Narendra Modi’s door to draw his attention towards her plight. Daughter of one Halim Ansari, a resident of Nawadih village under the Saraiyahat police station area in Jharkhand’s Dumka district, Ayesha had married Iftequar in 2013. Initially, everything was smooth for the couple, but things started to turn sour after Iftequar shifted to Delhi to earn his livelihood. Recently, as marital discord further heightened between the couple, a village panchayat was organised by the family members of the bride for reconciliation. But the groom (who was in the village for Bakrid) and his family members were not ready for any reconciliation, sources said. Iftequar, a tailor, then returned to Delhi and gave instant triple talaq to Ayesha on August 29. Ayesha has also accused Iftequar and his family members of subjecting her to physical and mental torture for dowry, sources said. SHO of Panjwara police station Murlidhar Shah said a written complaint has been received and the matter is being investigated as per the legal provisions.

" Can woman claim residential right at in-laws house? SC to examine, seeks Centre response | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to examine whether a woman deserted by her husband could claim residential right in her in-laws’ house where she had been living after marriage? A bench of Justices N V Ramana, M M Shantanagoudar and Ajay Rastogi issued notice to the Centre asking whether residential right could be given to a woman under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act on a plea filed by a Muslim woman who alleged that her husband her deserted her in 2004 and her in-laws threw her out of her matrimonial house. Petitioner Shabnam Ahmed, a mother of three, claimed that her husband went to the UK 15 years ago and did not come back. She claimed that her husband divorced her illegally by pronouncing triple talaq in 2007 on phone and her in-laws threw her out along with her daughter. Her two other children are still living with her in-laws. Shabnam, 40, had first approached the trail court seeking residential right in the house but her plea was dismissed in 2018 and she approached the apex court directly against the trial court order. Justifying filing the petition in the SC instead of moving an appeal in the high court, senior advocate R B Singhal and lawyer Nilofar Khan told the bench that Shabnam’s plea for residential right was rejected by the trial court by relying on an SC judgment of 2007. They urged the court to re-examine the verdict as the provision pertaining to residential right was narrowly interpreted and was affecting the rights of women in matrimonial disputes. In 2007, the SC had said the wife was not entitled to seek residential right if the house in which she lived with her husband belonged to the in-laws. Singhal told the court that there was difference of opinion among HCs on residential right claimed by the wife in a shared household belonging to the in-laws and requested the bench to adjudicate the issue to end the contradictions. He said the 2007 verdict was against the spirit and objective of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The petitioner claimed that she was forced to live hand-to-mouth after being thrown out of her matrimonial house and was surviving on the support of her friends, including her lawyer, as her parents were no more. She said her husband had remarried and her in-laws cut off ties with her and refused to provide any help on the ground that they had disowned their son. She said she was forced to take legal recourse in 2013 after her parents died as she had no place to live. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Muslim women’s body seeks family law | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Aug 27, 2019)NEW DELHI: A Mumbai-based Muslim women’s body has urged the government to bring in a Muslim family law to “uphold gender justice and gender equality” for women in the community and also take measures to effectively implement the law that made triple talaq a criminal offence. The Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), which made the demand, was one of the co-petitioners with Shayara Bano against triple talaq in the Supreme Court, which in 2017 declared the practice unconstitutional. In a letter sent to Union law and justice minister Ravi Shankar Prasad last week, the women's organisation said even as the campaign against the abolition of triple talaq was successful with the passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, issues such as polygamy, halala and age of marriage still remained “unsolved”. ""We believe that the Parliament of India must pass a Muslim family law to uphold gender justice and gender equality for Muslim women,"" said the letter, a copy of which ET has seen.

The survey, she said, covered Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal, Karnataka, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha.

""To ensure that the Act is followed in letter and spirit and justice is given to Muslim women, we are examining as to why we should not arrest those involved in giving triple talaq. We will be doing that in some districts,"" Director General of Police OP Singh told PTI. He said very soon the police will also be going for ""impact analysis"" to ensure justice to Muslim women. ""Very soon, we will be calling a few sample cases to assess the impact to ensure justice to the victim women,"" he said. Some triple talaqs have been given over phone, through SMS or directly to women. In a case in Lucknow, a man allegedly gave triple talaq to his wife right inside civil court premises in the presence of her advocate after she refused to accept a chewing gum from him, police said. 30-year-old Simmi of Amrai village was divorced by her husband Syed Rashid where she had gone for the hearing of a case of dowry harassment she had lodged earlier against her in-laws. The woman was talking to her advocate when her husband offered her a chewing gum which she refused, throwing Rashid into a fit of rage so much so that he divorced his wife, uttering talaq three times then and there itself. In Banda, a woman was given triple talaq by her husband over phone, while in Barabanki a woman was given triple talaq through SMS. In another case, a man divorced his wife allegedly to escape from the responsibility of providing treatment to their physically challenged daughter. In a separate case, a woman alleged that her husband had ended their two-year-old marriage by pronouncing triple talaq over phone as she had a dark complexion. In yet another case, a man allegedly divorced his wife in full public view in her village market in Unnao district using the outlawed custom and mocking at the new law that declares the oral diktat a penal offence. The triple talaq law came into effect retrospectively from September 19, 2018, after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the legislation that makes giving instant oral triple talaq or talalq-e-biddat a criminal offence with provisions of jail term up to three years. The new law makes void and illegal talaq-e-biddat or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband. It also makes it illegal to pronounce talaq three times in spoken, written or through SMS or WhatsApp or any other electronic chat in one sitting. The law says any Muslim husband who pronounces the illegal form of talaq upon his wife shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine. The aggrieved woman is entitled to demand a maintenance from her husband for herself and her dependent children under the Act. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

"Meerut: Panchayat fixes Rs 20 lakh price for ‘talaq’ of two sisters, cops trash it | Meerut News - Times of India","MEERUT: A panchayat in Meerut has asked a family of two brothers to pay Rs 20 lakh as “settlement amount” to two girls, both sisters, whom they wanted to divorce, a decree trashed by local police which has decided to go ahead with its probe against alleged instant triple talaq given by one of them. The sisters Farzana, 22 and Shabana, 20 (names changed to protect identities) got married to brothers Rizwan and Mobeen two years ago. But, Mobeen and his wife Shabana were not getting along. Then, on August 18, Rizwan assaulted his wife Farzana and pronounced triple talaq on her. The girl’s mother was also thrashed by the brothers when she intervened. “Then Farzana lodged an FIR against Rizwan at local police station under the new triple talaq law,” a police officer said. After this, the family of brothers took the matter to the local panchayat. The panchayat announced that both the brothers divorce the sisters. It also fixed Rs 20 lakh cost (cost of marriages) to be paid by the boys’ family. Speaking to TOI, the brother of girls said, “It is true. We got the FIR registered. But, later elders of our community brought us on the negotiation table. They tried to explain to us that legal matters will only jeopardise my sisters’ future. They are in their early 20s and can be resettled. In addition, we have to get them married within our community so we cannot go against our elders in Panchayat also and above all, the opposite party is willing to pay marriage expenses also. We are ready to withdraw the case but police is not willing to listen to us.” However, police said that the order of the local panchayat has no validity and an FIR against triple talaq was already been probed. Dinesh Shukla, circle officer (CO) Kotwali said, “Panchayat’s decision has no legal standing and we do not acknowledge their intervention in the matter.

 SC agrees to examine triple talaq law | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the law to criminalise triple talaq but told the Deobandi clerics who have challenged its legality that practices followed in other faiths had also been made criminal offences. As senior advocate Salman Khurshid, appearing for the petitioners, argued that there was no need for the Centre to bring the law as triple talaq had ceased to exist after the apex court declared it illegal and unconstitutional, a bench of Justices N V Ramana and Ajay Rastogi asked what would happen if the practice was still followed despite it being declared illegal and what would be the remedy in that case. Referring to practices like child marriage and dowry, the bench told Khurshid that such practices too were criminalised. It said it would examine three aspects of the law — criminalising the practice, imprisonment and the provision that a woman has to be heard while granting bail to the accused. The court then issued notice to the Centre seeking its response on a batch of petitions filed against the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. One of the petitioners, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, contended that the legislation was discriminatory and inflicted disproportionate punishment for a civil wrong. It said the legislation passed by Parliament on July 31 was unnecessary as the SC had on August 22, 2017, declared the practice of instant divorce through triple talaq as unconstitutional. It termed Section 4 of the Act, prescribing punishment of up to three years’ imprisonment with fine, as an ill-conceived provision imposing excessive and discriminatory penalty on Muslim men resorting to triple talaq. “Lesser punishment is prescribed in Indian Penal Code for many offences which are far graver — rioting (two years), bribery (one year), food adulteration (six months), causing death due to rash and negligent driving (two years),” the petition said. Jamiat said under Hindu law, desertion by a spouse was not an offence but only a ground for divorce. Moreover, the new legislation made pronouncement of triple talaq a cognizable and non-bailable offence whereas causing death by rash and negligent driving was a bailable offence. “There are several more grave offences which are not punishable with such stringent punishment and are bailable. In fact, desertion of a wife by the husband under Hindu law is not even an offence. This clearly shows that the provisions, as far as it relates to criminality of pronouncement of triple talaq, are disproportionate and excessive... and deserves to be set aside as being violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution,” it said.

" Hate for BJP planted among minorities for 70 years, can't be wiped out in 70 days or 7 years: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Hate for the BJP has been planted in the minds of minorities for 70 years and it cannot be wiped out in 70 days or seven years, Union minister MukhtarAbbasNaqvi said Friday, asserting that the effect of this ""poison"" is now receding. Though the BJP was founded in 1980, its precursor Jan Sangh had been active since the 1950s. Naqvi asserted that minorities are feeling ""completely safe"" under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership as he has not indulged in any political exploitation of minorities for votes and has done development without discrimination. In an interview to PTI, the minority affairs minister said the prime minister's population control pitch cannot be looked through a religious prism and the government wanted to act on this through awareness and not by the ""Emergency-style"" control as done by the Congress. ""A growing economy can never ignore population explosion. Awareness is needed and society should be sensitised. Muslim community population has gone down. Those giving it communal angle have no knowledge,"" Naqvi said. ""There should be awareness (on population control). It should be carried out as a mission like the cleanliness drive for which no law was made,"" he said. On the acquittal of all accused in the Pehlu Khan lynching case in Rajasthan, Naqvi said law and order is a state subject and it is the responsibility of the state government to take action against perpetrators of such crime. ""Any crime that happens should be dealt with strongly...No crime should be looked upon from the communal angle,"" he said. Asked if Prime Minister Modi's popularity among minorities has gone up after the government's triple talaq law, Naqvi said the government's move on triple talaq, Article 370, demonetisation and GST, were reform measures and not intended for popularity. However, he said minorities have ""strong trust"" on Modi as they have realised that there are no riots and no atmosphere of discrimination under the his leadership. On why the BJP was still not electorally dominant in areas with a large number of people from minority communities, he said: ""In 70 years, hate has been planted in the minds (of minorities) for the BJP. This cannot be wiped out in 70 days or seven years. But, I am very much confident and satisfied that the effect of this poison on a large scale is receding."" Minorities are also realising that they are also benefiting from this atmosphere of inclusive development, he said, adding that there has been an increase in Modi's popularity among minorities. Naqvi also hit out at those contending that intolerance has been growing in the society, saying it was Modi who has been ""the biggest victim of political intolerance"" despite overwhelmingly winning people's confidence. Asked if the government will move forward on its poll promise of bringing in the Uniform Civil Code, he said there has been ""no discussion on this at any level"".

 Triple Talaq: SC issues notice to Centre on plea against new law; agrees to examine validity | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine the validity of a newly enacted law which makes the practice of instant divorce through triple talaq among Muslims a punishable offence entailing imprisonment of up to three years. A bench of justices N V Ramana and Ajay Rastogi issued notice to the Centre on a batch of petitions which has sought to declare The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 as ""unconstitutional"" on grounds that it allegedly violates the provisions of the Constitution. ""We will examine this,"" the bench told senior advocate Salman Khurshid, who was appearing for one of the petitioners. Khurshid told the bench that there were many dimensions, including making the practice a punishable offence and jail term of up to three years, which were required to be examined by the top court. Khurshid told the bench that the petitioners were concerned about making the practice of triple talaq among Muslims an offence as the apex court had already declared it to be null and void. ""If there is no such thing as triple talaq then what are they making an offence,"" he told the bench and referred to a five-judge constitution bench verdict which had declared the practice of triple talaq among Muslims as null and void. To this the bench asked, suppose if a religious practice is declared as null and void and it is declared as an offence like dowry and child marriages but if it still goes on then what is the remedy. Responding to the query, Khurshid said several aspects have to be examined and in the triple talaq matter the constitution bench had already said the practice is void. He said it has to be examined whether the religious practice denies the rights to the woman. The bench, while agreeing to examine the validity of the 2019 Act, observed that petitioners have also raised the issue of punishment of up to three years and grant of bail to the husband only after the woman is heard by the court. A total of four petitions have been filed in apex court challenging the validity of the law. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Instant talaq continues despite new law | India News - Times of India,"If you thought the passage of the triple talaq Bill, or Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, would prove to be a deterrent to this medieval practice of giving instant divorce, here’s a reality check. Ever since the Act got presidential assent on August 1 this year, instant talaq cases have been reported from several parts of the country with UP accounting for 21 cases, followed by Maharashtra (5), Uttarakhand (3), Odisha (3), Madhya Pradesh (3) Jharkhand (2), Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Kerala and Gujarat (one each). While most of these cases have been triggered by demand for dowry, a few have been the outcome of innocuous requests by the victims like money to buy medicine and a small gift on Eid. Interestingly, in many of these cases, the perpetrators have not been booked under the stringent triple talaq Act because “investigations are on” and as some of the states are yet to notify the new legislation. Though in some states arrests have been made under the new Act, elsewhere culprits have been booked for ‘dowry harassment’ and ‘domestic violence’. Like previously, while some perpetrators have uttered talaq thrice in front of the victims, there have been instances when husbands have given instant divorce over phone and even WhatsApp. Apart from reporting the maximum number of triple talaq incidents since August 1 this year, Uttar Pradesh has also seen a couple of gruesome cases – in one case a victim was burnt to death in front of her daughter and another victim’s nose was chopped off to force her to withdraw her complaint. A 22-year-old woman was allegedly burnt alive by her husband and in-laws in front of her five-year-old daughter at Gadra village in Shravasti district on August 16 night after she went to lodge a police complaint on being given triple talaq. The deceased’s father Ramzan Khan has alleged that his son-in-law Nafees (26), who works in Mumbai, had given triple talaq to his daughter Sayeeda over phone on August 6. A woman in Sitapur has alleged that her nose was cut off by her in-laws after she refused to withdraw the triple talaq case she had filed against her husband on August 8. Police said the instant talaq was pronounced over phone and counselling was being done for both sides. When the matter was taken under the new Act, the woman was allegedly beaten up by her in-laws and her nose chopped to mount pressure on her to withdraw the case. In Unnao district, one Fakruddin gave triple talaq to his wife Shahnaz Begum in a crowded market while she was shopping with her brother and uncle. Fakruddin has been booked under the newly enacted talaq law that provides for three-year jail. In Lucknow, one Syed Rashid allegedly gave triple talaq to his wife Simmi right inside the civil court premises in the presence of her advocate after she refused to accept a chewing gum from him, police said on Tuesday. Simmi had gone to the court for the hearing of her case of dowry harassment that she had lodged earlier against her in-laws.

" Jamiat moves SC, challenges validity of law criminalising triple talaq | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind on Thursday moved the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of ‘Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019’, which punishes Muslim men who divorce their wives through talaq-e-biddat, or triple talaq, claiming that the legislation is discriminatory and inflicts disproportionate punishment for a civil wrong. Giving details of social work since its establishment in 1919, the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind through advocate Ejaz Maqbool argued the legislation passed by Parliament on July 31 was unnecessary as the Supreme Court had on August 22, 2017 declared the practice of instant divorce through triple talaq as unconstitutional. The Jamiat had argued before the SC in the Shayara Bano case that “triple talaq was protected under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution and formed part of the personal laws of the Hanafi Muslims under Sharia”. A year after the SC ruling, the Union government on September 19, 2018 promulgated Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2018 providing for imprisonment of up to three years for Muslim men who resort to triple talaq for instantaneous divorce. The ordinance was re-promulgated twice before Parliament finally enacted a law which received the President’s assent on July 31 this year. The petitioner termed Section 4 of the Act, prescribing punishment of up to three years’ imprisonment with fine, as an ill-conceived provision imposing excessive and discriminatory penalty on Muslim men resorting to triple talaq. “Lesser punishment is prescribed in Indian Penal Code for many offences which are far graver - rioting (2 years), bribery (one year), food adulteration (six months), causing death due to rash and negligent driving (2 years),” it said. The Jamiat said under Hindu law, desertion of a spouse is not an offence but only a ground for divorce. Moreover, the new legislation has made pronouncement of triple talaq a cognizable and non-bailable offence whereas causing death by rash and negligent driving is a bailable offence. The petitioner said, “Crime and punishment are two sides of the same coin. Every punishment must be proportionate to the crime. The notion ‘just deserts’ require that a sentence being imposed must be proportionate to the offender’s culpability is applicable to criminal jurisprudence.” “There are several more grave offences which are not punishable with such a stringent punishment and are bailable. In fact, desertion of a wife by the husband under Hindu law is not even an offence. This clearly shows that the provisions, as far as related to criminality of pronouncement of triple talaq, are disproportionate and excessive ... and deserves to be set aside as being violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution,” the petition said.

 Plea in SC challenging new law on 'triple talaq' | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Thursday challenging the newly enacted law which makes the practice of instant divorce through 'triple talaq' among Muslims a punishable offence entailing imprisonment of up to three years. The fresh plea has been filed by Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind, a Muslim body, which sought to declare The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 as ""unconstitutional"" on the ground that it allegedly violates the provisions of the Constitution. President Ram Nath Kovind has given assent to the Act which makes 'talaq-e-biddat' or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband void and illegal. Earlier this month, 'Samastha Kerala Jamiathul Ulema', a religious organisation of Sunni Muslim scholars and clerics in Kerala, had also moved the apex court seeking to declare the newly enacted law as ""unconstitutional"". In the plea filed through advocate Ejaz Maqbool, Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind has claimed that since the pronouncement of talaq by a Muslim husband upon his wife had already been declared ""void and illegal"", there was no requirement to enact the law. ""However, the impugned Act criminalises the act of pronouncement of talaq by a Muslim husband and makes it a cognizable offence, without appreciating that such pronouncement had already been declared unconstitutional and amounted to nullity in the eyes of law,"" the plea said. Referring to the provision of the Act which stipulates punishment of up to three years jail along with fine, the plea said it is an ""ill-conceived provision which imposes excessive and disproportionate punishment."" It claimed that ""criminalising a mode of divorce in one particular religion while keeping the subject of marriage and divorce in other religions only within the purview of civil law, also leads to discrimination, which is not in conformity with the mandate of Article 15"". Article 15 of the Constitution deals with prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. The plea said that punishment prescribed under the Act ""is not only disproportionate but extremely excessive and stringent"". Referring to other offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including rioting, bribery and causing death by negligence, the plea said that lesser punishment has been prescribed for many offences ""which are far graver"". It said that section 7 of The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 makes the pronouncement of talaq, having the effect of instantaneous divorce, a cognisable and a non-bailable offence. The plea said that offences like kidnapping, causing death by negligence and bigamy, are bailable ""which show that making the pronouncement of instantaneous talaq non-bailable is excessive and evidently unwarranted"". ""As mentioned above, there are several more grave offences which are not punishable with such a stringent punishment and are bailable, in fact desertion of a wife by the husband is not even an offence, this clearly shows that the provisions qua criminality of the pronouncement of instantaneous talaq are disproportionate and excessive,"" it said. The plea said that marriage is civil contract as per the Islamic Law and talaq is only a mode to repudiate the contract and imposition of criminal liability for a civil wrong violates the fundamental rights of Muslim men. It said that ""object of punishment must not be to wreak vengeance but to reform the criminal as to prevent him from further crime."" The plea said that the Act, by providing for imprisonment of the husband, fails to ensure cordiality in marriage and would lead to ""irretrievable breakdown"" of the wedlock. It said pronouncement of 'triple talaq' is considered invalid in several Islamic countries but no punishment has been prescribed for this. The Act makes it illegal to pronounce talaq three times -- spoken, written or through SMS or WhatsApp or any other electronic chat -- in one sitting. ""Any pronouncement of talaq by a Muslim husband upon his wife, by words, either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever, shall be void and illegal,"" the law says.

UP: Newly wed wife complains of ‘unnatural sex’ and ‘forced abortion’ after husband gives talaq over phone | Meerut News - Times of India,"AMROHA: A 22-year-old woman has alleged that her husband has given her instant triple talaaq over the phone, just a month and a half into their marriage, after she complained to her mother-in-law and sister-in-law of her husband forcing her to abort. The woman alleged her husband, a resident of Joya under Didoli police station in Amroha, of “forced unnatural sex”, as well as “forced abortion” by his brother, a quack. When she complained to her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, they locked her up in a room, from where she eventually had to be rescued by police. Thereafter, she left for her parent’s home in Moradabad, where she received the phone call over which her husband gave her talaaq. An FIR has been filed in the case, and search is on for the absconding husband. Iram Khan got married to Umair Alam (25), who lives in Pradhanowala mohalla of Joya in Amroha on July 8. According to the woman, “Since our marriage, my husband mostly forced me to have ‘unnatural sex’ with him. A month into our marriage, I conceived, but he didn’t want a child, and got his brother Gulam Mohammad, a quack, to inspect me. When he confirmed my pregnancy, the brothers administered me some pills for abortion. My health started deteriorating. I complained to my mother-in-law-Shahnaz and sister-in-law Gulnaz. They got angry, beat me up, and some days ago, locked me inside a room. After I dialed 100, police reached the house and set me free.” “Afterwards, I left for my maternal house. On Monday evening, my husband called me on the phone, but without allowing me to speak, gave me instant triple talaaq,” she alleged. On Tuesday evening, she approached Didoli cops and filed a complaint against her husband, brother-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law. Didoli SHO Sharad Malik said, “Police has registered a case against four persons, including the husband, brother-in-law, sister-in-law and mother-in-law, under sections 377, 498, 323 and 313 of IPC. Sections 377 and 498 were imposed only on the husband, while the rest were booked under sections 323 and 313.

 Assam Congress charges PM with diverting people's attention from economic slowdown | India News - Times of India,"GUWAHATI: The Congress in Assam on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of diverting the attention of the people from the economic slowdown by bringing up issues such as Article 370, triple talaq and Ram Mandir. There are signs of severe slowdown in the Indian economy under the Narendra Modi government, state Congress president Ripun Bora told a press conference here. The GDP growth rate has declined to 5.8 per cent between January-March this year, inflation rate is 3.2 per cent, Bora claimed. Tax revenue has declined, unemployment rate is high and real estate and automobile sectors have nearly stalled, the Congress leader said. ""The prime minister is bringing up issues like Art 370, triple talaq and Ram Mandir to divert the attention of the people from the economic slowdown,"" Bora alleged. He also quoted a global economic organisation report which asserted that a great depression will hit India in the next six months. Bora said, ""There is over six per cent rate of unemployment which is the highest in the last 45 years. There is also huge job loss since the demonetisation. Ten lakh jobs are estimated to be lost in the next two months."" Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh had termed Modi's economic policy as a ""monumental failure"", he said.

Telangana state waqf board in a bind over triple talaq | Hyderabad News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: Qazis are in a dilemma over instant triple talaq cases even as the Telangana state waqf board has washed its hands of the issue saying triple talaq is a “private matter” between a man and his divorced wife and thus, it will not interfere. Qazis perform and dissolve marriages and are under the supervision of the state waqf board. Only the state waqf board is authorised to issue marriage and divorce certificates of Muslims based on the documents (nikahnama or talaqnama) provided by the local qazi. The board now says it will not make any changes in the existing nikahnama (marriage booklet with terms and conditions signed by bride and groom). It will only verbally caution the couple that instant triple talaq is illegal and punishable with a jail sentence. With Parliament banning instant triple talaq, it is illegal on the part of a Muslim man to divorce his wife in a single proclamation. Even if instant triple talaq is pronounced, it is null and void under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019. Under the new legislation, the marriage continues to be valid and the qazi cannot issue talaqnama. Some Muslim religious scholars, however, say that if the woman does not lodge a police complaint, instant triple talaq can be treated as a normal divorce with talaq pronounced over three sittings with a gap of one month between sittings and after mediation by elders fail to convince the couple. This will save a man from going to jail. State waqf board chairman Mohammad Saleem told TOI that instant triple talaq is an issue between a divorced woman and her husband and the board has no role to play. Asked whether the board will issue divorce certificates in case of instant triple talaq, Saleem said that it will issue certificates even in triple talaq cases provided there is no objection from the victim woman. In case the woman lodges a police complaint, he said, the board cannot issue divorce certificate as the marriage continues to be in vogue after instant triple talaq. A senior qazi, who does not want to be quoted, said many Muslim religious scholars do not want to penalise the man, who gives triple talaq. “Pressure is on us to treat instant triple talaq as normal talaq and issue divorce certificates after waiting for three months, as mandated in the Holy Quran,” he said. Anwar Ahmad, a senior Mufti of leading deemed Islamic university, Jamia Nizamia, Hyderabad, said there have been no cases of instant triple talaq in the city after Parliament nullified the practice last month. “The divorce rate among Muslims is minuscule, though often it is projected as a major problem in the principal minority community,” he said adding that since instant triple talaq is banned by central legislation, the only option left is to practice the normal triple talaq spread over three months with sustained efforts of mediation in the interregnum.

"UP: Bike, chewing gum spur two triple talaq cases in 24 hours | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Two cases of triple talaq were reported within a span of 24 hours in the state, taking the total number to nine in August. The first case was reported from Hardoi on Tuesday. Afsana, a resident of Kachauna village under Kamlapur police station, told police that husband Naushad decided to abandon her because her family couldn’t buy him a bike even three months after the wedding. “I married Naushad on June 10.

Kanpur: Man gets bail in case of triple talaq under new law | Kanpur News - Times of India,"KANPUR :The sessions court on Tuesday granted conditional bail to a man in a matter of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act. Presiding judge Balkrishna N Ranjan (Addl district and sessions judge, court 11th) of Kanpur Nagar in his order quoted the provisions of section 4 and 7 C of the Act and observed that legal formality under section 7 C, which were mandatory, appears to be fulfilled before the magistrate. The prosecution had not submitted any evidence against the accused, Sajid Nafees, to hold him guilty in any matter prima facie. In view of the totality and without commenting anything on the merit of the case there is sufficient ground for granting bail to the accused. Hence, the bail application on certain conditions is being granted on submission of two sureties of Rs 40,000 each and a personal bond of like amount, the court observed. The accused had been detained in the district jail since August 8, 2019, and since then the case was being heard by the magistrate. Under the bail conditions, the accused would neither exert pressure on the witnesses nor disturb the evidence during the trial and will be present in person before the court on every date or make his appearance through his counsel. Moreover, he would neither change his residence nor leave the city without seeking permission from the court. Further, he will have to submit affidavits about his all temporary and permanent addresses along with copy of Aadhaar card. If his Aadhaar card is not made, then he would have to obtain the card within a month and submit it before the court. According to advocates, this is the first ever bail granted under Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Bill-2019 in the city. The prosecution stated in the court that complainant Fariya Nayyar had lodged a complaint on August 7, 2019 around 10.37pm at Chakeri police station and stated that she was married to Sajid Nafees on October 20, 2007. Her mother-in-law Atiya Begum and father-in-law Nafeesul Hassan were annoyed with her as she could not give birth to any child. They even used to say that they would marry their son again with some other woman. Under this threat, they had demanded Rs. 18 lakh from her parents. Meanwhile, she came to know that Sajid had married second time with the consent of his parents on August 6, 2019. When she protested, they not only thrashed her but abused her father too who had gone to settle the matter. Sajid said talaq three times in a row and divorced her. The police on the report of Fariya registered a case against the accused under section 498 A/323/504/506 IPC, 3/4 Anti-Dowry Act and u/s 4 of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act-2019. The defence countered the statement and stated that it was a false and fabricated story based on confusing facts. Fariya was a divorcee woman, who had obtained consideration on the basis of a dowry case from her first husband. Due to her behaviour, he had left his parent's house and shifted to Greater Noida along with her. During their matrimonial life, they could not become parents. He had wound up his business in Noida and came back to Kanpur once again. His main dispute with Fariya was about legal adoption of child. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

 Why 10 Rajya Sabha MPs quit in 45 days during Parliament’s budget session | India News - Times of India,"After the 17th Lok Sabha election, the BJP has grown stronger not just in the Lower House but also in the Rajya Sabha. During the budget session, which concluded earlier this month, as many as 10 Rajya Sabha MPs from the opposition benches resigned from their parties. While five of these 10 MPs switched over to the BJP, the remaining five resigned from the Upper House and later joined the ruling party. On the other hand, not a single Lok Sabha MP resigned in the same period. On June 20, four of the six Rajya Sabha MPs of Telugu Desam Party (TDP), including party chief N Chandrababu Naidu's close confidantes YS Chowdary and CM Ramesh, joined the BJP. On June 26, the lone MP of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) Ram Kashyap joined the BJP. On July 15, Neeraj Shekhar, son of former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar, was the first to quit the Samajwadi Party (SP) and join the BJP. He has been fielded in the Rajya Sabha bypoll in Uttar Pradesh. On July 31, Congress MP Sanjay Sinh quit both the party and his Rajya Sabha seat to join the BJP. On August 2, second SP MP Surendra Singh Nagar resigned from the Rajya Sabha and later joined the BJP. His Rajya Sabha term ended in 2022. On August 5, in a major embarrassment for the Congress, its chief whip in Rajya Sabha, Bhubhaneshwar Kalita, quit the party and his Upper House seat just ahead of the revocation of Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir. The same day, the third SP MP Sanjay Seth too resigned from the Rajya Sabha and the party. He too joined the BJP on August 10 along with Nagar. Seth's resignation came as a major jolt to the SP because he was not just the party's national treasurer but was also considered close to the Yadav family. In a span of 45 days, 10 Rajya Sabha MPs resigned and joined the BJP. What BJP getsThe BJP enjoys an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha with 303 of the 543 MPs belonging to it. Along with its NDA partners, it has 353 MPs in the Lower House, which is almost two-thirds majority. In such a scenario, the BJP is in a comfortable position to get bills, including constitution amendment bills which require two-thirds majority, passed. However, the ruling party does not have majority in the 245-member Rajya Sabha, which includes 12 nominated MPs. The BJP desperately needs the numbers in the Rajya Sabha. At the start of the last budget session, the BJP had 73 MPs in the Upper House. After four MPs of the TDP and the lone MP of INLD joined it, the party's number rose to 78 by the time the house adjourned sine die on August 7. However, its number is set to increase to 83 after the five MPs who had resigned get reelected in the course of time. Along with its NDA partners, its strength was 100 and which grew to 105 after the defections. Their tally is likely to touch 110 after the bypolls are held. This would still be 13 short of the majority mark of 123. But the BJP did not get the support of all its ally, Nitish Kumar-led JDU, on at least two occasions - during voting on the triple talaq bill, popularly known as the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill and Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganisation) Bill. Both the bills, particularly the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganisation) Bill, sailed through due to the help the BJP got from non-allies parties such as the BSP, YSRCP, BJD, TRS and TDP. While the triple talaq bill passed with 99 votes in favour and 84 against, the bill on Jammu and Kashmir got the support of 125 MPs and 61 voting against it. The BJP is in a hurry to cross the 123 mark and even touch two-thirds majority to ensure that crucial bills do not face difficulty in seeing the light of day. On the other hand, the strength of the Congress-led Opposition has weakened roughly to 100 with the main opposition party having 46 MPs. What defectors getThe MPs who have resigned from other parties to join the BJP do not get much. However, they have one solace that they represent the ruling parties. Secondly, in bypolls they have an assurance that they would get reelected in the Rajya Sabha bypolls because of the indirect election. The candidates fielded by parties ruling in the states have better prospects to get elected. This is unlike the Lok Sabha election where the voters directly elect the candidates. This makes the result unpredictable. Therefore, while not a single Lok Sabha MP from the opposition parties has resigned to join the BJP, 10 of the Rajya Sabha have quit to join the ruling party in the last couple of months.

In her complaint to police, Ujma said that she got married to Akhtar in 2013 and he along with her parents would often torture her demanding for dowry. She resisted informing her family and police to save her marriage but it went off board when he gave triple talaq and decided to abandon her. Koriya SP Vivek Shukla confirmed that Dilshad had asked Ujma to leave the house saying 'triple talaq' following which, a case was registered under Section 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 against her husband. Other sections of the IPC were also lodged against Akhtar and his family members under the IPC for criminal intimidation, obscene acts and voluntarily causing hurt. Akhtar was arrested and other members were being questioned, police said. The woman is five month pregnant and mother of three children. This is the first arrest in state under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 after the Parliament passed the triple talaq bill last month and the President gave his assent to it.

UP woman beaten to death by in-laws; family says she had refused to accept triple talaq | Lucknow News - Times of India,"SHRAVASTI: A 22-year-old woman was allegedly beaten to death by her husband and in-laws and the body set on fire here, police said on Monday, as her family claimed she was killed because she had refused to accept talaq given to her on phone. According to superintendent of police Ashish Srivastava, the incident was reported on Friday from Gadra village near the India-Nepal border. Saeeda and Nafees, both residents of the same village, married about six years ago. Nafees works in Mumbai and they have two children. Saeeda's father Ramzan told reporters on Saturday that his daughter was often beaten up by her husband and in-laws. On August 6, Nafees divorced Saeeda on phone, he said. The practice of triple talaq has been criminalised by a law passed by Parliament last month. The father said Nafees had returned home for Eid-al-Adha and this Friday, both sides agreed to a compromise and Nafees took Saeeda with him inside their home. He and his family members then killed Saeeda and burnt her body, Ramzan said, adding this was done in presence of his six-year-old grand daughter.

"Amit Shah: Narendra Modi a reformer, ended the trend of appeasement | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Home minister and BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday accused Congress of inflicting “politics of appeasement” on the country with an eye on vote-bank, which resulted in Partition in 1947 and led to continuance of the “evil practice” of triple talaq. Speaking on ‘Abolition of Triple Talaq: Correcting a Historical Wrong’, organised by the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Research Foundation, Shah said triple talaq could be criminalised due to the will power of PM Modi as he equated him with other leading social reformers of the country, whose contributions shaped an egalitarian and democratic society. Shah defended the law criminalising triple talaq, asserting that it establishes gender equality. “In the 60s Indian democracy was infected with three cancers — dynastic succession, casteism and appeasement — which has been pursued by Congress till date. However, as a member of BJP, I can say proudly that our leader PM Modi has turned a reformer by putting an end to the trends of dynasty, casteism and appeasement,” he said. Shah assured Muslim women that their constitutional rights will be protected by the current dispensation. “There has not been shortage of social reformers, who were born in different ages. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Mahatama Gandhi, Jyotiba Phule, Dr Ambedkar and Vir Savarkar, who had launched social reform movements against untouchability, child marriage and for widow remarriage. Today Narendra Modi’s name has also been included in the list of these great reformers after ban on triple talaq, which was infringing on the right of equality to Muslim women,” the BJP chief said. Citing findings of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan which said over 92% of Muslim women wanted to get rid of the triple talaq, Shah said, “When Modi became Prime Minister again, he immediately worked on the promise he had made to Muslim women in 2018 and triple talaq was banned in one go.” Shah said election of Modi as PM in 2014 was the beginning of the end of politics of appeasement and the 2019 mandate is to end it forever.

 Politics of appeasement was reason for continuance of triple talaq: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah said on Sunday the politics of appeasement, which led to the Partition, was the reason for the continuance of the ""evil practice"" of triple talaq for so long. Speaking at an event in the national capital, Shah defended the law criminalising triple talaq, asserting that it establishes gender equality. ""Some people level allegations against BJP government that such action is anti-Muslim. I want to make it clear that this is only and only to benefit Muslims, not the Hindus, Jains or Christians,"" he said. It was a ""nightmare"" for crores of Muslim women who were denied of their rights, he said. He said 92.1 per cent of Muslim women supported criminalisation of triple talaq. Coming down heavily on the Congress, Shah, who is also the BJP president, said the grand old party has ""no shame"" and continues to oppose the law on triple talaq. The home minister said it took several decades to end this evil practice because of the Congress, which always resorted to the politics of appeasement. Referring to the then Rajiv Gandhi government's decision to bring a law to overturn the Supreme Court judgement in the Shah Bano case, he said it would be considered a ""black day"" in the history of Parliament. There is no doubt in the minds of those favouring triple talaq and those opposing it that it was an ""evil practice"". People should welcome moves for eradication of any evil practice, but there is opposition in case of triple talaq. ""The politics of appeasement is responsible for it,"" he said. Some parties were in the habit of coming to power on the basis of vote-bank politics, that's why such evil practices continued, he said. The politics of appeasement has been a hurdle in the path to achieve development and social cohesion in the country. ""When some people are hungry for power, they resort to the politics of appeasement. They are not concerned about Muslim women but concerned only about vote-bank, "" he said. But, ""when your intention is social uplift, you have to work hard for it, you have to plan it,"" he said. ""The election of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister in 2014 was the beginning of the end of politics of appeasement and the 2019 mandate is to end it forever,"" said Shah. The home minister asked why so many Muslim countries ended the practice if triple talaq was part of Islamic culture . ""That means this evil practice is anti-Islam and Islam does not support it. As many as 19 countries have ended triple talq between 1922 and 1963,"" he said. ""This evil practice of triple talaq was going on for long and the Modi government has abolished it forever and given the Muslim women the right to live in dignity and equality,"" he said. Shah said many people said it was a civil matter, so why did you criminalise it. ""When 'Sati pratha' (self immolation by Hindu widows) was abolished, no one opposed it. When child marriage was ended, no one opposed it. In case of child marriage, there is a provision for two years jail. Similarly, dowry is a civil matter. In dowry case, if a demand is made, there is a provision for two years' imprisonment,"" he said. ""Triple talaq has been criminalised to educate people, to create fear among some people that if you do this, you will be punished. Earlier, triple talaq had no provision for maintenance for women. Now, we have made provision for maintenance,"" he said. The home minister said he wanted forgiveness from Muslim women as they had to suffer for long because of this evil practice. ""I wish you a bright future ahead and want to assure you that I would leave no stone unturned to ensure your social security,"" he said. Shah flagged three issues which he said were threat to Indian democracy - casteism, dynastic politics and appeasement. Read this story in Marathi""The Modi government has ended all these three and has been working for the all-round development of all classes of people. Our government will leave no stone unturned to fulfil the aspirations of people,"" he said. He also said the NDA government does not function on the basis of casteism, dynastic politics and appeasement. ""We believe that everyone should get equal opportunity on the basis of talents,"" he said. The home minister said in the five-and-a-half years, the Modi government has taken more than 25 historic decisions which are giving the country a new direction. ""This is a reflection of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decisive leadership,"" he said. Shah was speaking on 'Abolition of Triple Talaq: Correcting a Historic Wrong' at an event organised by the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Research Foundation here. The legislation to criminalise instant triple talaq was passed by Parliament last month. The triple talaq act makes declaration of talaq-e-biddat or pronouncing talaq three times in spoken, written or through SMS or WhatsApp or any other electronic chat in one sitting illegal. Criminalising the offence, it gives a police officer powers to arrest the offender without requiring a warrant. To check misuse of cognisable nature of the offence, the legislation makes declaration of talaq-e-biddat a criminal offence only if the complaint is filed by the aggrieved woman or any of her relation by blood or marriage. A magistrate can grant bail only after hearing the aggrieved woman. The aggrieved woman is entitled to demand a maintenance for her and her dependent children under the legislation.

Kerala records first triple talaq arrest | Kozhikode News - Times of India,"KOZHIKODE: A 32-year-old man was arrested for giving instant triple talaq to his wife, the first such case registered in the state, after the practice was criminalized, police said on Friday. E K Usman of Kumaranellur was arrested after a woman named Rajna K (26) complained against her husband before the Thamarassery Judicial First-Class Magistrate (JFCM) Court. The court issued a warrant against the accused and he was arrested under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019. In her petition, Rajna stated that the accused came to her house on August 1 and divorced her after pronouncing talaq three times on her without following Islamic laws. She pointed out that the talaq was performed without her consent or knowledge. Though the woman approached Mukkom police with a complaint against her husband the next day, they did not register a case, said K P Philip, Rajna's advocate. Her counsels then filed a petition before the JFCM court on August 8 against the triple talaq. The court issued the arrest warrant against the accused on August 9. Though the normal procedure is to issue a summons, the court issued the warrant after the petitioner said that the accused might leave the country if the arrest is delayed. As per the petition, the Rajna got married to Usman on May 25, 2018. She said it was an unhappy marriage and that she was mentally and physically tortured by her husband. She was taken to Qatar and after coming back to Kerala, she was sent to her home, the petitioner alleged. She also stated in her petition that her passport and other documents were kept in the custody of the accused. The petition also alleged that Usman divorced the petitioner after marrying another woman. The Triple Talaq Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on July 25, 2019, and by the Rajya Sabha on July 30, 2019. The accused has been charged under Section 3 (any pronouncement of talaq by a Muslim husband upon his wife, by words, either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever, shall be void and illegal) and 4 (any Muslim husband who pronounces talaq shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine) of the Act. Usman was produced in the court and it granted him bail but he was directed to surrender his passport. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Mumbai’s first triple talaq case after Act, 37-year-old mother of two files complaint | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Two weeks after the triple talaq bill became an Act, Nagpada police registered the city’s first case under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. On Wednesday, a 37-year-old dietician approached Nagpada police and lodged a complaint against her husband under sections of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 and 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code. The incident dates back to November 2018. The husband, Anwar Ali Sayyed, 39, is yet to be arrested. The wife has said her husband had given her instant talaq in November 2018. A resident of Mumbra in Thane had filed the first case in Maharashtra against her husband for giving her instant divorce. Her husband, Imtiyaz Patel, had approached Bombay high court and expressed willingness for mediation. The court has given him interim relief from arrest. In the Nagpada case, the woman has told police she got married in 2005 and went to live with her husband in Ahmednagar. On learning he was unemployed, she returned to Mumbai and started living in her parental home. She started working as a dietician with a private firm. Her husband later came to Mumbai and tried his hand at several businesses, but without any success. Sayyed then allegedly began asking for money from his wife and this was a cause of constant fights between them. In 2009, the woman delivered twin girls. A few years later, Sayyed took the twins to Ahmednagar. However, the woman brought one of the children to Mumbai. In November 2018, the couple had another fight over Sayyed’s lack of a job when he gave instant talaq to his wife. “We are probing the case. Sayyed has not been arrested. One child is with the wife and another with Sayyed,” said a senior police officer. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Narendra Modi: Population explosion a worry, govt schemes needed to control it | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday placed the issue of “population explosion” on the national front-burner, calling it a challenge and exhorting the Centre and states to devise schemes to tackle it. In his Independence Day speech from the Red Fort, Modi said the rising population was a cause for worry and posed new challenges for the present and the future. He said citizens with small families needed to be held up as role models as their decision was an expression of patriotism and love for the nation. Modi’s reference to “population explosion” came as a surprise as it was after a long interval that a PM gave the issue any prominence. It also marked a break from the pattern over the past 10-15 years where the bulging numbers were seen as an asset, with the term “demographic dividend” deployed to underline the benefits they could bring. The other big theme in the PM’s speech was predictably the decision to do away with Jammu & Kashmir’s special status and to create two Union territories of J&K and Ladakh. The dream of “one nation, one Constitution” had been realised and those who oppose the decision should explain why they did not make Article 370 permanent when they were in office, he said. Talking about population control, Modi focused on the disadvantages of unrestrained numbers. “If the population is not educated, not healthy, then neither the home nor the country can be happy. If the population is educated, empowered and skilled and has adequate means available to achieve the right ambience to fulfil their wishes and needs, then I think the country can fulfil these things,” the Prime Minister said. He suggested that the problem had been dodged so far with an eye on political advantage. “The time has now come that we should take (such) challenges head on,” he said. Modi was all praise for citizens who have chosen to restrict the size of their families. “In our society, there is a section which is very well aware of the consequences of uncontrolled population growth. They deserve our accolades and respect. This is an expression of their love for the nation. Before having a baby, they take a well-considered decision whether they will be able to take care of their child’s needs,” the PM said. Further emphasising his point, he said, “Not only do they (small households) contribute to the welfare of their family but also to the good of the nation. People who have played this huge role need to be honoured, and by setting them as examples we need to inspire the segment of society still not thinking on these lines. We need to worry about population explosion.” Modi said the Centre and states should come up with different schemes. The PM dwelt at length on the decision to revoke J&K’s special status and bifurcate it, and underlined that two-thirds support in both Houses of Parliament reflected that the move enjoyed wide support and was a task waiting to be done as old approaches to resolving issues had failed. “Today, I can say with pride that every Indian can say we are one nation, one Constitution. And this one dream of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has been realised,” the PM said. He took a swipe at Congress and said, “The country asks them: if Article 370 or 35A were so necessary, then despite such a majority, why didn’t you make it permanent? Why did you leave it as temporary? This means that even you know what happened was not right, but you did not have the courage to rectify it or the political will,” he said. Referring to the creation of two UTs, he said, “The new system in place is for direct benefit of the people on the ground. Now everyone living in Jammu & Kashmir can directly question the Centre.” He said the discriminatory provisions of Article 35A, which flow from Article 370, restricted the rights of women and deprived Dalits and tribals of political reservation. Modi referred to reading down of Article 370 and passage of the legislation to ban triple talaq as reflecting the government’s resolve neither to keep problems pending nor to nurture them. “If we can raise our voice against the practice of Sati, we thought why can’t we raise our voice against triple talaq.” he said. The PM used his sixth straight speech from Red Fort, and his first after re-election, to promise a stepped-up pace of development. “India does not want to wait too long for incremental progress. A high jump is needed, our thought process has to be expanded,” he said while speaking of the government’s plan to invest Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure-building. “People’s trust in us has given us new strength. The 2019 mandate shows hopelessness has given way to hope,” he said. Modi also stressed the government’s focus on “ease of living” beyond “ease of doing business” and said the objective was to ensure that the administration would intrude as little as possible in people’s lives. As part of his theme that India can now up its game in the community of nations, the PM said measures against corruption would continue unabated, adding there was no room for slackness as graft was like a disease that returned at the first opportunity.

 Took call on talaq law in just 10 weeks: PM | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the law against triple talaq as a singular achievement of his government in its second term. Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights of On Marriage) Act, 2019 in July after the government managed to get adequate support in Rajya Sabha where it doesn’t enjoy majority. “In just ten weeks, we made big ticket decisions like bringing about a law against Triple Talaq to protect the rights of our Muslim women,” the PM said in his Independence Day address as he listed other decisions like major amendments in the anti-terror law and transfer of approximately Rs 90,000 crore to the bank accounts of farmers under who are beneficiaries of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana. “You would have seen how our Muslim daughters and sisters used to live in fear with the sword of triple talaq dangling over their heads. Even if they were not victims of triple talaq, they were constantly haunted by the fear that they could be subjected to it any time,” he said. The PM pointed out that many Islamic countries had abolished this evil practice long time back. “But for some reason, we were hesitant to give our Muslim mothers and sisters their due rights. If, we can abolish Sati, if we can enact laws to end female foeticide, if we can raise our voice against child marriage, if we can take strong steps against dowry, then why can’t we raise our voice against triple talaq?” the PM asked. He said the decision on law against triple talaq was taken in the spirit of India’s democracy and Constitution “so that our Muslim sisters get equal rights; so that new confidence is generated in them; so that they also become active participants in the India’s development journey. Such decisions are not for political gains”. The PM also highlighted the amendments brought to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. “Now-a- days, we come across incidents of child rights violations all over the world and India will not leave her children vulnerable. A much warranted stringent law to protect child rights was needed and has been enacted,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Freed Muslim women from fear of triple talaq: PM Narendra Modi | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said Muslim women were forced to live under the fear of instant triple talaq and his government ended their suffering by criminalising the practice.

" Majorities pass legislations, but consensus is the healthy option, says Om Birla | India News - Times of India","Satisfied with the way the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha went by, Speaker Om Birla tells Akhilesh Singh he is confident of maintaining the momentum in the upcoming sessions and urged MPs to uphold the sanctity of their position. Excerpts from the interview:The recent session saw maximum productivity and a large number of bills were passed. It has been a good start as Lok Sabha Speaker. A majority is the obvious requirement for successful legislation. But, cooperation of all parties and consensus is a healthy practice for parliamentary democracy. I am fortunate that most parties responded and helped in running the House smoothly. I am confident of maintaining the momentum in upcoming sessions. Most speakers were given adequate time to put forth their views. I drew a few lessons from my own parliamentary experience and one of my priorities was to see maximum number of first-time MPs got an opportunity to speak. Once elected Speaker, one has to rise above party lines and remain impartial. The session saw passage of several contentious bills like triple talaq and Articles 370 and 35A.Credit goes to floor leaders and the confidence of parties in the legislative process... several bills, which had lingered for years, were passed in the first session of 17th Lok Sabha. There was a wrong perception about Parliament due to frequent disruptions. However, I made it clear that no adjournment would take place as we had an opportunity to send a positive message. Several legislations impacting lives of common citizens were passed without voting, which reflected MPs’ sensitivity towards human issues. More than 100 MPs had 100% attendance in House, which itself was quite satisfying. Opposition parties alleged that several bills were not referred to standing committees and were rushed through without consultations. The opposition’s basic complaint was that they be given copy of bills at least a day before being introduced in the House. Standing committees were not constituted in the first session. Therefore, I ensured that enough time was given for debate on bills so that interested parties could express their views. On several bills, debates were conducted far beyond stipulated time. Of 35 bills cleared by Lok Sabha, 30 were passed with consensus or without voting and the House functioned for 280 hours in 37 sittings. You recently said that experts will be roped in to explain features of a bill to lawmakers once tabled in the House. Do you think it will make a meaningful difference?I am confident of better results through this process. Most of the bills are finalised in the business advisory committee in advance. Experts will be there from 9 am to 10 am to brief MPs about features of the bills. Lok Sabha secretariat will also provide online copies of bills to all MPs. On some bills, the viewpoints of the government and of neutral experts will be sent to MPs. The plan is to update MPs about key aspects so that they are well prepared to participate in the debate. The recent session will also be remembered for some acrimonious moments like Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan’s ‘sexist’ comments.Parliament is a sacrosanct place where legislators represent their constituencies. As they are elected with support of lakhs of voters, they should understand the sanctity of the position they are holding. There were moments of embarrassment when some members made unsolicited remarks. We certainly need to work on how to avoid such situations. There has been a tradition of expunging remarks from the records but it has been ineffective due to live coverage of proceedings. Any plan to ensure decorum in the House?We have a tradition of correcting the debate but in the age of live coverage, it has become meaningless as by the time corrections are done, it is too late. People have watched what we intend to filter. It’s a precarious situation as it is very difficult to ensure that unsolicited remarks don’t reach the public domain. Rule books will not be enough, rather behavioural changes will be more effective. As we saw in Karnataka, state speakers often keep decisions on disqualification pending for long. Do you think speakers should act promptly?Once elected as Speaker, one should rise above party politics and work as per the norms of the chair. Decisions should be purely on merit and certainly not driven by ideology or political affiliations. It is easier said than done but one must respect the chair and not take a decision denigrating the chair. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
India Independence Day speech: President Ram Nath Kovind Independence Day speech: Full text | India News - Times of India,"Dear fellow citizens  I offer you my greetings on the eve of our 73rd Independence Day. This is a happy and emotional day for all children of Mother India, whether living at home or abroad. We remember with gratitude the countless freedom fighters and revolutionaries who struggled, strived and made heroic sacrifices to win us our freedom from colonial rule.  We complete 72 years as a free nation at a very special juncture. In a few weeks from now, on October 2nd, we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of our Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, the guiding light of our successful effort to liberate our nation and of our continuing effort to reform our society of all inequities.  Contemporary India is very different from the India in which Mahatma Gandhi lived and worked. Even so, Gandhiji remains extremely relevant. In his advocacy of sustainability, ecological sensitivity and living in harmony with nature, he anticipated pressing challenges of our times.  When we design and deliver welfare programmes for our disadvantaged fellow citizens and families, when we seek to harness the power of the sun as renewable energy, we put Gandhian philosophy into action.  This year also marks the 550th birth anniversary of one of the greatest, wisest and most influential Indians of all time – Guru Nanak Devji. He was the founder of Sikhism, but the reverence and respect he commands go far beyond just our Sikh brothers and sisters. They extend to millions of others in India and across the world. My best wishes to them on this pious occasion. Fellow citizens,  The illustrious generation that led us to freedom did not perceive independence only in terms of transfer of political power. They considered it a stepping stone in a longer and larger process of nation building and national welding. Their objective was to improve the life of each individual, each family and of society as a whole.  In this backdrop, I am confident that the recent changes made in Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh would be of immense benefit to those regions. They will enable the people to access and enjoy the same rights, same privileges and same facilities as their fellow citizens in the rest of the country. These include progressive, egalitarian laws and provisions related to the Right to Education; accessing public information through the Right to Information; reservations in education and employment and other facilities for traditionally deprived communities; and justice for our daughters by abolishing unequal practices such as instant triple talaq.  Earlier this summer, the people of India participated in the 17th general election, the largest democratic exercise in human history. For this I must congratulate our voters. They turned up at polling stations in large numbers and with much enthusiasm. They gave expression to their electoral right as well as their electoral responsibility.  Every election marks a new beginning. Every election is the renewal of India’s collective hope and optimism – a hope and optimism that can be compared, I would say, to what we experienced on August 15, 1947. Now it is for all of us, everybody in India, to work together and take our cherished nation to new heights.  In this regard, I am happy to note that the recently concluded session of Parliament saw lengthy and productive sittings of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Many important Bills were passed, in a spirit of cross-party cooperation and constructive debate. I am confident this is only an indicator of what the coming five years have in store. I also urge that this culture percolates to all our legislative assemblies.  Why is this important? It is important not merely because the elected must be equal to the trust placed in them by their electors. It is also important because nation building –a continuous process, of which Independence was a key milestone – requires every institution and every stakeholder to work in tandem, to work in harmony and to work in togetherness. Nation building, at the end of the day, is about creating that optimal partnership between voters and their representatives, between citizens and their government, and between civil society and state.  The state and the government have an important role here, as a facilitator and an enabler. As such, it is critical for our key institutions and the policy makers to study and appreciate the message being sent by citizens and to be responsive to the thoughts and wishes of our people. As the President of India, it is my privilege to travel all over our country, to our diverse states and regions, and meet fellow Indians from all walks of life. Indians can be very different in their tastes and habits, but Indians share the same dreams. Before 1947, the dreams were for a free India. Today, the dreams are for accelerated development; for effective and transparent governance; and yet for a smaller footprint of government in our everyday lives.  Fulfilling these dreams is essential. Any reading of the mandate of the people would make their aspirations clear. And while the government inevitably has its part to play, I would argue that the greater opportunity and ability lies in the skill, talent, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship of 1.3 billion Indians. These attributes are not new. They have kept India going and have nurtured our civilisation for thousands of years. There have been times in our long history when our people encountered hardships and challenges. Even on such occasions, our society proved to be resilient; common families showed uncommon courage; and so many determined individuals found the strength to survive and to thrive. Today, given a facilitative and enabling environment by the government, we can only imagine what our people can achieve.  The government can build financial infrastructure in the form of a transparent, inclusive banking system, an online-friendly tax system and easier access to capital for legitimate entrepreneurs. The government can build physical infrastructure in the form of housing for the poorest of the poor, and availability of energy, toilets and water in every home. The government can build institutional infrastructure to address the paradox of floods and calamities in some parts of the country, and water scarcity in other parts. The government can build connectivity infrastructure in the form of wider, better highways and safer, faster trains; airports in the interiors of our country, and ports that dot our coasts. And near universal data access that allows common citizens to benefit from Digital India.  The government can build social infrastructure in the form of a comprehensive healthcare programme, and facilities and provisions for the mainstreaming of our Divyang fellow citizens. The government can build legal infrastructure by enacting laws that advance gender equality, as well as by removing obsolete laws to make life easier for our people.  However, what is more crucial is for society and for citizens to use and nurture this infrastructure – for the benefit of themselves and their families, and for the benefit of society and us all.  For example, rural roads and better connectivity have meaning only if farmers use them to reach bigger markets and get better prices for their produce. Fiscal reforms and easier regulations for business have meaning only if our entrepreneurs, whether small start-ups or big industrialists, use these to build honest and imaginative enterprises and create sustainable jobs. Universal availability of toilets and household water have meaning only if they empower the women of India, enhance their dignity and become a catalyst for them to go out into the world and achieve their ambitions. They can achieve their ambitions as they choose: as mothers and homemakers – and as professionals and individuals with their own destiny.  To cherish and safeguard such infrastructure – infrastructure that belongs to each one of us, the people of India – is to secure another aspect of our hard-won freedom. Civic-minded Indians respect and take ownership of such facilities and such infrastructure. And when they do so, they display the same spirit and resolve as the valiant men and women who serve in our Armed Forces and paramilitary and police forces. Whether you guard our nation at the frontiers or check that hand before it throws a stone at a passing train or any other public property – just like that, for the sake of it; or perhaps in anger – in some measure you protect a shared treasure. This is not just a matter of obeying laws; it is of answering to an inner conscience. Fellow citizens,  I have spoken so far of how state and society, government and citizen, must see each other and must cooperate with each other. I would like to turn to how we Indians should see one another – how we should have the same expectations from and regard for fellow citizens as we would expect them to have from and for us. Through the millennia and through the centuries, India has rarely been a judgemental society. Rather, it has had an easy-going, live-and-let-live organising principle. We respect each other’s identity – whether born of region, language or faith; or even the absence of faith. India’s history and destiny, India’s legacy and future, are a function of coexistence and conciliation, of reform and reconciliation – of expanding our hearts and embracing the ideas of others.  This spirit of cooperation is what we bring to our diplomatic endeavours as well, as we gladly share our experiences and our strengths with partner countries in every continent. At home and abroad, in domestic discourse and in foreign policy, let us always be conscious of the magic and uniqueness of India.  We are a young country, a society increasingly defined and shaped by our youth. The energies of our young are being channelized in so many directions – in a quest for excellence from sport to science, from scholarship to soft skills. This is heart-warming. Nevertheless, the greatest gift we can give our young and our coming generations to encourage and institutionalise a culture of curiosity – especially in the classroom. Let us listen to our children – for through them the future whispers to us.  I say this with the confidence and belief that India will never lose its capacity to listen to the feeblest voice; that it will never lose sight of its ancient ideals; that it will forget neither its sense of fairness nor its sense of adventure. We Indians are a people who dare to explore the moon and Mars. We are also a people who persevere to create a loving habitat for three of every four wild tigers on our planet, because it is characteristic of Indianness to empathise with nature and with all living beings.  Over a hundred years ago, the inspirational poet Subramania Bharati gave voice to our freedom movement and its expansive goals in the following lines in Tamil: [I QUOTE] मंदरम् कर्पोम्, विनय तंदरम् कर्पोम् वानय अलप्पोम्, कडल मीनय अलप्पोम् चंदिरअ मण्डलत्तु, इयल कण्डु तेलिवोम् संदि, तेरुपेरुक्कुम् सात्तिरम् कर्पोम् This can be interpreted as: [I QUOTE] We will learn both scripture and science We will explore both heavens and oceans We will unravel the mysteries of the moon And we will sweep our streets clean too Fellow citizens,  May those ideals and may that urge to learn and to listen and to become better, may that curiosity and may that fraternalism, always be with us. May it always bless us, and always bless India.  With that, I once more wish you and your families all the very best on the eve of Independence Day. Thank You Jai Hind!

Odisha: Man booked for triple talaq | Bhubaneswar News - Times of India,"BALASORE: Soro Police on Tuesday registered a case against a man for allegedly giving instant triple talaq to his wife on Monday, the day of Eid al-Adha. Raso Khatun, 22, of Pathana Mohala in Soro town lodged an FIR against her husband, Sahim Khan, for giving her instant divorce even though it is punishable by law now. The matter came to light on Tuesday when the woman approached the district collector and the Balasore SP and submitted written complaints detailing her plight. In her complaint, Raso alleged that she had married Sahim, a businessman of Pathana Mohala, three years ago. Her parents had given Rs 80,000, gold ornaments and furniture as dowry to Sahim at the time of the marriage. Her father, Nasiral Khan of Agarpada village, had spent Rs 8 lakh on the wedding itself. However, the accused demanded more dowry after a few months of marriage, she alleged. “I was not loved and respected by my husband or my in-laws. I could not pay more dowry,” Raso said. She added that Sahim would mentally and physically torture her. Acting on the FIR, police registered a case against Sahim under the relevant law. Another woman, Nilofer Bibi, a 22-year-old resident of Sunadharbasana village under Bhograi police station in Balasore district, on Sunday filed a complaint against her husband, Sheikh Sahir, for giving her instant triple talaq. “We have registered a case under the relevant law and are investigating,” said Jaleswar SDPO, Sudarshan Dash.

Triple talaq should act as a wake-up call | Chennai News - Times of India,"Chennai: The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 is being hailed as a landmark move by the ruling party, but the government passing it by criminalising divorce is unacceptable. The Supreme Court observation that the practice of instant triple talaq violates the constitutional rights of Muslim women had produced the desired result of relieving stress of families, but the penalty clause in the act now shows it is not about rectification of flaws in the Muslim family law. It would only further vitiate strained relations between couples. This should act as a wake-up call for the clergy to introspect what went wrong that led to the present predicament. When the bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha last year, office bearers of the Muslim Personal Law Board had a series of meetings with the leaders of political parties and pressured them to vote in the Rajya Sabha according to the wishes of the Muslim community. This time, this line of action was not followed. And Muslim friendly parties showed their true colours under the pressure of the BJP and for the fear of being accused of playing vote bank politics. It all began with the Shah Banu verdict by the Supreme Court in 1985, the AIMPLB-led by Moulana Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi approached Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and wanted a relief. Rajiv Gandhi passed a law to relieve the Muslim community and pleaded with the board to chart out all the clauses of the Muslim family law, such that it could be codified through a parliamentary act, through which all Muslim family disputes could be resolved. Thirty-four years have elapsed, but no action has been taken. The board believes that the Islamic family law does not warrant any further research. Though they agree that triple talaq in one sitting is not mentioned in the Quran and Hadees and it is a ‘bid’at’(innovation), they still followed it. During the trial of the triple talaq case last year, the Supreme Court judge argued that when such a talaq is not permitted in Islam, why the insistence on legalising it. The board counsel replied that it is because it has been in practice for more than 1,000 years. The judge’s argument exposed the poor knowledge and baseless need to follow tradition. The judge further said that any wrong thing practiced for a long time could not be termed as ‘right’. AIMPLB is yet to codify a model ‘nikahnama’ (marriage), despite pressure from some of its members. Going by this attitude and by the history of the board, the attribution of Moulana Ahmed Bukhari of Delhi Jama Masjid seems to be credible that the top brass of the board lacks the wisdom of a Momin (mominana firasat). This is an irony that AIMPLB, since its inception in 1973 began the campaign for educating Muslim masses about the correct method of pronouncement of talaq only after the BJP started campaigning against it. The views of great scholars like Tahir Mahmood and Faizan Mustafa were rejected just because they don’t conform to the ulema’s viewpoint on this issue. If only they had been accommodated, the board would not have suffered such a humiliation in court. The board should wake up and start codification of Muslim law by accommodating ‘the other’ viewpoints as well. But the major question is whether the government would accept the proposed amendments.

But, just two days before the much-awaited festival, she found herself standing out of her own house, with all her belongings.

Rukhsar’s father, Tasavvur Ahmad, said, “Sultan, my son in-law, had been mistreating my daughter since their marriage. Just two days before Eid, when my daughter asked for just Rs 30 to visit a doctor for her and her daughter's illness, he got agitated. It led to an argument. Soon enough, Sultan’s family also got involved and in front of all of them, Sultan pronounced triple talaq and threw my daughter out.” Hapur circle officer (CO) Rajesh Kumar said, “We have filed an FIR on the basis of Tasavvur’s complaint under Section 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act.” Under Section 4 of the new law, passed by Parliament on July 30, a Muslim man, who pronounces triple talaq, is liable to be punished by imprisonment up to three years, apart from a fine.

In her complaint, Rubina Khatun of Pattamundai town said her husabnd, Abu Sufian Khan, who she had married on February 9, 2018, allegedly gave her divorce by pronouncing ‘talaq’ thrice over phone from Hyderabad. “Acting on the FIR, we are investigating the case,” IIC (Pattamundai police station) Rakesh Tripathy said. “I was shocked when my husband uttered the word ‘talaq’ thrice over phone.

"Sati, child marriage wouldn’t have stopped in absence of law: Arif Mohammad Khan | Nagpur News - Times of India","NAGPUR: The evil customs of ‘Sati’ and child marriage wouldn’t have been eradicated if no law was enacted, said former Union minister Arif Mohammad Khan while speaking at Nagpur University (NU) Convocation Hall on Saturday. The former Lok Sabha MP, who championed the anti-triple talaq movement, equated the two Hindu practices to instant divorce followed by a section of Muslims to emphasize on the need for the legislation passed by Modi government recently. He cited the example of neighbouring countries — Pakistan and Sri Lanka — where triple talaq is banned. Khan said a group of Sri Lankan Islamic seminaries had recommended abolition of triple talaq to their government while Pakistan already did away with it in 1961. “Are we (Indian Muslims) unique? When Pakistan and Sri Lanka have scrapped it, why should we have a problem? There is no need to put a communal label on triple talaq. It is not just for empowerment of Muslim women but for all our sisters. An entire society suffers if its women don’t get respected,” he said. Recalling a triple talaq case from his constituency, Khan said the passage of the Bill in Lok Sabha started proving as a deterrent even before it became a law. “A girl was deserted midday by her husband. The man refused to heed any advice for over a year. Meanwhile, the Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha. A couple of days later, I received a call from the girl saying her husband has agreed to take her back,” Khan said drawing a big applause from students and teachers. “This proves a law is definitely needed. Unless there is a law, social evils like Sati and child arriage would have been difficult to eradicate,” said Khan. He reminded that had All India Muslim Personal Law Board not failed in its duty to fulfil its promise, the government or Supreme Court intervention wouldn’t have been needed. The board had assured to boycott people who continued practising instant divorce among other measures in its affidavit before the Supreme Court. Defending Uniform Civil Code (UCC), Khan said it is mandated by the Constitution. “UCC is mandated by Article 44 while Article 25 guarantees freedom to practice or propagate religion of a person’s choice. There is no mention of citizens in the clause. A group of foreigners staying in India wouldn’t need to change their religion if UCC is implemented,” he said. Speaking on the theme ‘Understanding Secularism’, Khan said India has a 5,000-year-old tradition of practising secularism. “In the West, it was born out of the clash between the state and the church whereas in India, there has been no clash between religion and state. Secularism is ancient way of life. Since it was our way of life, we didn’t have a word to define it then,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

In one of the cases a 26-year-old disabled man gave triple talaq to his 17-year-old wife because she was illiterate and didn’t know how to cook. The matter was immediately taken up with the police where the man remained adamant and pronounced triple talaq again. Later, after counselling by police, he agreed to take his wife back home. The police are carefully dealing with the triple talaq cases by offering counselling to save the marriages. SSP Bareilly Muniraj G has given instructions to SHOs to register an FIR under the newly-enacted Act if the complaint is genuine and there is no possibility of counselling. In the first case, 17-year-old Chand Bi had married Mohammed Rashid, 26, two years ago in Bareilly’s Quila locality. Everything was fine in the first few days. However, Rashid, who is short-tempered, started beating up Chand over trivial issues. He was particularly unhappy with Chand’s style of cooking. On Thursday, Chand failed to give him breakfast on time which made Rashid terribly angry. He allegedly thrashed her again and gave her ‘talaq’. Chand was forced to leave the house. She then contacted police. Thereafter, Chand and Rashid were brought to Mahila police station and offered counselling. The second incident was reported from Shekhupura locality under Sheeshgarh police station where Aksheer, 26, was married to Mustajab Khan five years ago. The couple has a two-year-old son from the marriage. Aksheer, however, was forced to leave her house because of unfulfilled dowry demand. Aksheer had filed a dowry case against her husband and the matter is currently in the court. Aksheer, on Thursday, met SSP Muniraj G and filed a complaint saying that her husband tried to snatch her son at a busy marketplace and gave her ‘talaq’ after the failed attempt. Another case of triple talaq was reported from Sirauli where Gulistan, 35, was married to Mohammed Laek around 11 years ago. The couple has three children. Gulistan was forced to leave the house by Laek in July. She then contacted the police for help. The matter was taken up with the police and Laek was asked to appear for counselling on August 7 where he told the counsellor that he had given talaq to his wife before the law was enacted. He also pronounced talaq at the counselling centre and refused to take her. Gulistan contacted SSP on Thursday and requested to take action against her husband. Muniraj G told TOI, “An FIR would be registered according to the newly-enacted law if counselling does not succeed. We are committed towards safeguarding the right of a woman.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Lucknow: Woman files triple talaq plaint, in-laws slash nose | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: A woman, who was given triple talaq on phone two days ago, was assaulted by her in-laws on Thursday for lodging an FIR against her husband. Her husband’s relatives slashed her nose after which she was rushed to the district hospital and was discharged after treatment late in the night. Saddam of Mehmudabad had married Rukhsana of Khairabad on May 9, 2019, said police.

Wives can’t be protected by jailing husbands: PIL against triple talaq law | Bengaluru News - Times of India,"BENGALURU: A public interest litigation (PIL) challenging a new legislation criminalising the practice of triple talaq claims that protection of wives can’t be achieved by incarcerating their husbands. In his petition, Mohammed Arif Jameel, a social worker and RTI activist, has claimed that the new law has been introduced for a specific class of people based on religious identity and the same causes grave public mischief, which if unchecked may lead to a polarisation and disharmony in society. According to him, Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 gazetted on July 31, 2019 is unconstitutional and has the propensity to deprive Muslim men and women of their fundamental rights enshrined under articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 of the Constitution. A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka, meanwhile, directed the ministry of law and justice to file its objections in four weeks. The next hearing is on September 11. Practice of 1,400 years Petitioner Arif says triple talaq is a practice that dates back about 1,400 years and was legally recognised and enforced till the majority judgment in the Shahyara Bano case by the Supreme Court. He adds that a practice, which was around for about 1,400 years — and 67 years since the Indian Constitution — came to be derecognised by the Bano case judgment did not require the government’s emergent intervention first in the form of an ordinance and thereafter via legislation. Arif says when the uttering of talaq is now without legal sanction post the Bano case verdict as the marriage survives regardless of such an utterance, it’s difficult to imagine why the utterance of meaningless words should attract three years’ sentence. “If the act has no recognition in law only Muslims can’t be penalised for committing the act,” the petitioner said in reference to the term “Muslim husband” in Section 3 of the new Act. Not reasonable The petitioner also claims there is no reasonableness in the new legislation as it seeks to concentrate only on Muslims. “There are statutorily prescribed procedures for divorce in other religions too and non-compliance of those procedures is not a punishable offence for members of the religions. There is no reasonableness or constitutional logic for making the procedural infirmity in effective divorce a punishable offence for members of the Muslim community alone and such legislation can’t withstand the test of Article 14 of the Constitution,” the petitioner said, seeking the court’s intervention.

Ajmer man booked under new talaq law | Ajmer News - Times of India,"AJMER: A week after the Centre passed the triple talaq bill, making it a criminal offence, the state registered the first case under the new Act in Ajmer on Thursday. A 27-year-old Muslim woman, a resident of the Dargah Bazaar area, alleged that her 61-year-old husband divorced her by uttering talaq thrice and forced her out of his house. She has alleged that her husband used to harass her. The complainant, a Sunni Muslim and a native of Jaipur, was married to Salimuddin, a resident of Dhobi Mohalla of the Ajmer’s dargah region, in 2017. The man is a khadim at Ajmer dargah. Though the police initially registered the case under IPC Section 489A (dowry), they sought legal advice and a case under the new law, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights of Marriage) Act, 2019, was filed.The Ajmer dargah police said that they have not yet arrested the husband as they were waiting for procedural guidelines to be followed under the new Act.

MBT questions TRS support to BJP on triple talaq | Hyderabad News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: The Majlis Bachao Tahreek (MBT) questioned Muslim leaders and organisations on TRS party’s support to BJP in Parliament on triple talaq. MBT spokesman Amjedullah Khan alleged that the TRS is trying to hoodwink the Muslims by its politics of deceit like a chameleon by clandestinely supporting Modi’s government in implementing RSS agenda. He added that the actions go against the declared secular objective of TRS on which KCR had secured Muslim minority votes for attaining power in Telangana. “TRS’s support to BJP and Modi government in passing bills on Triple Talaq, NIA, RTI , Article 370 of Jammu & Kashmir which are all RSS agendas shows that TRS has becomes ‘B Team’ of BJP,” alleged Khan. He also demanded a clarification from Muslim leaders and organisation such as United Muslim Forum (UMF), Jamaat-e-Islami, All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) to clarify their stand on TRS’s open support to BJP. “It can be predicted that in coming days, TRS will also support BJP in construction of Ram Mandir over Babri Masjid unlawfully,” he said. “MBT will initiate talks with all secular forces to defeat BJP and its covert ally TRS in Telangana,” he concluded.

 New law against triple talaq faces ground test with Muslim women demanding mechanism for speedy trial | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In September last year, Salma’s husband pronounced instant triple talaq (Talaq-e-Biddat) snapping all ties with her by simply writing three words on a small piece of paper. A resident of Balotra in Barmer, Rajasthan, the woman filed a case against him under the provisions of the triple talaq ordinance promulgated in the same month. The case has been on and now that the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 has come into force, a tearful Salma is hoping for speedy justice as there is no uncertainty over the issue anymore. Her husband was arrested as per the ordinance after she filed an FIR but he is now out on bail. She, on the other hand, is surviving with the support of her brother and is currently living with him and his family. Salma, who is a mother of three children – two sons and one daughter, is fighting the case against all odds. Married for around 23 years, Salma says she is yet to get any maintenance support, custody or meeting rights with her children who are living with their father. Salma is in her forties. Her case is one of the 25 complaints that have been received by voluntary organisation Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan since the government first brought an ordinance to implement the Supreme Court judgement of 2017 that declared instant talaq as invalid. BMMA also led the fight as one of the petitioners along with women survivors in the Supreme Court in the triple talaq case. Zakia Soman from BMMA said that based on the reports coming from the ground they are yet to see a case where a husband has been sentenced for any period of imprisonment for illegal talaq. Soman said that to implement the law which is a powerful tool for the victims of this practice there has to be a greater focus on justice delivery to women. To give voice to the concerns of women who are survivors of instant talaq but whose cases pre-date the September ordinance which was re-promulgated in January this year and is now replaced by the new law, Soman said that BMMA was planning to reach out to Central government. The women’s organisation is planing to approach law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and the ministries of minority affairs and women and child development to seek some sort of a mechanism wherein these women get support and can be linked to some practical livelihood options. Soman pointed out that it must be recognised that it has been a very difficult journey for those women who came out against the community’s will to approach the courts. “There are so many of them still suffering in silence and only when those who have shown courage to come out get justice and support to find their feet, will other women in their position come forward,” Soman added. Under the new law notified on July 31, the pronouncement of instant triple talaq by a Muslim husband either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever shall be void and illegal. The offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years. The husband can be released on bail only if the magistrate, on an application filed by the accused and after hearing the wife is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for granting bail to such person. The law also lays down clauses on maintenance for wife and custody of children. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"After triple talaq &amp; RTI, BJD backs govt on Kashmir | Bhubaneswar News - Times of India","BHUBANESWAR: After helping the government pass the triple talaq, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment and the RTI amendment bills, the BJD on Monday came out in support of the Centre’s resolutions on Jammu & Kashmir. Participating in the debate in Rajya Sabha, BJD’s Prasanna Acharya, Sasmit Patra and Prashanta Nanda said J&K has become an integral part of India in the true sense with the changes made to Article 370. Acharya, who is BJD’s parliamentary party leader in the Rajya Sabha, said, “We always said J&K is an integral part of India. How can that be if the Constitution of India is not implemented there? It became an integral part of India in the true sense today after abrogation of Article 370.” Pledging BJD’s support to the Centre for the move, Acharya said, “Ours is a regional party, but for us the country comes first. The integrity and sovereignty of India come first.” “130 crore Indians are waiting for the day when Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK) will become part of Hindustan. The whole of India will congratulate this government when POK becomes part of Kashmir,” Acharya said, adding, “We are very concerned about the freedom of the people of Kashmir. At the same time, we are forgetting what happened to Kashmiri Pandits.” Patra, the BJD chief whip in RS, also backed the move to revoke the state’s special status, saying, “Article 370 kept Kashmir away from us”. Endorsing the decision to split the state into UTs of J&K and Ladakh, Patra said, “Ladakh is a strategic region. Making it a UT is a step in the right direction. J&K was being used for political opportunism and the decision to make it a UT is extremely important.” On PDP members tearing copies of the Constitution in protest, Patra said, “I feel pained because I saw the Constitution of my country being ripped apart in front of my eyes. It has shocked me and I am sure it shocked the nation as well. If this is the sentiment shown in Rajya Sabha, then it is good that Article 370 is being scrapped. It is good that we are talking about J&K’s reorganisation.” Speaking on similar lines, Nanda said, “By voting for Narendra Modi with a thumping majority, people have voted for abrogation of Article 370.” Then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had also wanted to do it, but he had a fractured mandate, Nanda said. He also questioned what the Congress had done in 70 years. The BJD also supported the J&K Reservation Bill introduced in RS. Acharya and Patra said the Bill was not needed as it would become redundant with the changes to Article 370. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Uniform Civil Code: Triple Talaq, Article 370. Uniform Civil Code next? | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: BJP’s political agenda of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, scrapping Article 370 and adopting a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) has for several decades seemed like a statement of intent that did not have much chance of being translated into reality. Not so now. The reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir is set to sail through Parliament with Rajya Sabha having passed it on Monday. The success came less than a week after the contentious bill to ban instant triple talaq and make it punishable breached the numerical and ideological barrier in RS. Suddenly the possibility of a UCC — though by no means an easy task — does not appear as unachievable. Almost certainly, more aspects of personal laws are likely to be taken up for scrutiny, marking incremental progress towards UCC. The Ayodhya issue is now in its final leg, with the Supreme Court beginning day-to-day hearings on the title suit from Tuesday. Despite its sensitive religious and political overtones, the issue may well be heading for a finale. Passage of the resolution to ratify the presidential order that makes Article 370 a dead letter gives BJP strong traction in a growing constituency which is drawn to its nationalist and Hindutva agenda. It is a big success that helps validates BJP’s political vision that it has presented as an alternative to Nehruvian secularism. The Modi government anticipates that the path ahead in J&K will be very challenging, but is convinced that the political logjam in the state needs radical measures that will serve to attack the “separateness” that Article 35A and Article 370 have bred. Home minister Amit Shah was instrumental in winning over several parties. Many felt the ground had shifted and the public pulse was definitely in favour of abrogating Article 370. Party sources said Shah began his preparations more than a month back as he reached out to party leaders and convinced them about supporting pending legislation. Parties like BJD, TRS, YSRCP and TDP all voted in favour of the J&K Reorganisation Bill that saw BJP succeed in pushing through legislation that seemed a bridge too far not long ago.

" BJP turns further right, signals India’s hard power | India News - Times of India","Having won a bhaari bahumat, the BJP government now assumes sovereign authority to reshape India to its will. The fundamentals are now in question, including ideas of citizenship and federalism. Old rules no longer apply. Removing Art. 370 was a longtime BJP manifesto promise, deemed too drastic to ever be formally implemented. Now, the Modi government has moved to make it real, ending Kashmir’s special status in the Indian Union. The Jana Sangh held Art. 370 and 35A to be unwarranted special favours to J&K, and wanted “one country, one emblem, one Constitution”. In their view, any separateness creates separatism. The Modi government has made headway on two big Hindutva grouses — the right of Muslims to keep their customary family law, and the special status of J&K. By criminalising triple talaq, it has shown it can venture into Muslim personal law. And now, with Article 370, it speaks of integration and uniform citizenship. Put that way, most people have no objection — after all, we are one nation, should we not be governed by the same consistent laws? But look closer, and this is a tussle over what it means to be one nation at all. In the Constitution’s model of plural citizenship, we are united as Indians across all our valid differences. Given that India was a compact between many states and social groups, each with their own circumstances, they tried to do justice to each. Minority communities who worried about being swamped by the numerical advantage of the majority, were given some cultural safeguards — though less than what they had during British rule. The Modi government is not merely different in its method or aggression — its intent is wholly different from previous governments. While they used force as one tool among many for specific political ends, this government is ideologically invested in showing strength. It seeks a hostile acquisition of Kashmir to prove its point about the Union of India subordinating all other allegiances, especially those of a Muslim-majority state. It calculates the costs and benefits differently. Given the acquiescence of other parties (except the few Kashmiri parties, the Congress, DMK, CPM, TMC etc), perhaps the government was right to bargain on the rest of India’s indifference, or even willingness to go for broke in Kashmir. For now, the Centre can exert the full force of the military, administratively and economically integrate Kashmir and ignore its people’s various wills, make a desolation and call it peace. And perhaps win polls in the rest of India. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Minority meet calls for law against lynchings, moots platform to promote amity among different faiths | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: On a day the government made announcements axing the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in Parliament, next door, at the Talkatora indoor stadium a congregation of thousands of Muslim community members gave voice to the demand for the enactment of a stringent law against mob lynching. The “Aman Aur Ekta Sammelan” saw leaders of different faiths vociferously condemn hate crimes in the name of religion or patriotism. The speakers, however, cautiously steered clear of making any public statements on the government’s recently enacted law against instant triple talaq or the Centre’s decision on Kashmir. Organised by minority organisation Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind, the congregation saw participants unanimously vow to fight against the menace of mob-lynching. JUH general secretary Maulana Mahmood Madani shared that it has been decided to establish ‘Jamiat Sadbhawana Manch’ at the district and city level to promote amity and friendship among people of different faiths, caste and creed. In a joint declaration adopted at the meet, it is stated that “various misconceptions and falsehoods tainting Islam with terrorism, radicalism and gender injustice are being spread by forces inimical to the eternal truths of our Islamic faith and heritage. Terrorism in all its forms is condemnable and against the basic tenets of Islam.” Madani said that this sadbhawana manch will be a medium to dispel these misconceptions being spread by “a small section trying to create a majoritarian perception”. Through the declaration, the community sought legislation against mob lynching providing for strict punishment to the perpetrators and police and administrative officials found negligent in fulfilling their duty. “Killing, burning, and elimination of unarmed vulnerable civilians in the name of religion or patriotism and publicising such acts on social media to terrorise the public at large as the most repugnant and abominable acts. It cannot be tolerated in any civilised society. We disown and denounce any such barbarous movements and organisations. We demand effective action against them,” it is stated. Maulana Arshad Madani appealed to the government to ensure a safe environment for the minorities. He warned those trying to create unrest between Hindus and Muslims by saying that “the brotherhood between the two communities is too strong and the foundation of this unity cannot be shaken by anyone.” Besides leaders from the minority community, other faith leaders too participated in the meeting including Swami Chidanand Saraswati Maharaj President of Parmarth Niketan Ashram, Acharya Lokesh Muni, Gyani Ranjeet Singh and Anil Joseph Thomas among others.

"Mother of 10 children given triple talaq over phone, husband booked | Agra News - Times of India","AGRA: After 25 years of marriage, Mubarak Hussain allegedly divorced his wife over phone using the instant triple talaq route in Uttar Pradesh’s Firozabad district on Saturday. The couple has 10 children. Hussain has been booked under the newly-enacted Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. Earlier in the week, President Ram Nath Kovind had given his assent after the bill was passed by the Parliament. The accused was also charged under IPC sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 323 (punishment for voluntary causing hurt). Hussain’s wife Noorjahan, who lives in a rented accommodation in West Glass compound of Linepar police limits, said, “I’m married to Mubarak Hussain for the past 25 years and have 10 children. Three of them are already married. I, currently, live in a rented accommodation along with the children. My husband, who is an alcoholic, often assaults and mentally tortures me. He did not provide any financial assistance. Instead, took away money from me and my elder children who works as a labourer.” Narrating her ordeal, the 42-year-old woman further said, “My husband returned home on Friday night in an inebriated state. He started assaulting me when I asked him about financial aid. Later, he left home and said ‘talaq’ thrice over the phone.” Noorjahan is not educated. Her parents died many years ago. Station house officer of Linepar, Sanjay Singh, said, “The accused husband has been booked. Our team is looking for him. Triple talaq is a non-bailable offence now. Soon, he will be arrested.” In another case of triple talaq on Sunday, a 24-year-old woman filed an FIR against her husband at Agra’s Lohamandi police station, after he divorced his wife through the instant triple talaq.

UP: Man returns to wife after Rajya Sabha enacts triple talaq law | Meerut News - Times of India,"MEERUT: A couple’s marriage was saved from falling apart after one Mohammad Ali, who had allegedly dumped his wife Naseema and was living separately for the past four months, returned to his wife soon after the triple talaq bill was passed in Rajya Sabha. The couple had allegedly separated mainly after wife gave birth to twins and her husband’s family started thrashing her over dowry. “We got married on April 22, 2015. Despite spending Rs 5 lakh on wedding, I was harassed for dowry, especially after I started becoming weak due to cesarean surgery while giving birth to twins. In 2018, I was asked to leave the house until I fulfill the dowry demand. However, in September 2018, I returned to my husband’s house with the assurance that I will not be troubled further,” read the complaint filed by Naseema, who is a resident of Saharanpur, with police. The 33-year-old woman’s husband is a resident of Dehradun. However, on April 20, 2019, she was allegedly thrashed by her husband’s family members over demand for dowry and asked to leave again. For the past four months, she has been living at her parents’ house in Saharanpur. However, Ali came back to her a few days after upper house passed the bill and the President gave his assent to it. Farah Faiz, a Supreme Court lawyer and petitioner for the triple talaq plea who is also looking after Naseema’s case, said, “She even visited the police for action. Her husband was called by the counselling cell but he refused to appear. It was only after the triple talaq bill was passed in Parliament that he decided to return and take his wife home. To protect the accused from any police action against the backdrop of the recent bill, the couple reached a settlement and has agreed to move in together. This is a victory for us because this law basically aims at reducing FIRs and encouraging mutual settlements.” To ensure the safety and respect of the woman at her inlaws’ place, a registered assurance has been given to Naseema to transfer a 750 square feet land to her and her children’s name. The case will be monitored by the family counselling cell for six months to see if any of them were facing problems after moving in together.

Triple talaq on phone: Haryana woman files complaint | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: A 20-year-old woman from Haryana's Nuh district on Thursday night filed a police complaint against her husband of two years after he attempted to divorce her by triple talaq over phone. The case was registered the same day that President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the Triple Talaq bill, making the oral divorce a criminal offence, attracting a jail term of up to three years. The woman, Sajeeda, is illiterate and was married to Salaudin on July 27, 2017. She is the youngest of seven siblings born to a couple in Nuh district. Twenty-two-year-old Salaudin is a taxi driver. Salaudin has been booked under Section 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 and Section 506 of IPC at Nagina police station in Nuh district. Ajayveer Singh Badhana, SHO of Nagina police station, told TOI that an investigation is on and police parties are conducting raids to arrest Salaudin. Triple talaq on phone: Husband threatened to kill womanThey had been troubling her since marriage. All this despite the fact that we had given enough dowry to them after selling half-an-acre of land. Soon after registration of dowry case, my daughter returned home,” Sajeeda’s mother Zaheeda said. Salaudin came to know about the dowry case on Thursday and abused his in-laws on phone. “Meri pati ne meri maa se batcheet ke daruan kaha ki teri ladki ne meri aur mere parivar walon ke khilaaf muqadamma daraj karaya hai islye mein teri ladki ko talaq de raha hoon.

Salaudin even threatened to kill Sajeeda, telling her mother, “Agar mujhe kahin mil gay toh usko jaan se maar doonga.” The woman and her family are in shock but are happy to have registered that case against triple talaq. The family had been working hard to save his sister’s marriage, Abdul said and added they were reluctant to take legal recourse against Salaudin. “We have had a number of panchayats where we accepted whatever Salaudin said against our sister. But uttering talaq over phone, that too through our mother was intolerable. Hence, we motivated Sajeeda to go ahead with a complaint against him,” Abdul said.

"Two days after Parliament passed triple talaq bill, 4 cases lodged in western UP, Dehradun | Agra News - Times of India","MEERUT/AGRA/DEHRADUN: Two days after Parliament passed the Triple Talaq bill prohibiting instant divorce, four cases were on Friday registered under the newly enacted law from Meerut, Hathras and Dehradun. In the first two cases from UP’s Meerut district, FIRs have been registered with Jani and Lisari Gate police under relevant sections of the Muslim Women (Protection for Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. In the first case, complainant Bushra, a resident of Meerut’s Jani area, said that she got married to one Mohsin, a resident of Baghpat, in 2016. “Everything was normal in the first year of marriage but as time passed my husband and in-laws started torturing me for petty things. I have been at the receiving end of their torture for over two years now,” she said, adding that recently her husband even tried to throw their three-month-old daughter in a canal. After her complaint, a case has now been registered under IPC sections 498(A), 307, 323 and 504, and under relevant sections of Muslim Women (Protection for Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, with the Jani police. In the second incident, complainant Nazreen, a resident of Lisari Gate area of Meerut, told police that her husband Salman gave her Triple Talaq over phone. She added that her husband and in-laws were unhappy with her for giving birth to a girl child. They also allegedly tortured her for dowry and threatened her of divorce. Meerut senior superintendent of police Ajay Sahni said, “A case under IPC sections 498(A), 307, 323 and 504, and relevant sections of the Dowry Prohibition Act, and Muslim Women (Protection for Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, has been registered against Salman and his family with the Lisari Gate police. We have started investigations in the case.” A third case of instant “triple talaq” was registered in UP’s Hathras district late on Thursday, after a man allegedly divorced his wife by sending her a text message. Complainant Sama Parveen, 28, told police that her husband Ehsaan Mistri (32) sent her the message on July 15, the day Mistri left their rented house in Hathras where the family was staying since December last year. She added that he even took their sons with him after thrashing her. Subsequently, she approached police on July 27. Police first called the couple for counseling on Thursday but Mistri did not turn up. A case was then registered under IPC sections 498A, 506, section 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and under relevant sections of Muslim Women (Protection for Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. In a fourth case from Uttarakhand’s capital city, the Dehradun police booked a man for allegedly giving triple talaq to his wife in Sahaspur area of the city on Thursday.

 New law on triple talaq challenged in SC and Delhi HC | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The new legislation which makes the practice of instant divorce through 'triple talaq' among Muslims a punishable offence with 3-year imprisonment was challenged in the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court on Friday. The petition in the apex court was moved by a Kerala-based Muslim organisation, while the one in the Delhi high court was filed by an advocate — both alleging that 'The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019' violates the fundamental rights of Muslim husbands. 'Samastha Kerala Jamiathul Ulema', a religious organisation of Sunni Muslim scholars and clerics in Kerala, and the Delhi-based advocate Shahid Ali have claimed that the Act is violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution and is liable to be struck down. Both the petitions were filed a day after President Ram Nath Kovind gave assent to the new legislation. ""The Act has introduced penal legislation, specific to a class of persons based on religious identity. It is causative of grave public mischief, which, if unchecked, may lead to polarization and disharmony in society,"" the plea filed in the apex court said. Claiming itself to be the largest Muslim organization in Kerala in terms of number of followers, the body has submitted that the legislation is class specific to Muslims and the intent behind the Act is not abolition of triple talaq but punishment of Muslim husbands. ""Section 4 imposes a maximum sentence of 3 years imprisonment when a Muslim husband pronounces Triple Talaq. The offence is cognizable and non-bailable as per Section 7,"" the plea said. In the high court, the petition said that the new legislation criminalising the practice of 'triple talaq' among Muslims and making it a non-bailable offence punishable with three years of imprisonment, would shut down all room for compromise between the husband and wife. It said that since triple talaq has been declared as void, the Act of its pronouncement cannot be construed to be a criminal offence or even as a simple wrong or a civil wrong. A high court source said that the petition filed by the advocate is likely to come up for hearing next week. The high court petition has alleged that the intentions of central government are ""mala fide and ultra-vires"" of the Constitution as well as the Supreme Court's judgment, declaring instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as void and illegal. It claimed that there could be misuse of criminalisation of 'triple talaq' as the Act does not provide for a mechanism to ascertain the truthfulness of the allegations of such pronouncement. Similarly, in the plea filed in the apex court, the petitioner has said that if the motive was to protect a Muslim wife in ""an unhappy marriage"", no reasonable person can believe that the means to ensure it is by putting an ""errant husband in jail for three years and create a non-bailable offence for merely saying 'Talaq Talaq Talaq'"". The new law makes 'talaq-e-biddat' or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband void and illegal. It makes it illegal to pronounce talaq three times -- spoken, written or through SMS or WhatsApp or any other electronic chat -- in one sitting. ""Any pronouncement of talaq by a Muslim husband upon his wife, by words, either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever, shall be void and illegal,"" the law says. The petition in the apex court said there are statutorily prescribed procedure for divorce in other religions too and non-compliance of this procedure for divorce is not a punishable offence for members of other religions. ""There is no reasonableness or constitutional logic for making the procedural infirmity in effecting divorce a punishable offence for members of Muslim community alone and such legislation cannot withstand the test of Article 14,"" it said. It said that a ""welfare oriented legislation"" would not purport to criminalise marital discord and moreover, particularise the criminalization only to one community. ""With respect, it is submitted that any such a legislation ought to shock the judicial conscience. The impugned Act is such an endeavour and ought to be struck down for violating Article 21,"" it said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

"Azam Khan: 2,000 universities instead of Taj Mahal would have made Muslims the world’s most educated community | India News - Times of India","Can you tell us what exactly happened in Parliament that led to the furore?The Urdu language has only love, kindness and humanity. I said in Parliament as well that if I have even uttered one word which is remotely unparliamentary, I am willing to resign on the floor of the House. The main problem is that I got elected as a Lok Sabha MP despite all efforts of the local administration to ensure I don’t win. The police resorted to strong arm tactics in Muslim areas of Rampur that no one was willing to come out and vote during the 2019 elections. There was no voter or polling agent at the polling booths till 11am, you can check the records. It was then that I put out an appeal to come out and vote on social media. It was after this that the DM slapped several cases of code of conduct violation against me. Despite that I won by over a lakh votes. You will be surprised to know that I didn’t lose even a single booth and led in all polling stations in Rampur Lok Sabha constituency. Jauhar university raids: Azam Khan's son detained; 2,500 rare books recoveredYou have made such controversial comments in the past as well. How do you defend this?I run educational institutions for girls and if I am such a serial offender, one would have heard complaints from other places as well. This allegation has been made a particular film actor (Jaya Prada), a political rival who just lost an election against me and enjoys the patronage of Amar Singh. I had simply used a phrase and I don’t mention anybody’s name at rallies, meetings, press conferences or any public gathering. Why do they think I am talking about them? Your son Abdullah was detained and has been booked for forging documents?When we were having our first child, it was a baby girl and we had admitted my wife as the district hospital, Rampur. My wife’s report mentioned sluggish for three consecutive days. Later I got to know that even if sluggish is written once, doctors normally conduct the operation quickly. By the time the doctors took my wife to the labour room, the child had died. I didn’t create a hue and cry over this as I thought people would say you are only criticising now because your own child had to suffer. Abdullah was born in KGMC, Lucknow. When the doctor Asha Harish (she became my sister) handed me the new-born baby, someone shouted ‘Tazeen (my wife) has expired. Rush’ I saw my wife’s body wrapped in a sheet on a stretcher and the doctors desperately trying to revive her before taking her to the operation theatre. My wife was given two injections in the heart. Doctor Asha left the child in my arms and rushed as well. I fainted and was admitted in the hospital while the child suffered injuries. I am grateful to the doctors and KGMC staff for being able to revive my wife later. I gained consciousness the next day and was told that chances of survival for my wife are limited. It was in these conditions that Abdullah was born. We only got to know later that it was KGMC’s duty to inform the civic authorities about the birth of new born babies. The date registered with Rampur civic authorities is different from the one at Lucknow. The KGMC register has all the details. The matter is being heard in the Allahabad High Court. There is no forgery or cheating in the passport. One mistake in the passport won’t make us Dawood or Laden. The passport officer in Bareilly corrected the mistake later. If the Court accepts the earlier date as Abdullah’s actual date of birth, then there will be a re-election. Let’s wait for the court’s decision. This is not a crime. Why are you seen as a divisive figure in UP politics?BJP has lots to gain from me because they cannot break me or make cow down. I have no allegations of being anti-national. They say I am a Pakistani agent, but they wouldn’t know that my elder sister was married in Pakistan. I have not met her family since then. She passed away ten days ago, and I didn’t even pay her a visit. I only read in newspapers that I am a hate monger. What about irregularities in the Mohammad Ali Jauhar University in Rampur run by you?A University that buys 400 bighas of land will fudge documents for four bighas? These allegations are being made by people who have already sold their land. Some of them have a criminal past as well. I have been called a land shark for these four bighas of land. Now I am being called a book thief because I have books of madrasas that shut down 60 years ago. The University anyways doesn’t have any course related to Islam, it’s a modern educational institution. Why will I steal books that are not a part of any syllabus? We want to give education to our children, but it appears that BJP wants to give them a broom in their hands. Did you approve of the SP-BSP alliance?Our party president did an experiment thinking it will yield better results. It didn’t turn out as we expected it to be. “ Wo khatm kar do giley aaj mil kar galey, khair yoon hee sahi hum burey tum bhaley”. There was unanimity in the party that we should put up a strong alliance against the ruling BJP. It is a known fact that Dalits have historically been at the receiving end of every dispensation. Only if the Mughal kings had made universities and education institutions instead of Taj Mahal. There would have been 2,000 universities instead of one Taj Mahal. India would have been the global hub of education and Muslims would have been the most educated community in the world. You have seen Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh from close quarters. How different are they?Netaji and I had to go through a lot of struggle to establish the Samajwadi Party and state governments. He used to say, “ desh bachega to dharm bachega, jab desh hee nahi bachega to dharm kaise bachega”. This helped us get votes from both Hindus and Muslims. Now we are ready for a new struggle under Akhilesh. Where do you see the opposition headed considering they are disjointed?I spent almost two years in jail after the Emergency in 1975 under the MISA. That time people thought I was a criminal like they think today. Today those arrested under MISA are given the same status as freedom fighters. I even get a Loktantra Senani pension. People had almost given up home during Indira Gandhi’s regime but an old man like Jayprakash (JP) gave a clarion call and united the nation. What about the criminalisation of Triple Talaq Bill?People are either not being able to understand it or are not being made to understand this. The Holy Quran has given a procedure for talaq. It’s a personal issue of how you get married and how you want to give talaq. This can be decided in the nikahnama itself how the bride and the groom want to give talaq or not. I wanted to explain the issue in Parliament but was not allowed to speak.

Muslim groups slam TRS on talaq bill stand | Hyderabad News - Times of India,"CHARMINAR: Two days after the controversial Triple Talaq Bill was passed in the Parliament, Muslim groups in Telangana said that they were let down by their most trusted party leaders. Syed Tariq Quadri, president, All India Majlis-e-Inquilab-e-Millat alleged that the TRS party deceived Muslims by lending support to the NDA in banning the Triple Talaq Bill and said that the TRS staging a walkout was only a political gimmick to mislead Muslims. “The TRS has not only duped Muslims but has also shocked us by staging a walkout in the Parliament. Both Asadudding Owaisi and religious coterie should offer apologies to Muslims for their utter failure,” said Quadri, adding that Telangana Home Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali’s role in the episode was baffling. Quadri also questioned the BJP’s move in selectively passing a legislation on triple talaq, while ignoring the orders of the Supreme Court on mob lynching. “Perhaps, the government’s intention is to provide security and safety to Muslim women either by lynching Muslim men or sending them to jail,” he pointed out. Moulana Syed Gulam Samdani Ali Quadri, chairman, Seerat-un-Nabi Academy, announced that he would move the apex court against the passage of the bill. Taking strong exception to MPs who were absent from the House, it was decided to keep them at bay in the future. Speaking on the walkout staged by the TRS MPs, Moulana said the TRS party has exposed its actual stand on Muslim welfare. “Muslims are deeply hurt by TRS’ stand in the House and we will ensure that they lose the elections next time,” added the Seerat-un-Nabi Academy chairman. Muslims were also asked to resolve domestic issues amicably in mosques or at Muslim counselling centres. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Triple Talaq Bill: AIADMK played a drama in Parliament, Stalin says | Chennai News - Times of India","CHENNAI: DMK president M K Stalin on Thursday accused AIADMK of playing a drama on the Triple Talaq Bill which was passed by Parliament and signed by the President. Speaking to Muslim party leaders in Ambur, Stalin said though in AIADMK’s Lok Sabha member Raveendranath Kumar had supported the Triple Talaq Bill, AIADMK leaders later had said it was slip of tongue on the part of the MP.

But when the voting was taken up, the party MPs walked out of the House and the bill won only five votes. Deliberately the AIADMK MPs walked out only to help the government,"" said Stalin.

Triple Talaq Bill: Four features of triple talaq law that everyone concerned must know | India News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: So, now, triple talaq is a punishable criminal offence. The central law came into effect on Wednesday, with the Union ministry of law and justice notifying it after the Presidential assent. From arrest and bail to custody of children, the law is heavily loaded in favour of Muslim women who ‘suffer’ talaq. There are at least four salient features in the law that a Muslim man or woman concerned should be aware of. One: Since it is a cognizable offence carrying imprisonment up to three years, arrest of the man, who pronounces talaq, is imminent. In case he moves court for release on bail, the magistrate cannot take a decision after hearing merely the jurisdictional police. Section 7(c) of The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 clearly mentions that the magistrate should hear the ‘married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced.’ He shall grant bail only if he is satisfied that there are ‘reasonable grounds’ to grant the husband bail. While in every IPC case the complainant has a right to participate in bail and trial proceedings as an intervener by filing a separate petition (besides the one filed by the investigating police), when it comes to in this talaq law, hearing the Muslim wife is a mandatory requirement for a court hearing the bail plea of the husband. Two: The talaq offence is a compoundable one, which means the complainant-wife has powers under the law to drop her charges and let the husband go on her terms. Section 7(b) of the Act says the case could be closed at the instance of the wife. “An offence punishable under this Act shall be compoundable at the instance of the married Muslim woman upon whom talaq is pronounced,” the Act said. It, however, leaves the final decision to the magistrate who can lay down requisite terms and conditions. Three: The Muslim woman is entitled to the custody of the minor children in the event of pronouncement of talaq by her husband, the Act says adding that she is entitled to claim subsistence allowance for her as well as her dependent children. The quantum, of course, will be decided by the court hearing the case. While she gets the automatic custody of minor children, she is entitled to claim subsistence allowance for all her ‘dependent children’, and not just the minor children alone. Four: Perhaps to make things easy for the married Muslim woman who suffers talaq, the Act says the magistrate in the area where the woman lives will have jurisdiction to hear the case. In most matrimonial disputes, a court’s location often has big impact on the result, as women litigants would find it difficult to pursue the litigation if court is not in the vicinity of her residence.

 President gives assent to Triple Talaq Bill | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind has given assent to the Triple Talaq Bill passed by Parliament, turning it into a law which makes the practice of instant divorce among Muslims a punishable offence, a government notification said. The gazette notification, published on Wednesday, says the president has given assent to the bill passed by Parliament. The Act will replace an ordinance promulgated on February 21 this year to the same effect. The new law — The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 — makes talaq-e-biddat or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband void and illegal. It makes it illegal to pronounce talaq three times in spoken, written or through SMS or WhatsApp or any other electronic chat in one sitting. ""Any pronouncement of talaq by a Muslim husband upon his wife, by words, either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever, shall be void and illegal,"" the law says. Any Muslim husband who pronounces the illegal form of talaq upon his wife shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine, it says. The bill was passed by Rajya Sabha with 99 votes in favour and 84 against, as the ruling NDA, which lacks majority in the upper house, was helped by the absence of some members of the opposition Congress, SP and BSP as well as six members of Telangana Rashtra Samithi and two MPs of YSR-Congress. The Triple Talaq Bill could not make it through the upper house earlier this year during the first term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, although it was passed by Lok Sabha. The bill was again passed by Lok Sabha last week amid a walkout by several opposition parties including the Congress and the Trinamool Congress. The opposition parties had said in its current form, the proposed law could be misused to harass Muslims and wanted it to be reviewed by a parliamentary committee. Criminalising the offence, the bill gives a police officer powers to arrest the offender without requiring a warrant, they had said. To check misuse of cognisable nature of the offence, the bill makes declaration of talaq-e-biddat only if the complaint is filed by the aggrieved woman or any of her relation by blood or marriage, the Act says. A magistrate can grant bail only after hearing the aggrieved woman, it says. The aggrieved woman is entitled to demand a maintenance for her and her dependent children under the Act. Opposing the bill, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad had said a law should not be made to ""finish one particular religion"" and claimed that the ""cat has come out of the bag"". He said the government should not target one section by framing an ""unconstitutional"" law but instead provide 33 per cent reservation to women in legislatures for their empowerment, the way Congress government had brought in reservation for women in panchayats, corporations and local bodies.

 Arun Jaitley: Talaq law will have a strong deterrent effect | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Congress has not shied from amending several personal laws, but has been scared of reforms when it comes to the Shariat and will prioritise the fundamentalist vote bank over gender justice for Muslim women, senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley has said. Writing a blog on Parliament passing the bill to ban and punish triple talaq, Jaitley said the law would have a strong deterrent effect and errant Muslim men will ""think hundred times before using it (triple talaq) due to the onerous consequences of their illegality"" .  Jaitley said the legislation had thoroughly exposed many who professed to be 'liberals'. ""A 'liberal' should ordinarily be hostile to the idea of discrimination... not one spoke in favour of the bill which ends injustice. They raised weak arguments so that the fundamentalists among the Muslims are kept happy,"" he added. The veteran leader said dowry, bigamy or polygamy, indulging in cruel behaviour, were all criminal offences. ""A bounced cheque or a defamation may be a civil wrong but both have penal consequences. Merely to oppose a progressive legislation, one does not have to invent a new jurisprudence,"" he said.  Saying that the concept of social security did not exist in India, he said divorced women risked being reduced to destitution. ""In a divorce proceeding, no person can take advantage of his own wrong,"" he said, adding that there had been reforms in other religions such as changes in divorce laws among Christians.  Unlike in the West where a huge amount of alimony or maintenance is paid, in India sharing of assets was extremely rare, maintenance levels were very low and post a divorce, unless she was employed, the wife was driven to either dependency or destitution, he said.

Aligarh chief cleric opposes triple talaq bill | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: Though the Rajya Sabha has passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 that seeks to ban the practice of triple talaq by making it a criminal offence, Aligarh’s chief cleric has strongly opposed it and dubbed it “illegal”. Talking to TOI, chief cleric Mohammad Hameed said that this is a shariat issue, which has no connection with law. “Every religion has its own personal law and they take decisions on is basis,” said Hameed, adding that neither government nor law agencies should interfere in it. Rather than calling triple talaq an offence, the government’s definition making a law against instant talaq is illegal. AMU’s Imam and religious speaker, Maulana Tasleem Rabani, said that this was the wrong decision and the governmental taken it without discussing it with the community leaders. He said, “why has the government criminalised instant triple talaq even when the Supreme Court has ruled the practice of talaq e-biddat unconstitutional”. Another AMU faculty member and former chairman of Sunni Theology department, Mufti Zahid Ali Khan said that criminalising triple talaq is not a solution and it will not give any benefit to the society. He added that instead the government should have invited option makers and religious leaders from the community to discuss how to end such evils. However, Muslim women have welcomed the bill and are hopeful to witness a decline in the number of such cases. “It is a big support to women,” social activist Mehrunisa said, adding that now Muslim women can oppose their exploitation.

They protested over the ruling party not paying heed to the opposition's demand that the bill be referred to a select committee. In Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad rose to object to the manner in which the BJP listed the triple talaq bill on Monday night for consideration on Tuesday. He said this left the opposition with no time to issue whips to members to stay present and muster the numbers to counter the bill. He also placed on record that the opposition was caught off guard also because on the day the RTI bill was being discussed amidst a lot of opposition, the opposition parties were called to the Chairman Rajya Sabha's chamber where the ruling party was represented by leader of house Thawarchand Gehlot and parliamentary affairs minister. ""The ruling party gave us a list of 23 bills and asked us which bills the opposition party wanted referred to the select committees. We listed 6 in A category and two in B. This implied that those in A category must go to a select committee. The bill on triple talaq and the UAPA were the top two on that list. No one from the government reverted back on the status of our request and we assumed that the government would inform us but then all of a sudden the triple talaq bill was listed leaving us with no time to get all opposition parties together.

Azad was joined by Anand Sharma both inside and outside the House in decrying the manner in which the bill was passed and cautioned that even UAPA has been listed for consideration on Wednesday.

 Triple Talaq Bill: Decisive turn in BJP's battle against 'appeasement' politics | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Parliament's nod to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, criminalising instant talaq, marks a decisive turn in BJP's political battle against what it dubbed ""appeasement"" politics, which will amplify its domination and help reassure its base. BJP has consistently opposed triple talaq and other controversial features of Muslim personal law, including polygamy, on the ground that they were in conflict with the law of the land and as part of its larger pitch for Uniform Civil Code. Although the campaign against the politics of vote bank fetched it good returns at the hustings, it was unable to deliver on its manifesto promises because of lack of numbers and the support that Muslim resistance would receive from other political parties, including its allies. Quick Edit: With BJP having its way in Rajya Sabha too, the opposition needs to rework its strategiesThat changed on Tuesday evening with a victory that will boost the spirits of the cadre, and reassure those who looked uncomfortable with the new thrust on winning the ""vishwas"" of all and induction of outsiders of diverse stripes in the aftermath of Modi's landslide win in the Lok Sabha polls. Rajya Sabha Talaq battle: Ideological dilemma for Congress as 'secular' bloc wiltsBJP may have lately framed the issue of punishment for those persisting with instant oral talaq as one of gender justice, but the cadre continue to see it through the prism of their fight against what saffron circles call the ""Muslim veto"". To them, the success on the floor of Rajya Sabha represents a ""foot-in-the-door"" moment; a prelude to the enactment of Uniform Civil Code and abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution which guarantee ""special status"" to J&K. The manner of victory was equally important. The margin of 99 to 84 would suggest a closer conflict. However, it was an easy win, with ""opponents"" like AIADMK, JD(U), BSP and TRS choosing not to follow through their aggressive attack by voting against it.

 Rajya Sabha Talaq battle: Ideological dilemma for Congress as 'secular' bloc wilts | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The signs of the opposition wilting were evident last week when the contentious bill to amend the RTI Act was passed in Rajya Sabha where the anti-BJP camp held the upper hand for last five years. But the passage of triple talaq legislation takes the issue beyond technicality of numerical superiority into the realm of ideological challenge to the ""secular"" bloc in the times of strengthening saffron-hold. There are signs that the massive BJP victory in 2019 polls has shifted the ground from under the ""secular"", interchangeable with anti-BJP, politics. It was a collection of regional parties - JD(U), TRS, RJD, TDP, NCP, SP and BSP - which joined hands with Congress and the Left to keep the bill at bay for over two years. In big win, government swings Rajya Sabha vote to clear triple talaq billAs BJP under Narendra Modi marched from strength to strength between 2014-19, there were suggestions in Congress that the party relent on issues that the saffron camp has managed to stigmatise with its ""appeasement"" slur. It was during this phase that Congress chief Rahul Gandhi came up with the ""temple run"" idea. The Supreme Court verdict outlawing instant divorce (triple talaq) was said to have given a safe exit route to reset the party compass. But Congress stuck to its guns - pointing to the ""criminalisation"" clause in the bill despite the government making crucial concessions - as much because of the pressure from a strong section within as owing to the persuasion of these regional outfits. Passage of Triple Talaq Bill true testimony to Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas: Smriti IraniAs it transpired on Tuesday, most of these regional parties did not mind siding with the government, ironically by walking out of the voting and dressing up their support as protest. If none of them bothered with more than a fig leaf, the reason is that they are reconciled to the post-2019 political reality and are willing to make concessions. While SP and BSP may be keen to be on the right side of the Centre in view of enforcement agencies, TRS and JD(U) rule states with minority presence and take pride in their ""secular"" hue. This raises serious fear about Congress being left stranded, with Trinamool for company, its dilemma compounded by the fact that it cannot appear to be siding with BJP on ""divisive"" issues. The Congress predicament was best captured with a senior leader saying, ""Political pragmatism may demand that we drop the ante on issues like lynching, minority interests, human rights and liberal values like RTI. But then what would be difference between Congress and BJP."" However, it is on these very issues that regional fellow travellers broke from Congress on more than one occasion this week. For Congress, the signs are downright ominous. Fighting as it is an existential battle, the principal opposition is up against a relentless Hindutva machine under which polarisation does not flag. If Congress sticks to its traditionally reflexive ideological politics, it ends up exacerbating the process of polarisation. But if it softens, it loses its salience.

 Roller coaster ride of the triple talaq bill | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The journey of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill has been one roller coaster ride as the debate on gender here was intertwined with contentious religious and political issues. It was a struggle that played out in the public domain with the issue of instant triple talaq making headlines since the petition was first filed in Supreme Court in 2016. It started with those who suffered the rough end of this practice where their husbands had pronounced instant talaq (talaq-e-biddat) and left them to fend for themselves. As women organisations stepped in and the Supreme Court sought the views of all stakeholders involved, the issue fast gained political momentum even as Muslim minority organisations including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) consistently spoke against political interference citing this to be a matter of personal law and citing talaq-e-biddat as a practice that was defined as bad in Islam. However, they stopped short of taking a stand on declaring it illegal and that is where the triple talaq debate saw minority organisations in a war of words with women organisations like Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, Bebaak Collective, and many other women organisations that stood up for the rights of the Muslim women. The Supreme Court during the course of the hearing asked various women’ rights bodies, and AIMPLB to give written submissions on the issue of talaq-e- bidat, nikah-halala and polygamy. Women rights organisations like BMMA supported first petitioner Shayara Bano's plea that these practices are unconstitutional. The AIMPLB on the other hand argued that uncodified Muslim personal law is not subject to constitutional judicial review and that these are essential practices of the Islamic religion and protected under Article 25 of the Constitution. When the Supreme Court judgement came in 2017, it was the turning point as the issue fast grew into a political hot potato with the BJP- led NDA government seizing the opportunity to bring in a a law to make the SC judgement implementable. It was seen as a political move to counter the Congress and others opposed to the idea of a law as they suspected the real motive of the ruling dispensation was to rein in the Muslim minority and polarise votebanks. This is when minority organisations stepped up their attack on the government for capitalising on the issue. But at the same time women organisations were also divided over the provisions that were introduced in the bill first approved by the Cabinet and later amended to address concerns raised by various stakeholders. However, the government chose to hold onto the clause that criminalised the offence making it punishable with with three years imprisonment. Many survivors including Shayara Bano and Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan supported the provisions of the bill involving criminalisation with checks like the complaint can be made only by aggrieved woman and her blood relations and bail may be given after the wife is heard by the magistrate. However, the bill’s criminalisation provisions evoked protests from organisations like Bebaak Collective also a petitioner in the SC case. The AIMPLB’s women’s wing too swung into action setting off a signature campaign against the bill’s provisions and holding press conferences citing the bill to be anti-women and anti-Muslim. The bill also went through the pull and push of the legislative process as it was passed in Lok Sabha but could not be introduced in Rajya Sabha. Meanwhile, an ordinance was first brought in in September last year and re-promulgated earlier this year. The bill lapsed once the Lok Sabha elections were declared. The bill was re-introduced by the BJP-led NDA in its second term and now that it has the assent of Parliament, the real test will be in its implementation.

Coming on the heels of the amendments to the RTI Act, the passage of a bill that has marked the ""secular"" faultline in politics was much more significant as it ended two years of trenchant resistance. When Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu called for a division, AIADMK, JD(U), BSP and TRS were not present in the House. There were absentees from Congress, Samajwadi Party, TDP, YSRCP and RJD benches as well which more than made up for the fewer absentees in NDA ranks. The House had an effective strength of 240 after Congress MP Sanjay Sinh quit on Tuesday morning, another incremental blow to the party's spirits. The votes polled added up to 183 with as many as 57 MPs not voting - a clear indicator that the opposition had failed to make it a do-or-die effort. Even in a full House, NDA is just a shade short of majority with BJD's decision to support bills tilting the scales. There were five absentees in Congress and two in the BJP ranks. NCP bigwigs Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel did not attend. The bill's passage means the NDA has laid to rest its troubles in the Upper House.

AIADMK opposing triple talaq bill for votes: Tamilisai Soundararajan | Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Hours after the AIADMK MPs opposed the Triple Talaq Bill in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, BJP state chief Tamilisai Soundararajan criticised the ruling party, saying it was using the bill for “vote bank politics” with the Vellore Lok Sabha election in mind. Though the AIADMK leaders were aware of the objective of the bill, they opposed it for political gains, said the BJP leader. “DMK is using the issue as a vote bank strategy in the Vellore election. I think the AIADMK is taking a similar stand to avoid losing the vote bank. It is wrong,” she said. Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa objected to the bill. But several changes have been made to the bill that would protect the rights and welfare of Muslim women. “If a political party is opposing it, they are doing it for political gains,” she said. “I am not talking to them (AIADMK) daily. But I urge the leaders and the party to extend their support to bill,” she said. A few days ago, the AIADMK’s lone MP P Raveendranath Kumar supported the bill in the Lok Sabha. It created a flutter within the party. But, the party MPs in RS have registered their strong opposition to the bill. It is Interesting that Raveendranath was appointed as one of the members of the election committee for Ambur segment of the Vellore Lok Sabha constituency, which has 3.5 lakh minority votes of the total 14.32 lakh electorate.

 Ravi Shankar Prasad: Why is Shah Bano model being followed in 2019? | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: With the passage of the bill, BJP has been able to signal to its base that it has the will to legislate to change personal laws that have been subject to the secular-communal debate, and can also claim to have stood for gender justice for Muslim women. On previous occasions, NDA's lack of majority in Rajya Sabha has allowed the opposition to stall legislation and even force embarrassing amendments to the President's address. Before the bill's passage, the demand from many opposition MPs to refer the bill to a select committee was rejected by a 100-84 vote. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad argued that the bill was not about religious identity but one that righted a historical wrong. He said the practice of triple talaq was continuing despite the Supreme Court banning it and said laws against dowry and polygamy (among Hindus) carried prison sentences. As per provisions of the bill, a married Muslim woman or a person related to her by blood or marriage can register an FIR if instant talaq is pronounced. While the offence is bailable, this can be granted only after hearing the aggrieved wife. The bill entitles the triple talaq victim to seek subsistence allowance from her husband and also custody of minor children. The four-and-a-half-hour debate underlined the political divide with the opposition accusing BJP of a majoritarian political agenda and interfering with Muslim personal laws. BJP, on its part, attacked the opposition saying it was more concerned about errant Muslim men than empowering women. Prasad reminded it was a Congress government that passed the Hindu Marriage Act in 1955 to make bigamy a punishable offence, Dowry Act in 1961 and asked why the same Congress later rejected the Shah Bano judgment in 1986.

 'Gender justice' vs 'destruction of Muslim families' in debate | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Opposition and treasury benches traded charges when Rajya Sabha took up the triple talaq bill on Tuesday with Congress alleging that the proposed law is aimed at ""destruction of Muslim families"" and the ruling BJP calling it an issue of ""humanity, gender justice and woman empowerment"". As expected, the debate that lasted over four hours turned out to be on 'secular vs communal' lines. Moving the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said it would ensure justice for Muslim women from the reprehensible practice of instant divorce (triple talaq) and ""should not be seen through a political prism"". He said the practice is continuing despite the Supreme Court banning it through its judgement. There were 574 cases (101 of them were reported) even after the government promulgated an ordinance banning the practice, he said. Leader of the opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad alleged that he could see through the BJP's design a year and a half back and it is an effort to finish families of the minority community. ""Na rahe baans, na baje bansooree,"" he said, alleging that the government was going ahead with whatever it wished simply because it's in power. ""This is a politically motivated bill. Husband and wife will hire lawyers against each other; land will be sold in order to pay lawyers. By the time the jail term (of the husband) is over, they'll be bankrupt,"" Azad said. Backing the bill, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the law will liberate over 10 crore Muslim women. ""If we run the country as per the law and Constitution, how is it a threat to secularism? This government wants to formulate a law that is as per constitutional provisions and to end the law of 'mullahs'. I believe this is the first step towards uniform civil law. Subsequently you will see how provisions including Article-370 and 35A would be done away with. There will be one law for everyone, all religions and castes.""

 Woman who filed plea in Supreme Court against Triple Talaq hails passage of Bill | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: On a landmark day for gender justice, Shayara Bano, the woman who filed the writ petition in Supreme Court in after her husband served her instant Triple Talaq in 2016, said the passage of the Bill by Parliament will empower Muslim women and galvanise them to take action against the practice. “The Supreme Court verdict was a big victory for the larger cause but still cases were happening. Now that the law will be in place it will surely instil fear in husbands,” she said. Bano, who faced the brunt of the practice after 15 years of marriage, questioned those who feel making the offence punishable with three years imprisonment would leave the woman a destitute. She asked, “What security does a woman have when she is thrown out of the house after instant Triple Talaq?” Soon after the passage of the bill, Zakia Soman from Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan reacted by calling it a “historic development”. BMMA was one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court in the triple talaq case and has supported the government’s decision all through to make the pronouncement of instant talaq a cognizable offence punishable with three years punishment. “For all these years one of the gaps in our democracy has been the legal discrimination of Muslim women under personal law. Today, this bill has opened new ground. I am not saying justice will happen from tomorrow. A lot of awareness and reform from within the community will have to take place but now the women have the law to support their voice,” Soman said. She reinforced BMMA’s long-standing demand for larger reform in Muslim family law by way of codification. Soman explained that the jail term is a much-needed deterrent but highlighted that there was a need to firm up the justice delivery system as on-ground implementation has been a prime challenge. She shared that since the ordinance came into force last year and was re-promulgated earlier this year, BMMA is yet to see one case where the husband who was arrested for pronouncing instant triple talaq being sentenced with any period of imprisonment. Opposing the provisions of the soon to be enacted law, Bebaak Collective, another rights group that was also one of the petitioners in the triple talaq case stated to condemn the passage of the bill. “First time, a personal law would have a penal provision, it seems. Three years of imprisonment of the husband not only would leave the aggrieved complainant at the mercy of their matrimonial family who is most probable to turn hostile and vengeful towards the wife for putting him behind the bars, but also the financial and social liberty of the woman would be compromised!” the statement reads.

The board maintained its stand of using its constitutional rights to oppose the passed bill in the Supreme Court (SC). The board, which is the umbrella organisation of all Islamic sects, said that the ""Modi government passed the bill in both the lower and upper house despite Muslim women's opposition to it."" Board's general secretary, Maulana Wali Rahmani, said that AIMPLB condemns the central government's action on behalf of millions of women. Also slamming the opposition, Rahmani said that ""they have all shown their true colours."" In an official statement, Rahmani said, ""We strongly condemn the Congress party, Janta Dal, BSP, AIDMK, Telangana Rashtriya Samithi (TRS) and YSR Congress party. They supported the BJP's political agenda and walked out at the voting time in Rajya Sabha. They have all shown their true colours."" The board's stand on instant triple talaq has been uniform in the past several months clearing that the board considers the practice un-Quranic and un-Islamic and as anti-women. It had also cleared that the Supreme Court's (SC) ruling on such a divorce being invalid was accepted by the board but had been objecting the government's proposal to criminalize an ""invalid"" practice. The board maintained its stand of opposing the bill passed in Parliament on Tuesday, in the apex court of Justice. The board had also formed a committee in December 2018, through which it said meetings with legislators of various parties except BJP will be approached to make them understand legal fallacies of the instant triple talaq ordinance and how it affects women and their families.

She said by phone, ""Abolition of Talaq E' Bidah is a turning point in history for our women. It was appalling to see the ulema promote triple talaq which is a practice disliked by Allah Almighty. Muslim women were afraid to approach the police if their husbands were cruel to them because they were threatened with instant divorce. Today the sword that hung over their heads has gone.""

The balance of the scales had to tilt in our favour one day. Ordinary Muslim women have waged a prolonged struggle for legal protection of their marital rights. This law offers massive psychological support. This so-called fear that errant men will fail to pay maintenance if they receive a jail term under the new law is deliberate misinformation spread by the ulema. The violation of other communities' personal laws on polygamy, failure to give maintenance and child marriage invite criminal punishment, so why not this."" On the other hand, the Jamiat Ulema E' Hind and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) had waged strong opposition against the Bill in the law courts.

 How triple talaq bill cleared the Rajya Sabha hurdle | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In a major success for the Modi government, Parliament on Tuesday approved a bill that makes instant triple talaq among Muslims a criminal offence after the contentious legislation was passed by Rajya Sabha following support from BJD and walkout by NDA allies JD(U) and AIADMK. Lok Sabha had passed the Bill last week and once granted assent by the President, the practice of Muslim men instantly divorcing their wives by uttering 'talaq' thrice will become a criminal offence, punishable by jail term of up to three years. Here's how the landmark bill introduced by Modi government cleared the Rajya Sabha hurdle: The bill was passed with 99 members supporting the legislation and 84 members voting against it in the final division of votes. The Rajya Sabha had earlier rejected an opposition-sponsored motion to send the bill to a Rajya Sabha Select Committee with 100 votes against it as compared to 84 in favour. The ruling NDA has 107 members in the 242-member Rajya Sabha, which is short of the majority mark. However, walkout by allies and several parties abstaining from voting helped ensure smooth passage of the bill. The same strategy had helped the government push through the contentious amendment to the Right To Information (RTI) Act last week despite lacking numbers in the Upper House. While the non-aligned BJD supported the legislation, BJP allies JD(U) and AIADMK staged a walk out, lowering the majority mark which normally stands at 121. JD(U) and AIADMK have 11 and 6 members respectively. The NDA was also strengthened by absentees in the opposition ranks. Nearly 20 opposition MPs, including five each from the Congress and the Samajwadi Party, were not present in Rajya Sabha during voting on the contentious triple talaq bill, sources said. The Congress MPs in the upper house may now have to give an explanation to the party as it had issued a whip to ensure the presence of all its members during voting on the bill.

""The Triple Talaq Bill passed in Rajya Sabha today is historic and will help Muslim women, who used to be thrown out of their house overnight by just repeating talaq three times without any support and sometimes without children. This is going to give gender equality to Muslim women. It will be a deterrent as men will think twice before they take such steps,"" Sharma said. Under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, divorcing through instant Triple Talaq will be illegal, void and would attract a jail term of three years for the husband. While the bill makes Triple Talaq a ""non-bailable"" offence, an accused can approach a magistrate before trial to seek bail. In a non-bailable offence, bail cannot be granted by police at the police station itself. The bill could not make it through the upper house earlier this year, although it was passed by Lok Sabha. It was again passed by Lok Sabha last week amid a walkout by several opposition parties including the Congress and the Trinamool Congress. The opposition parties say in its current form, the proposed law could be misused to harass Muslims and wanted it to be reviewed by a parliamentary committee.

Triple Talaq Bill:   Bill criminalising instant triple talaq passed in Parliament | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Parliament on Tuesday approved the bill that makes instant triple talaq a criminal offence, after the contentious legislation was passed by Rajya Sabha following non-aligned BJD extending support and NDA constituents JD(U) and AIADMK walking out. Lok Sabha had passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill last week and with Rajya Sabha now approving it, the practice of instant divorce by Muslim men will be punishable by jail term of up to three years. The Upper House passed the bill by 99 votes in favour and 84 against it. It earlier rejected an opposition sponsored motion to send the bill to a Rajya Sabha Select Committee with 100 votes against it as compared to 84 in favour. While BJD supported the legislation, JD-U and AIADMK walked out, lowering the majority mark which normally stands at 121. The ruling NDA has 107 members in the 242-member Rajya Sabha. The NDA was also helped by the absence of some members of SP and BSP as well as those of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and YSR-Congress. The same strategy had helped the government push through the contentious amendment to the Right To Information (RTI) Act last week despite lacking numbers in the Upper House. Once granted assent by the President, the bill will replace an ordinance promulgated last on February 21 to the same effect as the bill. Replying to a four-and-half-hour debate on the Bill, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cited jail provisions in the legislations that ban dowry and multiple marriages by Hindu men to justify the three-year jail term for Muslim men practices triple talaq. To Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, who termed the bill as a politically motivated move to destroy Muslim households with domestic fights, the minister said the Congress leader should think of why his party could never win majority following the peak of 400-plus seats it won in 1984. He saw the 1986 Shah Bano case, where the Congress did not stick its neck out to support women rights, as the main reason for the downfall of the party. The law, he said, was not being brought due to the Supreme Court ruling of 2017 declaring talaq-e-biddat, commonly referred to as instant triple talaq, unconstitutional. ""I am a minister of Narendra Modi government and not Rajiv Gandhi government,"" he said citing the Shah Bano case of 1986. He said he cannot leave in lurch women who have been divorced by triple talaq via WhatsApp or other such means. When Muslim world is trying to reform, why can't a democracy do the same, he said. Trying to shed anti-Muslim image, he said his party gave the nation a President from the same community. On opposition charge of targeting Muslims, he said BJP may be getting a little less votes from the community but it considers them very much a part of the country and works on the principle of 'sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas'. Prasad said the bill should not be seen through a political prism as it is a matter of humanity, woman empowerment and gender equality. ""More than 20 Islamic nations have regulated triple talaq,"" he said. Azad said the opposition has been forced to vote against the bill after the government did not accept their demand to send it to a select committee and make triple talaq a civil offence. The Triple Talaq bill could not make it through the Upper House earlier this year during the first term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, although it was passed by Lok Sabha. The Bill was again passed by the Lok Sabha last week amid a walkout by several opposition parties including the Congress and the Trinamool Congress.

 Triple Talaq Bill's sole aim to destroy Muslim families: Ghulam Nabi Azad | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad on Tuesday hit out at the BJP saying the triple talaq bill was ""politically motivated"" and its sole aim was the destruction of Muslim families by making them fight legal cases and go bankrupt. Objecting to the criminal provision leading to imprisonment for three years for Muslim men for instant triple talaq, Azad said it was like sending someone to jail for hurling abuses or making threats in a fit of rage as it is often seen in relationships. ""I request you to send this bill to Select Committee (Rajya Sabha). The Select Committee will discuss it. It will see what needs to be removed from the bill and what had to be retained,"" Azad said. Participating in the debate on 'The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019', the senior Congress leader alleged the real objective behind bringing the Bill was the destruction of Muslim families. He claimed that the objections raised by him earlier have not been addressed by the government, and instead only ""cosmetic surgery"" has been done. Claiming that the proposed legislation was ""politically motivated"", he said it will lead to discord in Muslim families and society, and if the government wants to listen to Supreme Court it should also bring a law on lynching and not resort to selective implementation. Azad said in Islam, marriage is a civil contract and the government is trying to give it a ""criminal face"" through the proposed legislation. Opposing the Bill, he said a law should not be made to ""finish one particular religion"" and claimed that the ""cat has come out of the bag"". He said the government should not target one section by framing an ""unconstitutional"" law but instead provide 33 per cent reservation to women for their empowerment, the way Congress government had earlier brought in reservation for women in panchayats, corporations and local bodies. He sought to know if the government will provide sustenance allowance to women whose husbands would face prison under the provisions of the proposed legislation. ""This bill is politically motivated. This (bill is such that) minorities remain engaged in personal conflict. Husband will hire lawyer against wife and wife will hire lawyer against husband. ""They will sell their land or home to fight the case.... The wife and children will be on the roads and after the husband is released from jail he will commit suicide or become a dacoit or thief or start begging,"" Azad said. Triple Talaq according to Supreme Court is null and void, Azad said, wondering how Muslim men after staying in jail for three years will go home and live peacefully with their wives. Accusing the government of being selective in honouring the Supreme Court order, Azad asked Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad if he would implement all the minority judgements given by the apex court since 1947. Azad accused the government of ""double speak"" and said it is not just Muslim women, but also Hindu, Christian and Jain women who need empowerment.

" Send Triple Talaq Bill to select committee, says opposition in Rajya Sabha | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Opposing the contentious tripletalaq bill, parties like Congress, TMC, SP, AIADMK and DMK on Tuesday demanded in Rajya Sabha that the proposed legislation be sent to select committee for further scrutiny. Most of the opposition members objected to the provision of criminalising instant tripletalaq. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad moved the bill in Rajya Sabha, saying it has been brought to ensure justice for Muslim women and should not be seen through a political prism. Urging members to approve 'The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019', he said the practise of tripletalaq is continuing despite the Supreme Court banning the same through its judgement. The Bill has been passed by Lok Sabha last week. Participating in the debate, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad alleged that the bill is politically motivated and the real objective behind bringing the Bill was destruction of Muslim families. He claimed that the objections raised by him have not been addressed and instead the government has done ""cosmetic surgery"". Azad observed that marriage is a civil contract in Islam and it is being given a criminal face through the proposed legislation. He sought to know if the government will provide sustenance allowance to women whose husbands are lodged in prison for TripleTalaq during the three-year period. The Congress leader claimed that Talaq could be uttered thrice in anger like a curse, and may not be actually executed, and therefore, men cannot be punished for it. TripleTalaq according to Supreme Court is null and void, Azad said, wondering how Muslim men after staying in jail for three years will go home and live peacefully with their wives. Accusing the government of being selective in honouring Supreme Court order, Azad asked law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad if he would implement all the minority judgements given by the apex court since 1947.

Azad also accused the government of ""double speak"" and said empowerment is needed not only for Muslim women but also for Hindu, Christian and Jain women. He demanded that the bill should be sent to a select committee. TMC member Dola Sen raised the same demand. ""Both Houses have passed 16 bills together in the current session and only one has been sent to select committee. Earlier Lok Sabha sent 60 to 70 per cent bills to select or standing committee for scrutiny,"" he said. She said, ""Just because an ordinance (to ban instant tripletalaq) has been brought, it does not mean that it has been scrutinised... We have not become Presidential form of government or dictatorship... till that happens, let's function as Parliamentary democracy."" Talking about women empowerment, she said, ""14 per cent of the members in Parliament are women. Government says it is historic. She demanded that if the government is so keen on women empowerment then it should extend the session by one more day and bring Women's Reservation Bill as it would benefit 60 crore women. Elaborating on why the bill should be sent to select committee, she explained, ""The husband can be jailed for three years under the bill. Will that mean that women would not be allowed to marry for three years. How the maintenance will be paid."" She demanded that the criminality clause in the bill be removed and the bill referred to select committee. SP member Javed Ali Khan made the same demand. He alleged that the the government is having a ""hidden agenda"" in the garb of the bill which was directed to ""score a point"" with its vote bank. He also asked the Law Ministry about the status of the group of minister on women empowerment formed in October 2018 which had to submit its report in three months. He said one of the ministers on the panel had found a mention in the 'Metoo' campaign with allegations that he had exploited women. ""The (then) minister was the man of the match of the Metoo 20-20 match,"" he said. He also said that an act can be categorised as offence in law only when it causes public disorder, but as per experts tripletalaq does not do that. A Navaneethkrishanan (AIADMK) claimed Parliament has ""no legislative competence"" to entertain this bill. He explained that marriage in Muslim law is a civil contract and breach of contract (divorce) cannot be criminalised. He said that when Supreme Court has decided that instant tripletalaq is null and void then it cannot be declared as offence. Strongly opposing the bill, he demanded that the bill be sent to select committee. Echoing similar views, Elamaram Kareem (CPM) said that the Supreme Court has already set aside instant tripletalaq saying it is void and unconstitutional and nowhere the apex court has said that instate tripletalaq needs to be criminalised. He said that this bill is an encroachment on the rights of the people. RJD member Manoj Jha claimed the bill is a ""violent tampering with the Article 14 of the Constitution (equality before law). You want to demonise Muslim men. Don't get the bill passed by managed majority."" Tiruchi Siva (DMK) also alleged that there was a hidden agenda behind the bill and ""one group is being targeted"". He also opposed criminalising the instant tripletalaq and demand that the bill should be referred to select committee. Prasanna Acharya (BJD) supported the bill but opposed the criminalisation of instant tripletalaq. He said that the provision that any blood relation of a women can be complainant, could be misused. Ealier particiating in the debate, Amee Yajnik of Congress said through this bill, the government has thrust women into a criminal magisterial court for settling family matters. Under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, divorcing through instant tripletalaq will be illegal, void and would attract a jail term of three years for the husband. While the bill makes tripletalaq a ""non-bailable"" offence, an accused can approach a magistrate even before trial to seek bail. In a non-bailable offence, bail cannot be granted by police at the police station itself. Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena supported the Bill, terming it ""historic"" and said it will impart strength to Muslim women. ""After this, (Article) 370 will also go, (Article) 35A will also go,"" Raut said, referring to provisions that give special status to Jammu and Kashmir. V Vijayasai Reddy of the YSRCP opposed the Bill. According to him, sending husband to prison for three years is virtually shutting the door for reconciliation. Saroj Pandey of the BJP said that on April 23, 1985, the Supreme Court had given the judgement in favour of Shah Bano, but the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi did not stand with the decision. She said those who oppose TripleTalaq Bill are anti- women. TKS Elangovan of the DMK said he welcomes the Supreme Court order on TripleTalaq but opposes the Bill, terming it ""faulty"". Nazir Ahmad Laway of PDP also opposed the Bill. NCP's Majid Memon said his party is unable to accept the proposed legislation for various reasons. Supporting the Bill, nominated member Swapan Dasgupta said an attempt has been made to address Muslim social reforms through the proposed legislation.

He said after the Supreme Court judgment banning instant triple talaq as many as 574 cases of the illegal practice have come to the notice of the government. He added that after the last ordinance issued by the government criminalising the practice, as many as 101 cases have come to light. ""The judgment has come, but no action on triple talaq has been taken. That is why we have brought this law, because the law is a deterrence,"" he said. Ravi Shankar Prasad said the practice has been banned in more than 20 Islamic countries, but has not happened in secular India due to one or the other reason.

 Triple talaq bill: Govt says don't see it through political prism | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A contentious bill that makes instant triple talaq a criminal offence and provides for a jail term to a Muslim man for the crime, was moved for passage in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, with the Congress opposing the criminal angle in it and the NDA ally JD(U) staging a walkout. Moving the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 in the Upper House, Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the proposed legislation should be not seen through a political prism or vote bank politics, as it aims at ensuring gender dignity, justice and equality. ""This issue should not be seen through a political prism or votebank politics. This is a question of humanity. This is for ensuring justice to women, dignity and empowerment to women and to ensure gender dignity and equality,"" he said. He said more than 20 Islamic countries have regulated triple talaq in various forms. ""India is a secular country, but unfortunately for one reason or the other it could not happen,"" he said. Urging members to approve the bill, Prasad said the practice of triple talaq is continuing despite the Supreme Court banning the same through its judgement. The government had thought that this illegal practice would stop after the apex court judgement banning instant triple talaq but it did not, he said. As many as 574 cases of the illegal practice were reported after the SC judgement and 101 cases have come to light after the last ordinance issued by the government criminalising the practice, he said. The minister further said there are reports of Muslim men giving triple talaq to their wife for serving burnt 'roti', for asking money to buy vegetables and for opposing an obscene video made by husband. ""There is a Supreme Court judgement but it is not been implemented. Therefore we have brought the law. Because law is a deterrence,"" Prasad said. Clearing misgivings of some members about the bill, the Minister said there is a provision that the wife can file FIR or a relation by blood or marriage and a magistrate can give bail to the husband upon hearing the wife. The Bill was passed by Lok Sabha last week. Once passed in the Rajya Sabha and granted assent by the President, the bill will replace an ordinance promulgated last on February 21. The ordinance and the triple talaq bill follow a Supreme Court verdict of 2017 declaring instant triple talaq as unconstitutional. Before the bill was tabled, Congress' T Subbarami Reddy, CPI member Binoy Viswam and Elamaram Kareem and K K Ragesh from the CPI-M moved a statutory resolution disapproving the February 21 ordinance on triple talaq. Participating in the debate, Congress member Amee Yajnik opposed the the criminal angle in the bill. She noted that through this bill, the government thrust the women into a criminal magisterial court to take up a family matter. ""I am not against the bill. I am for women empowerment,"" she said and questioned the government for bringing a law after the Supreme Court verdict on the same saying it is ""illegal to do"". Yajnik said she supports the bill but for the criminalisation angle. She also voiced concern over desertion faced by women belonging to other communities. Cases of women being deserted are seen across communities and not in the Muslim community alone, she said. Bashistha Narain Singh (JD-U) said some social evils are deep rooted and it takes time to uproot them. ""We come here to oppose as well as speak in a favour (of the bill or any subject). But the best part of democracy is that people agree to disagree. Today I disagree (on triple talaq) and tomorrow I may agree...,"" Singh said while staging a walkout. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi (BJP) said the law has been brought to implement the SC verdict more effectively while highlighting steps taken by the Modi government in empowering women. He sought to know why the Congress' position on the bill changed after it was moved in the Rajya Sabha. ""Last time in the Lok Sabha, the Congress supported. The Congress changed its stand when the bill reached the Rajya Sabha. There is time to support the bill. They can think over it,"" he said.

 Triple talaq bill: Key things to know | India News - Times of India,"What is triple talaq?In Islam, there are different forms of talaq or divorce. Ahsan, Hasan and Talaq-e-Biddat (triple or instant talaq). Ahsan and Hasan are revocable, while Biddat or triple talaq— pronouncing divorce in one go by the husband — is irrevocable. Supreme Court judgmentIn 2017, the Supreme Court banned the controversial practice of triple talaq. A five-judge bench ruled that the practice of instant triple talaq is unconstitutional and against the teachings of Islam. The judgment came two years after Shayara Bano from Uttarakhand approached the top court after her husband of 15 years sent her a letter with talaq written thrice and left her. The petition of four other women were tagged along Bano's petition. Back in Rajya Sabha againOn July 25, the Lok Sabha passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 popularly referred to as the Triple Talaq bill. The JD (U), which is part of the NDA alliance walked out of the debate. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, while introducing the bill in Rajya Sabha today said, ""Don't look at this issue through political lenses... This is a matter of gender justice, dignity and equality.” Not the first time in Rajya SabhaFollowing the Supreme Court verdict in 2017, the law ministry moved the bill immediately making it a criminal offence with a three-year jail term. The bill was then passed in the Lok Sabha, however, it did not make it past a united Opposition in Rajya Sabha where the ruling NDA was not in majority. Triple talaq bannedTriple talaq is banned in many Muslim majority countries including Tunisia, Algeria, Malaysia, Jordan, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Brunei, the UAE, Indonesia, Libya, Sudan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Kuwait. India’s neighbours including Bangladesh and Pakistan have also banned triple talaq. Opposition to the billVarious parties including the AIMIM, JD(U) and Congress have opposed the bill in current form. Boneof contentionMost of the Opposition parties have said that the criminality clause inserted in the bill may be used by police and other agencies to specifically target Muslims. The clause provides for three-year-imprisonment and remuneration from the man who gives triple talaq to his wife. The government, however, dismissed the opposition and asked parties opposing the bill to look at it as one that seeks to empower and protect the rights of women. How the numbers stack upTotal strength: 245NDA: 113 This includes JD(U) -6, Shiv Sena (3), Akali Dal (3), AIADMK (11) and BJP (78). Independent and nominated members have 12 members. This is assuming independents and the nominated members will vote in favour of the government. There are four vacant seats in the Upper House, so the majority mark falls to 121. This implies that the NDA will need just eight more votes to get the bill passed. Support from BJD (7) could help the NDA cross the halfway mark. Now, if one assumes that the AIADMK (11) and TRS (6) walkout and the JD (U) abstains from voting, the majority drops down to 109. The BJD and other fence sitters YSR Congress could turn the table in favour for the NDA. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

That was the reason the lone AIADMK MP Raveendranath Kumar voted for the bill. This is a condemnable one”, he said.

He alleged that despite the assurance given by the state minister CV Shanmugam, ONGC has been continuing its extraction process wherever they have erected exploration wells, he further said.

Edappadi K Palaniswami upset with OPS son for backing bills | Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Lack of cohesion in the AIADMK parliamentary group has been blamed for its lone MP in the lower house strongly backing the triple talaq bill, ahead of the LS polls in the Muslim-dominant Vellore constituency. The discord was evident last week when the party’s Lok Sabha member P Raveendranath Kumar endorsed the triple talaq bill in totality, going against the party’s stand. The AIADMK has 11 members in the Rajya Sabha. Upset with Raveendranath endorsing some important bills last week in Lok Sabha, certain provisions of which the party has been opposed to for years, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami is believed to have pulled him up for not toeing the party line, sources said. The party will oppose the bills in the Upper House this week, sources added. Defending his stand, Raveendranath told TOI, “My views on triple talaq bill in Parliament are personal. PM Narendra Modi upholds the rights of women in the country.” The AIADMK’s RS MPs are clueless about the recent developments and are awaiting instructions from the party high command. Sources said the party would oppose ‘mildly not vehemently’ certain provisions of the bills in the Upper House. “Dam safety bill will be totally opposed. Criminalization of triple talaq and the contentious five clauses of the motor vehicles bill that encroach the state’s powers will also be opposed,” said a source. On Monday, Raveendranath Kumar did not speak when the Centre introduced the dam safety bill in the lower house, even while arch rival DMK vehemently opposed it. The bill provides for a National Dam Safety Authority taking over the safety of four dams located in Kerala, but owned, operated and maintained by Tamil Nadu. “We don’t know what Raveendranath is up to. He never consults anyone. The CM pulled him up after total endorsement to the bills. Otherwise, he may have even backed the dam safety bill, unaware of the hard-earned court order by Amma (Jayalalithaa) in the Mullaperiyar case in 2014,” said a senior leader seeking anonymity. Raveendranath has posted his endorsement of the crucial bills on social media. A Muslim-delegation representing TN Jama’athul Ulamaa that called on senior minister D Jayakumar at the Secretariat a few days ago was surprised when the latter said the party would reiterate its opposition to certain provisions of triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha.

The bill was passed by the 16th Lok Sabha but could not pass the Rajya Sabha hurdle. The ruling BJP has issued a whip to its MPs, asking them to ensure their presence in the House. The bill, which criminalises instant divorce by Muslim men and seeks jail term for the guilty, was the first draft legislation tabled by the Narendra Modi government in this first session after it took oath of office for a second term in May. Several opposition parties have bitterly opposed it but the government has asserted that the bill is a step towards gender equality and justice. Parties like the Congress, the Trinamool Congress and the DMK have demanded that it be sent to a parliamentary committee for scrutiny. Unlike lower house, where the BJP-led NDA enjoys strong majority, the ruling alliance will face an uphill task in Rajya Sabha where opposition parties have numerical advantage over the treasury benches. Some of the BJP's allies, including the JD(U), have also expressed their reservation about the bill. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"Triple Talaq Bill: Government eyes non-NDA parties, walkouts to clinch triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The government and the opposition are gearing up for a fresh test of will and numbers in Rajya Sabha over the bill to make triple talaq or instant divorce among Muslims punishable, with the ruling side banking on possible abstentions, walkouts and support of a few non-NDA, non-UPA parties. The government has been bolstered by its success in overcoming its ""hoodoo"" in the Rajya Sabha, where a lack of majority has allowed the opposition to repeatedly stall legislation, with the passage of amendments to the Right to Information Bill last week with the help of parties like the BJD, TRS and the YSRCP. But the challenge is steeper for the triple talaq bill with NDA partner   Janata Dal(U) not supporting the bill   and other parties likely to have reservations over a legislation that has drawn the ire of the Muslim clergy and political leaders. Government managers feel that a walkout by JD(U), like it did in Lok Sabha, will serve their purpose. Among parties that backed the RTI amendments, YSRCP has said its two MPs will vote against the bill. BJP floor managers are looking at several scenarios, including walkouts or abstentions by parties like AIADMK and TRS. The parties did not oppose the bill in Lok Sabha, but their numbers were of little consequence. The support of BJD is more likely and could well prove to be the tipping point. The numbers in the House, however, are slowly tilting in favour of the Modi government aided by defections such as four   TDP MPs who recently joined the BJP   . The overall party-wise tally in the upper House has moved towards the ruling alliance. Triple Talaq Bill passed in Lok SabhaThough the triple talaq bill is yet to be listed, it is likely to be taken up this week. The government strategy seems to be to make a determined push for its passage but is willing to face a defeat and state that its commitment to the bill is unchanged. It hopes this will allow it to make a political point to its base that it is determined to reform personal laws and also claim that it stands for gender justice with regard to Muslim women. The NDA's heightened confidence lies with its strength in the current House now being 113, including 12 nominated members and independents who may go with the government during crucial division of votes. If the ruling alliance gets the support of BJD (seven members) and TRS (six), it will be able to cross the halfway mark. Though the majority mark in the actual current strength of the upper House would be 121, it will be reduced to 118 if JD(U) decides not to be present in the House during voting. It will drop further if AIADMK and TRS decide to walk out too. In Video:Lok Sabha passes triple talaq billDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 JD(U) to oppose triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha: Vashishtha Narayan Singh | India News - Times of India,"PATNA: The ruling Janata Dal (United) in Bihar on Sunday asserted that its stand on the triple talaq bill, which it had opposed in the Lok Sabha despite being an NDA partner, ""will be the same"" when the legislation is introduced in the Rajya Sabha. JD(U) Bihar president Vashishtha Narayan Singh, himself a Rajya Sabha member, however, did not clarify as to whether the party - headed by chief minister Nitish Kumar - would stage a walkout or abstain from voting like it had done in the Lower House, or would vote against the bill in Upper House where the NDA is way short of majority. ""This question has been posed to us many times. Our stand on this issue has always been clear. The stand was the same in the past as it is now and will remain so in future,"" Singh said in response to queries from journalists. Last week, when the bill was tabled before the Lok Sabha, the JD(U) had staged a walkout after the party's leader in the House Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan made an impassioned speech about the need for awareness in place of laws to banish retrograde customs. Lalan had also underscored that the bill, which seeks to make instant divorce punishable with three years in prison, could create an atmosphere of suspicion in the country. Singh was addressing a press conference at the party headquarters in Patna to announce the induction of former Union minister Mohammed Ali Ashraf Fatmi who recently quit the RJD following a spat with the party's heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav. ""I have joined the JD(U) as I have full faith in the positive leadership of Nitish Kumar. It was painful for me to leave the RJD. But the party has come to be controlled by coterie. It may be too late before reality dawns on a majority of RJD leaders,"" said Fatmi whose son Faraz is still an RJD MLA. Fatmi, who is one of the founding members of the RJD, had been sore when the Darbhanga Lok Sabha seat - which he had represented four times - was given to another veteran RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui. He had hoped to be considered for Madhubani which is adjacent to Darbhanga, but when the seat went to Mahagathbandhan ally Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), he announced that he would contest as an Independent candidate. He later gave up his plans to enter the fray but Tejashwi Yadav informed him that he has been suspended for six years. Fatmi subsequently quit the party saying the younger son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad had been ""so rude"" to him over telephone. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Practice of instant talaq is offence and cannot be allowed to continue: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi | India News - Times of India,"RAMPUR: Pitching for the passage of the triple talaq bill, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Sunday said that the practice of instant talaq is an offence and cannot be allowed to continue. ""Triple Talaq is an offence which can not be ignored. Many Ismalic countries have already declared it a penal offence,"" he said here. The minister asked the Opposition parties to support the bill in the welfare of Muslim women. He also cautioned the Opposition parties that they may have to pay a heavy political price if they do not support the bill. Referring to Congress' poor performance in the last two Lok Sabha elections, he said: ""We ask Congress and other parties who are opposing the bill to support it (in Rajya Sabha). They are being penalised because of their past mistakes. If they commit the same mistakes, they will be sidelined for centuries."" The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, seeks to criminalize the act of instant divorce among Muslims with a three-year jail sentence for men who practice triple talaq, which has been made illegal by the Supreme Court. It was passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday. Many political parties including Congress, DMK, Samajwadi Party, BJP ally JD(U) and Trinamool Congress staged a walkout in opposition of the bill. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha in December last year but lapsed in the Rajya Sabha after the dissolution of the Lower House. The current bill seeks to replace an ordinance promulgated last February. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"YSRC to vote against triple talaq bill, TDP yet to decide | Vijayawada News - Times of India","VIJAYAWADA: The YSRC is likely to vote against the triple talaq bill, which will be tabled in Rajya Sabha soon. The party voted against the bill in the Lok Sabha and would follow the same course of action. PV Midhun Reddy, YSRC’s floor leader in Lok Sabha, confirmed this to STOI. “We are against criminal punishment mentioned in the bill. Marriage is a civil contract between two people and a breach of contract cannot be seen as a criminal offence,” Midhun Reddy said. He further said that his party is committed to equal justice for everyone and upliftment of women. “Our government in AP has already taken several initiatives for upliftment of women, particularly from SC, ST, BC and minority communities. If the central government works on the same lines, we will welcome it. But this bill is not anywhere close to it,” he added. “When even the Supreme Court has said that marriages are civil contracts in nature, the punishment cannot be criminal if the contract is breached. Hence, as I said in the Lok Sabha, the bill has no relevance,” Midhun Reddy pointed out while expressing fears that the bill might be seen as discrimination by the government. “The bill will send wrong signals to people, particularly minorities.” The AP government has enacted two legislations in the current budget session, guaranteeing 50% quota for BCs, SCs, STs and minorities in nominated posts, state corporations, boards, societies, trusts, agricultural market yards and also in contracts taken up on nomination basis. Of the quota for members of these groups, at least 50% will be reserved for women in nominated posts and contracts. “This will enable Muslim women to overcome their problems, including marital issues, but not the triple talaq bill,” asserted a senior leader from the party. Meanwhile, the TDP is yet to decide on its stand. The party abstained from voting and staged a walkout in the Lok Sabha. “We are opposed to the bill as it asks for a three-year jail term for those giving triple talaqs, which is not correct. In other faiths, there is no such punishment for breaking marriage. Why should it be given to Muslims? It is for this reason we abstained from voting in the Lok Sabha,” said Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas. However, the BJP is confident that TDP MPs in the Rajya Sabha would vote in favour of the bill. A senior BJP leader said TDP MPs voted in favour of the RTI bill in the RS though they abstained from voting in the LS. “We are confident that TDP Rajya Sabha members would do the same in the case of the triple talaq bill too,” a BJP leader said confidently.

"AIADMK does U-turn in triple talaq, motor vehicles bills | Chennai News - Times of India","CHENNAI: The total endorsement to the passage of Triple Talaq and Motor Vehicles Bills by lone AIADMK member and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam’s son, P Ravindranath Kumar in Lok Sabha, has created ripples in the party and drawn flak from the DMK. While former Lok Sabha MP Anwhar Rajhaa opposed the controversial Triple Talaq bill thrice in the Lower House, and termed it ‘barbaric’, Kumar on Thursday said the amendment bill was a commitment of the Union government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give equal power to women in society. “This is not a matter of majority or minority, but it is a matter of humanity, it is a matter of women’s rights… According to this bill, we are providing equal rights to women, subject to caste and religion. If women are given proper opportunities, they will achieve equal or more than men,” Kumar said. The social ritual, he added, should not be forced on them as an impediment for the development. When the Union ministry of law and justice sought the views of the state government on the legislation, the AIADMK government, through its then chief secretary Girija Vaidyanathan in December 2017 had sought omission of the provision relating to punishment with three years’ imprisonment and fine on the pronouncement of Talaq. While Kumar’s assertion set off a debate in the ruling camp, the senior leaders in private confided that the MP’s views could be his own. AIADMK RS floor leader A Navaneethakrishnan said the consistent stand of the party has been to oppose certain provisions of the bills. “We will act as per the instructions of the high command at the time of voting in Rajya Sabha. That is the normal practice from the days of Amma,” the leader said, declining to get into the party’s stand in Rajya Sabha. Amid the party’s intense campaign in Vaniyambadi in the Muslim dominated Vellore Parliamentary constituency on Friday, senior minister D Jayakumar resorted to a damage control. He said former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had taken a clear stand on the bill and the party’s stand was in line with that. “There is no difference of opinion. Our support is that all women should get equal rights. But our leader was of the view that certain provisions of the bill should be amended. That is our stand too,” Jayakumar said, while being careful not to use the word ‘oppose.’ Incidentally, none of the five demands made by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to Prime Minister on the Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill had been acceded to by the Centre. Kumar, however, supported the passage of the bill. While the suggestions of many states were incorporated, the Centre passed the bill without considering Tamil Nadu’s “valid objections”, said a senior leader. The crucial modifications and deletions of five clauses, include collection of fee and taxes by the Centre, delegation of powers to any public servant or public authority, empowering the Centre to come up with a National Transportation Policy for liberalizing the permit system in respect of interstate transportation of goods and passengers, besides registration of vehicles.

Cutting across party lines, Lok Sabha members today condemned Khan's remark and sought action against him. Speaker Om Birla has assured the House that he will take a decision on it shortly. The Samajwadi Party leader's remarks were perceived to be sexist by the treasury benches and triggering strong objection, to which he said that Rama Devi was very respected and was like a sister to her.

JD(U) opposes Triple Talaq Bill in Lok Sabha | Patna News - Times of India,"PATNA: National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partner Janata Dal (United) on Thursday opposed the Triple Talaq Bill which was passed by the Lok Sabha and walked out of it, saying contentious issues should be avoided and the legislation should not be imposed on a particular community. “JD(U) is an ally of NDA and we have been together in the coalition since 1996. Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasadji knows it pretty well. He also knows it very well that we have never supported any contentious issue since 1996 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the PM,” JD (U) MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh said while participating in a debate on The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 moved by Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. Singh said the Bill would cause distrust among a particular community. He added, “National agenda of governance of NDA was made during the regime of Vajpayee and three things are written in it. First, no change on the issue of Article 370; second, Ayodhya dispute should either be sorted out with mutual understanding or through court’s verdict and third, there should not be any tweaking of Common Civil Code.” Emphasizing on creating mass awareness on the issue of triple talaq, Singh said, “You cannot establish the relation between husband and wife by making a law. If you do this, a particular community will develop distrust. Nobody likes talaq but it should be left on the particular community to take a decision on the issue. The government should rather take steps for spreading mass awareness on the issue.” He added, “The society is not only run by constitution, it is also run by customs and traditions. There is a tradition in that particular community and you have to take a historic step to stop it. Thus, there is no need to make this law in haste.” Singh also took a dig at Union minister Giriraj Singh, saying, “Giriraj Babu, I know it well that you have a particular agenda and you keep pursuing it.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"RTI Bill:   BJD, TRS, YSRCP's help gets RTI bill through Rajya Sabha | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: In a significant success, the Modi government beat its Rajya Sabha ""jinx"" on Thursday with the RTI (Amendment) Bill being passed without a division after an anticipated test of numbers petered out with the opposition choosing to walk out after the headcount tilted towards the NDA.   The Lok Sabha had passed the bill   on Monday. Clearing the Upper House hurdle was important for the NDA as its lack of majority led to several bills passed by the Lok Sabha being stalled in the Rajya Sabha during the previous Modi government. The smooth sailing on the contentious RTI vote is a boost ahead of the bill seeking to make triple talaq punishable being brought to the Rajya Sabha even though the legislation will present a sterner test. Passage of the RTI amendments is a political and policy win for the government as the bill drew flak from former information commissioners, transparency activists and the opposition for ""diluting and downgrading"" the Central Information Commission. But the opposition challenge did not materialise with a clutch of regional parties, including BJD, TRS and YSR Congress coming to the government's aid. The Upper House passed the bill by voice vote after an opposition-sponsored motion to send it to a select committee for greater scrutiny was negated. The motion was turned down with 117 members voting against and BJP finally garnering the support of BJD, TRS and YSR Congress. Only 75 members voted in favour of sending the bill to the select committee. With numbers swinging towards the NDA, Congress, Trinamool Congress and DMK staged a walkout alleging ""intimidation"" to manipulate votes. They claimed that TDP's breakaway MP CM Ramesh was seen collecting voting slips from MPs which he should not have done. Through the day, there were sharp exchanges between the ruling party and the opposition with the latter sticking to its demand for sending the bill for further scrutiny and forcing four adjournments. The bill does away with information commissioners being granted equivalence with the chief election commissioner and SC judges. It also gives the government powers to set terms and salaries. On its part, the government argued that the RTI law's provisions as regards its powers remained untouched. The passage of the bill may mean a more favourable pitch for the government for the more challenging Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, commonly known as the triple talaq bill, which was passed by the Lok Sabha on Thursday. Interestingly, BJD supported the bill while JD(U) walked out. This might mean a lower majority threshold in the Rajya Sabha to the government's advantage. The opposition said the proposed changes in the RTI bill would weaken the existing law. In Video:Rajya Sabha passes RTI (Amendment) BillDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Uproar in Lok Sabha over Azam Khan's sexist remark against Chair | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan found himself in the middle of a controversy after his sexist remark directed at BJP's Rama Devi, who was in the presiding officer's chair in the Lok Sabha, set off an uproar with demands that the Rampur MP apologise. Taking part in the debate on the bill to make triple talaq a punishable offence, he referred to the intervention of minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and read out a couplet, ""... tu idhar-udhar ki baat na kar (do not divert from the topic)."" Rama Devi asked Khan not to ""look here and there"" and address the Chair. Khan then made a sexist remark. While BJP MPs protested and sought an apology, Rama Devi directed Khan's remark be removed from the records. She, however, said she was like his (Khan's) sister. Khan's remark infuriated law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and junior parliamentary affairs minister Arjun Meghwal as they urged the chair to ask him to apologise. When Khan was asked to do so by Rama Devi, he said he meant no disrespect to her as she was like his ""dear sister"". Speaker Om Birla asked the MP to apologise. But Khan said he felt humiliated and walked out even as his party chief Akhilesh Yadav tried to pacify him. The House witnessed another round of disorder after Akhilesh, in his attempt to clarify Khan's reference, termed members of the treasury benches ""badtameez (mannerless)"". Later, he said such a term was used against him. On this, the Speaker asked him which member had used the term. Akhilesh did not respond to the question and regretted his reference. The Speaker took objection and reminded him to be mindful of unparliamentary language. As the Speaker listened to both sides, BSP's Danish Ali walked out, saying he was not allowed to speak. Khan joined him, saying he could not speak when he was insulted. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said it was unfortunate if members of the minority community leftwhen the triple talaq bill was being discussed. But the Speaker said the remarks created a poor impression of Parliament.

Parliament approves amendment to RTI Act as Rajya Sabha rejects opposition motion to send bill to select committeeThe clause in the bill which criminalises the practice with a jail term of upto three years for the husband was passed by a division of 302 in favour and 78 against. Parliament session live updatesThe JDU, TMC and Congress MPs staged a walkout from the House in protest against the triple talaq bill. The Congress and other opposition parties demanded the bill be sent to the Standing Committee for review, saying it targets Muslim community of the country. Earlier, moving the bill in the Lok Sabha, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the legislation was a must for gender equality and justice and despite an August 2017 Supreme Court verdict striking down the practice of instant triple talaq, women are being divorced by 'talaq-e-biddat'. He said, since January 2017, as many as 574 triple talaq cases and since the Supreme Court order, more than 300 such cases were reported by the media. Opposing the bill, Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM) said there are nine types of talaqs in Islam. Owaisi asked if the husband is jailed, as the bill proposes, then how will he be able to pay the maintainance to his wife while sitting in the jail. ""You want to destroy the institution of marriage and bring the women on the road,"" he said. Owaisi said when the Supreme Court has banned instant triple talaq then why does the government want to jail Muslim man. Owaisi challenged the government to take all women MPs of BJP in a special aircraft to Sabrimala, if the government is concerned about the rights of women. Gaurav Gogoi (Congress) said the SC had not asked the government to make triple talaq criminial offence. ""If you want to protect Muslim women who are divorced by their husbands, then you should also give protection to Hindu and Parsi women who are deserted by their husbands,"" Gogoi said. A M Ariff (CPM) said he concurred with several members that triple talaq was uncivilised but he did not favour any legislation on the issue as the Supreme Court has already termed it illegal. Poonam Mahajan (BJP) said prevention is better than cure and the proposed legislation is seeking to do the same. She said the bill is not about empowerment of women alone but it is also in consonance with government's motto of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vishwas aur Sabka Vikas'. Meenakashi Lekhi (BJP) said the bill is not the agenda of the BJP, but it is the agenda of the nation. The opposition parties are not able to digest the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, being a Hindu, is thinking for Muslims, Lekhi said. Three ordinances have, so far, been promulgated as a similar bill moved by the previous government could not get the parliamentary nod. A fresh bill was introduced by the new government in June during the ongoing Parliament session. Under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, divorcing through instant triple talaq will be illegal, void and would attract a jail term of three years for the husband.

Participating in the discussion on the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, DMK leader Kanimozhi said she was opposed to the bill. She said the bill would not send a right signal. The government should bring a ""bill to stop honour killing as young men and women have been killed. Everyday there is a report on this. What laws we are bringing to stop that,"" she said. ""We need to bring bill against mob lynching. That is the need of the hour,"" she added.

She said that a BJP member talked about freedom, but the situation currently is that ""we are not allowed what we want to eat"". Describing the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill as ""divisive"" and ""discriminatory"", she said re-promulgation of the law is a ""fraud"". In Rajya Sabha last year, it was stalled because it is against the Constitution.

The Lok Sabha member said domestic violence laws are strong enough to protect Muslim women. She said while the government is supporting the Supreme Court's minority judgement on bringing a law on triple talaq, the government is not supporting an apex court verdict on Sabarimala Temple issue. ""Why the BJP was silent on that and not opposed to it.

 UPA to oppose Triple Talaq Bill in Lok Sabha | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Congress party has spoken to all allies of UPA and all of them have agreed to oppose the Triple Talaq Bill in Lok Sabha today.  Speaking to ANI, Chief Whip of Congress in Lok Sabha K Suresh said the party will ""strongly oppose"" the criminality clause in the Bill.  ""Last night, they put in Triple Talaq Bill in today's agenda and postponed National Medical Commission Bill and DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill without knowledge of opposition. Why are they keeping it a secret and putting it on the agenda at night?""  ""As far as Triple Talaq Bill is concerned, Criminality Clause may be misused by police and government. So, we will strongly oppose the Criminality Clause. If the government sticks to that, we will ask for division,"" he added.  The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, seeks to replace an ordinance by the government in February and to make instant Triple Talaq a penal offence.

Lok Sabha bills: 12 bills passed in 15-year high for 1st session | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jul 24, 2019)NEW DELHI: The first session of 17 thLok Sabha is set to see a government pushing the highest number of Bills in over 15 years. The Parliament has already passed 12 Bills and is likely to consider at least 10 more. Data collated by PRS Legislative and shared exclusively with ET reveals that this is the most number of Bills passed in the first or Budget session of a new Lok Sabha in 15 years. This time, the Modi government has made an exception and clubbed the first session of Parliament (which involves oath taking by elected MPs and Presidential address to joint sitting of both Houses) with the Budget session. Since 14th Lok Sabha in 2004 till the 16th Lok Sabha in 2014, the first session has seen no legislative business. Even the Budget session has seen very few Bills being pushed. In 2004, the Budget session, between July 5 and August 26, saw only six Bills being passed. The Budget session of 15th Lok Sabha, between July 2 and August 7, saw eight Bills being passed. This number increased to 12 in the first Budget session of 16th Lok Sabha, between July 7 and August 14. The current session would obviously see the number increase beyond 12 as it has already passed this number and there are more Bills on the government’s agenda. WHY IS THE OPPOSITION PROTESTINGThe move has come under fire from the Opposition which has demanded improved parliamentary scrutiny. At present, the standing committees are not in place and the new Bills cannot be referred to these committees. The Opposition can only demand Bills be referred to select committee. The Opposition feels that the government is using its overwhelming majority to push legislations, which require closer examination of a standing committee. This is not the first time that the committees are not in place when the Budget session is on. The only time the committees were formed during the Budget session of a new Lok Sabha was in 14th LOk Sabha under Congress-led UPA-I when the committees were formed by August 5. The Budget session ended on August 26. In the 15th LOk Sabha, the Budget session ended on August 7 and the committees were in place only on August 31. Under Modi 1.0, the committees were in place only by September 1, a fortnight after the Budget session ended on August 14. Trinamool Congress’ Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’ Brien said, “How many Bills were passed in these Budget sessions? Hardly any. So there was the option of submitting them to parliamentary scrutiny. But here the government is rushing through Bill after Bill and murdering democracy.” CPI (M) MP K K Ragesh said, “We will not allow Parliament to become Gujarat Assembly.” WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT PUSHING HARD?The government is also under pressure as it had promulgated several Ordinances in February and March 2019. It has to convert at least 10 Ordinances, including the politically sensitive Triple Talaq, into Acts of Parliament within 45 days of beginning of the session else they would lapse. The Ordinances lined up include the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Ordinance, the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Ordinance, New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Ordinance, the Homeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance and Special Economic Zone (Amendment) Ordinance.

" Eyeing passage of key bills, govt keen to extend House session | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI : Looking for early passage of more legislations, the government on Monday remained keen to extend the current session of Parliament by a week despite reservations expressed by the opposition . Sources confirmed that the current session will be extended and a formal decision in this regard will be taken on Tuesday . ""The House will certainly be extended and it will be confirmed by Tuesday,"" a senior functionary said, adding that the length of the extension remained to be worked out.  The assertion came in the face of the opposition's protests in the meeting of the business advisory committee when the government proposed the extension. Sources said representatives of Congress and Trinamool Congress protested against the move on the ground that they had already been away from their constituents long enough and they needed to be back among them. Some in the opposition felt the government's keenness had to do with its anxiety to get legislations passed without having to send them to standing committees whose constitution has been delayed as part of the plan to circumvent Parliament scrutiny.  At least 17 crucial bills, including the triple talaq bill, are awaiting passage and the government plans to get most of them cleared before Parliament takes a break.The National Medical Commission Bill, the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill are among the pending bills.

She was taken to a hospital and has been released after treatment, they added. During the incident, Zainab’s mother-in-law Najjo tried to remove her earrings but she objected to it. “Zainab refused to give away the jewellery as it was given to her by us.

He added that Sabir who sells oil containers to mills,had a strained relationship with his wife ever since their marriage for nine years now. The couple have four children. “Sabir had hit Zainab in the head with a stick around two years back. Her in-laws used to misbehave with her,” Mursaleem said. He added that a few days back, Zainab was unwell and so he had brought her to his home. “She stayed with us for five days and on Friday, when she returned to her in-laws in Dadri, Sabir told her that he wanted a divorce,” Mursaleem said.

Maliwal said that in a civilised society, there was no place for these evil practices. DCW daily comes across several women suffering due to such practices, she added. Social evils such as child marriage, sati, female infanticide, dowry and abandonment by husband have been made illegal by law and have resulted in upliftment of women to a large extent, the letter stated. “Nikah halala is a practice which is nothing but rape of a woman. A woman once divorced by her husband cannot reconcile with him until she marries another man and develops a sexual relationship with him. Even then, first that other man will give her a divorce and only then she can reconcile with her husband. It is physical abuse without consent of the woman.” Often the second man refuses to give divorce, it added. “This is a vicious cycle of torture and trauma for women entailing nothing but physical and mental abuse.” Pleading the government not to provide incomplete justice, Maliwal urged it to add nikah halala and polygamy in the bill introduced in Lok Sabha.

TPCC minorities department chairman Shaik Abdullah Sohail in a statement said the triple talaq bill is an attempt by the BJP government at the Centre to interfere with Muslim personal law. The TRS supported the BJP government by abstaining from voting on triple talaq bill in the Lok Sabha on December 27, 2018. This time too, the TRS decided to keep away from the triple talaq bill debate and voting in Parliament, he alleged. ""TRS should make its stand clear on whether it is in favour of the bill or against it. It cannot simply go into hiding and help the BJP government pass the bill in Parliament. The TRS cannot be both communal and secular at the same time,"" Sohail said. He suggested that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao speak on the issue and direct his MPs to oppose the bill in Parliament. The Congress leader alleged that the BJP government was trying to hurt the sentiments of the Muslim community by raising muslim personal law issues such as triple talaq. The BJP is trying to brand all Muslims as suppressors of women's rights. “Divorce is a social problem and it cannot be linked with religion. As per Census 2011, there were 13,62,316 divorcees in India and nearly 70.67% are Hindus and 19.79% are Muslims. Of the 2,69,609 Muslim divorcees, as many as 2,12,074 are women,” he said. Sohail sought to ask BJP leaders to give the exact numbers or approximate percentage of cases of triple talaq among the 2.12 lakh cases across the country. The percentage of divorcees against the total Muslim population was just 0.16% while the women's percentage is a mere 0.12%. ""On the pretext of giving justice to less than 0.1% of the total Muslim women in the country, the BJP is trying to defame the entire community and interfering in the Muslim Personal Law,"" he said.

" PM Modi roots for triple talaq bill, slams Congress | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday reaffirmed his government’s commitment to the triple talaq bill, which seeks to punish those who choose to practice instant oral divorce despite the Supreme Court outlawing the practice, as he launched a blistering attack on Congress for failing the minority community. “Congress got two opportunities to empower Muslim women. It could have promulgated the Uniform Civil Code after Independence but it chose to pass the Hindu Code bills and left it at that. It got a second opportunity in the Shah Bano case but it chose to reverse the Supreme Court order which had upheld a Muslim woman’s right to alimony,” the PM said. To buttress his criticism against Congress, Modi referred to an interview of Arif Mohammad Khan who, as a minister in the Rajiv Gandhi government, had pressed for implementation of the SC order but failed to persuade his leader and his party. Modi, who did not mention Khan’s name, referred to the former minister’s account of how senior Congress leaders had sought to nudge him to drop his insistence for adherence to the SC verdict in the Shah Bano matter. “Uplift of Muslims is not Congress’s responsibility, if they want to languish in the gutter, let them be,” some Congress leaders had told Khan. When contacted by TOI, Khan confirmed having made the statement in aTV interview. BJP’s Bihar ally JD(U), whose support can improve the prospect of passage of the legislation in Rajya Sabha, has arrayed itself against the legislation. On Monday, the party’s leader in Lok Sabha Rajiv Ranjan Singh opposed the legislation pretty much on the same grounds as parties in the opposition. But Modi’s steadfastness on the triple talaq bill can cause complications for Congress, which does not want to be seen as actively opposed to the legislation for the fear of being accused of “appeasement”. The Prime Minister’s aggression suggests that it will have to muster all the deftness at its disposal to resist being painted into the same corner as Asaduddin Owaisi of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen and the hardliners among the clergy.

It will be taught in LU’s sociology department at the postgraduate level as a topic in ‘Law and Society’ paper. Besides, topics related to LGBTQ and sociology of environment will also be introduced at PG level in the department. The aim is to educate students and create awareness so that the misuse of triple talaq (instant divorce) by a section of Muslim men is checked. The upgraded syllabus has been passed by the university’s board of studies and faculty board and will be placed before the academic council next month for final approval. “Triple talaq will be taught in the paper ‘Law and Society’ under the topic of law related to marriage and divorce. Under it, laws related to divorce for Hindus, Christian and Muslims will be taught. The issue of triple talaq has also been included with the view to develop understanding among the students about contemporary issues,” said Prof Sukant Chowdhury, a faculty in the sociology department and member of the team which proposed it in LU syllabus. “LU students are taught about the marriage laws and procedures of divorce in different religions at graduation and postgraduation levels. But the triple talaq law has been proposed in the syllabus to encourage academic debates on the issue,” said Prof Pawan Kumar Misra, a faculty in the department of sociology who is the brain behind the new proposal. Misra also said that students will be encouraged to pick topics like triple talaq and LGBT in their doctoral studies. This will lead to deeper understanding of vital social issues among the students, many of whom will become activists, administrators or policy makers in the future, Misra said. “Earlier, research scholars mostly focussed on topics like education and job status among the minority community.

We support what Quran says: Azam Khan on triple talaq | Meerut News - Times of India,"MEERUT: On the day when the government tabled a bill in Lok Sabha to ban the practice of instant triple talaq, Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan said that they support what is written in the Quran. “No religion has given more rights to women than Islam. 1500 years ago, Islam was the first religion to have given the right of equality to women. Today, we witness the lowest divorce rate and the lowest cases of violence on women in Islam. Women are not burnt or killed,” the Rampur MP was quoted by agencies as saying. “Triple talaq is a religious issue, not a political issue and nothing is more supreme for a Muslim than Quran. On marriage, on divorce, for everything, the Quran has clear instructions and we follow it,” he was quoted as saying. Khan who was in Delhi could not be contacted by TOI despite repeated attempts. His media in-charge told TOI that the MP will speak with the press in Rampur on Saturday. Notably, the Supreme Court while declaring triple talaq unconstitutional in its August 2017 order had observed that it is not recognised by the Quran and hence it couldn’t be a practice to be protected under the right to religion. The Centre taking a firm stand had asserted before the apex court that “triple talaq is not a basic and integral part of Islam”. Meanwhile, renowned Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband also reacted to the triple talaq bill on Friday, terming it a “direct interference” in their “religious freedom”. Darul Uloom’s vice-chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani said, “Triple talaq is an inseparable part of Islam and any law on that is a direct interference in the religious freedom guaranteed to us by the Constitution of India. When this is a religious matter of Muslims, let only Ulemas handle this.” Similarly, national president of Tanzeem Ulema-e-Hind, Maulana Ahmad Khizar Shah Masoodi, said, “The percentage of Muslims giving divorce as compared to people of other religions is abysmally low. At least, show us the statistics. Out of crores of Muslim women, a few opportunist ones have been put in the forefront to create an issue.” Maulana Nadeem al-Wajdi, president of All India Al-Quran Foundation said, “This is a religious matter and should be left to the religious scholars. Any interference into this is unacceptable.” The government on Friday introduced a fresh triple talaq bill in the Lok Sabha which faced strong protests from the opposition benches who claimed it was violation of the Constitution. In December 2017, Lok Sabha had passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, which had declared triple talaq “void and illegal”. It was made a non-bailable offence with up to three years of jail but the bill fell in Rajya Sabha where NDA was in minority. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Man gives instant talaq to wife for not giving birth to boy | Meerut News - Times of India,"MEERUT: On a day when the BJP-led Central government tabled a fresh instant triple talaq bill in Lok Sabha, a 32-year-old woman in Bulandshahr was thrown out of her house by her husband, who resorted to the now outlawed method to get rid of his wife for not giving birth to a boy.

The couple was married for the last ten years and had two children, both girls. The man, Ansaar Ahmad was not happy and wanted a boy, according to the complaint filed by his wife Aasha Ahmad. “Their relationship was strained due to it, and on Friday morning Ansaar pronounced the triple talaq,” a police officer said. Kamaruddin Ahmad, the woman’s brother, said, “After Aasha gave birth to her first child, relation between her and Ansaar become strained and she only hoped that the next child would be a son. But God had different plans and she gave birth to a girl yet again a few months ago.

 Speaker turns to Hindi while ordering vote on triple talaq | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Breaking with tradition, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Friday preferred to use Hindi when he said “haan paksh jeeta, haan paksha jeeta” instead of “the ayes have it, the ayes have it” while pronouncing his decision on the introduction of the fresh triple talaq bill. His pronouncement in Hindi came as a surprise to those who have been following the proceedings for long as they were used to hearing “the ayes or the noes (as the case may be) have it”. In recent memory, no other Speaker has used Hindi while pronouncing his or her decision in Lok Sabha.

 Voting on talaq bill puts Congress in a spot | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: As the Lok Sabha Speaker acceded to the demands of MIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi and ordered voting on ""triple talaq"" bill, Congress which led the vociferous protests against the legislation was found squirming at the surprise development.  Congress ranks were concerned and upset that voting on the bill, requiring a clear-cut ""yes or no"" vote, had clubbed the party with more hard-line elements opposed to it. The party had hoped the bill would be introduced after some arguments on merit, and would not become a drama. The nuancing is viewed as important for Congress which is increasingly worried about being painted as pandering to conservative Muslim sentiments.  The Lok Sabha defeat has only compounded the concern, as the ruling BJP has successfully pasted the charge on the party that it is tilted towards minorities.  Congress leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury told TOI , ""We only wanted the bill to be sent to the standing committee. We are not opposed to it."" Given the nature of the legislation, Congress has been attempting a tightrope walk of questioning the bill without opposing it.  Having blocked the bill in RS for two years, Congress managers conceded that it was impossible to persuade ""secular"" parties to take care of optics while questioning the bill.The BSP, SP and others were vociferous in their opposition in the upper House during the first Modi government, even as Congress tried to ground its reservations on specific points in the bill, if only to make them appear reasonable. What transpired in Lok Sabha on Friday reinforced the same handicap borne by Congress. Only that it appeared more damaging politically, having come just after the 2019 Lok Sabha debacle. As Speaker Om Birla ordered voting on the introduction of the bill, Congress managers were caught by surprise. The prolonged confrontation nullified the clarification that Congress' lead speaker Shashi Tharoor had prefaced his speech with -- ""We are not defending triple talaq but only questioning the text."" Concerned about the consequences of the development in the battle of political perception, sources said Congress strategists got together to discuss if they should issue a press statement to clarify the party's stand and distance the it from others.

" Amid Congress opposition, Lok Sabha OKs triple talaq bill 186-74 | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Modi government made a political point by introducing the fresh ""triple talaq"" bill seeking to ban and punish instant divorce among Muslims amid verbal clashes on the first functioning day in Lok Sabha and a formal division that was easily carried by the treasury benches. The decision to bring the bill, intended to replace an ordinance giving penal teeth to a Supreme Court order holding triple talaq as unconstitutional, at the start of the 17th Lok Sabha was a bid by BJP to underline a prominent poll pledge and urge opponents to reconsider in the light of the big endorsement NDA has received from voters.  As law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad sought permission to table the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, the opposition led by Congress objected to the legislation as ""discriminatory"" while the minister said it was not about religion but about ""justice to women"". With MIM's Asaduddin Owaisi seeking a vote, the government proposal won by 186-74, though in the process it left Congress in the difficult position of opposing the bill by vote after an election where it has been seen to be at the receiving end of Hindu polarisation. Prasad questioned the opposition's arguments, saying 229 cases of instant divorce have been reported even after the SC declared the practice as unconstitutional. ""Now what is to be done? Should the women hang the judgement in their homes? That is why a deterrence is a must,"" Prasad said justifying the bill. Congress's Shashi Tharoor started by clarifying that Congress was not defending ""triple talaq"" but was opposed to the text of the bill which ""conflates civil and criminal laws"". The government has argued that without penal provisions - some restrictions have been added - the SC ruling is meaningless. The bill has been in limbo for around two years with BJP lacking the numbers for its passage in Rajya Sabha. Its ally JD (U) has refused to support the bill and parties like BJD and AIADMK have opposed it too. However, BJP managers are hopeful of making a renewed push aided with some parties walking out rather than voting against the bill. The Centre promulgated ordinances in September 2018 and February 2019 as the contentious bill remained pending in Rajya Sabha after being passed by the lower House, and thus finally lapsed. On Friday, the Modi government ensured that it was the first item in the legislative business of the 17th Lok Sabha. It sets the stage for another debate on the bill, and its passage, in the lower House. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Triple Talaq Bill is 'unconstitutional', says Asaduddin Owaisi | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday claimed that the controversial Triple Talaq Bill is unconstitutional, saying it would be a great injustice against Muslim women if the Bill became law. ""Triple Talaq Bill is unconstitutional. It is a violation of the Constitution's Article 14 and 15. We already have the Domestic Violence Act 2005, CrPC Section 125, Muslim Women Marriage Act. If Triple Talaq Bill becomes a law it will be even greater injustice against women,"" he told reporters outside the Parliament. Voicing his opposal on the Bill, Owaisi said, ""If a man gets arrested how will he give allowance from jail? The government says if a Muslim man commits this crime the marriage will remain intact and he will be jailed for three years if punished by the court. He will be jailed for three yrs but marriage will be intact. What law is Mr (Narendra) Modi forming?"" ""I would like to ask him (Modi) what kind of justice is this that if such law is implemented on a non-Muslim man then he goes to jail for one year and a Muslim man goes to jail for three years,"" he added. The controversial Triple Talaq Bill was introduced on Friday in the Lok Sabha in the midst of stiff opposition from Opposition parties which are against criminalising the offence. The Opposition raised strong objections at the introduction itself. After a brief discussion, the motion for tabling the bill was put to vote. 186 members voted for introduction and 74 against. Speaker Om Birla then allowed Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to introduce the bill. Earlier he put up a stiff defence of the government move saying the issue was not of religion but of women. ""The rights of Muslim women will be protected. It is about justice & empowerment of women. People have chosen us to make laws. It is our work to make laws. Law is to give justice to the victims of Triple Talaq,"" he had said in the House. There was a commotion in the Lok Sabha when the minister sought to introduce the bill. The Speaker had to intervene to let the Minister speak on the bill amidst the ruckus. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor had claimed that the Bill does nothing to improve the status of Muslim women. Owaisi, on the other hand, argued that the Bill places burden of proof on women. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 seeks to replace an ordinance by the government in February and to make instant triple talaq a penal offence. Last year, The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018 was passed in Lok Sabha but it lapsed after the dissolution of previous Lok Sabha with the bill pending in Rajya Sabha.

"Triple talaq: Fresh triple talaq bill introduced in Lok Sabha, opposition members protest | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The government on Friday introduced the fresh triple talaq bill in the Lok Sabha amid vehement protests by opposition members who claimed that it was violative of the Constitution. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019 became the first legislation to be tabled in Parliament by the Narendra Modi dispensation in its second term, with law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad asserting the legislation was a must for gender equality and justice. Times ViewThe government tabled the triple talaq bill today and said the aim was to ensure justice and gender equality. The aim deserves support but the method adopted is unwarranted. Supreme Court has already set aside the practice of triple talaq. Therefore, it has no legal sanctity. A bill to criminalise it is meaningless and can result in unforeseen complications. Instead, the practice must be fought in the social realm.Union Cabinet approves triple talaq billThe bill was introduced following a division of votes, with 186 members supporting and 74 opposing it. ""This is not a question of religion but about justice to women,"" Prasad said. Eradication of 'Triple Talaq' and 'Nikah-Halala' imperative for ensuring women equality: President KovindSeeking to justify the need to bring in the legislation, Prasad said there were 543 cases of triple talaq reported in the country. After the Supreme Court judgement banning triple talaq practise, Prasad said more than 200 cases were reported. ""This is a question of dignity of women and we are committed to (safeguard) it,"" he said. He said the job of Parliament was to legislate and it was up to courts to interpret the law. As soon as Speaker Om Birla asked Prasad to move the bill, several opposition members rose in protest and Birla allowed them to put forth their point of view. Shashi Tharoor of the Congress said he was opposed to triple talaq (instant divorce) but was against this bill as it conflates civil and criminal laws. He claimed it was a textbook example of class legislation as it was pointed at one community — Muslims — even though abandoning wives is not unique to it. Tharoor said there should be a law universally applicable to all in case of abandoning wives. Asaduddin Owaisi of the AIMIM took a dig at the BJP, saying it has so much affection for Muslim women but is opposed to rights of Hindu women to enter Sabrimala Temple in Kerala. The triple talaq bill violates constitutional rights as it stipulates three-year jail term for guilty Muslim men while non-Muslim men get only one year of jail term for a similar offence, he said.

" Our goal is to empower every person, says President Ram Nath Kovind | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday outlined the governance agenda for the Narendra Modi government while addressing the first joint session of Parliament in the 17th Lok Sabha. The President’s address stressed upon government’s core political agenda like pushing the NRC and Citizenship Bill beyond Assam in the country and also pushing for developing large scale investments in rural India, including Rs 25 lakh crore for measures to enhance agricultural productivity and promising to bring in a new industrial policy soon. In his hour-long address, the President said national security was paramount for the government as he touched upon surgical strikes and air strikes on Pakistan-based terror camps. He underlined the government's resolve to remove “social evils” of triple talaq and 'nikah halala' and promised to intensify the crackdown on corruption. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and MPs of both Houses in attendance, the President said the Lok Sabha polls had enhanced the credibility of the Indian democracy as a record number of 61 crore people voted, including the highest share of women. Kovind said empowering every person in the country is the main goal of the ruling dispensation which wants to build a 'New India' by 2022 where there is no discrimination on grounds of caste or religion. “The people of the country have given a very clear mandate in this election. After assessing the performance of the government during its first tenure, people have given even stronger support for the second term. By doing so, they have given a mandate for continuing uninterrupted and at an accelerated pace the journey of development which started in 2014,” he said. He also pushed for simultaneous elections in the country, saying it is the “need of the hour.” Kovind said due to frequent elections being held in some part of the country or the other, the pace and continuity of development programmes have been impacted. “Therefore, I urge all Members of Parliament to seriously ponder over this development-oriented proposal of One Nation - Simultaneous Elections,” he said, a day after the PM met with leaders of 21 parties on the issue. To fulfil its resolution of building a 'New India', the government in a short period of 21 days has taken many decisions aimed at welfare of farmers, soldiers, students, entrepreneurs, women and other sections of society and have also started implementing them, Kovind said, adding initiatives have been taken to enact several new laws. He mentioned pension schemes for farmers and small traders, and extending the scheme to give Rs 6000 input subsidy to all farmers. Noting that a strong national economy can be built only on the foundation of a strong rural economy, he said an investment of Rs 25 lakh crore will be made in the coming years in order to enhance agriculture productivity. To double the income of farmers by 2022, when India will complete its 75 years of Independence, several steps have been taken in the last five years, the President said. Talking about the federal structure of the country, Kovind said “strengthening the system and spirit of cooperative federalism, my government is taking the states along to achieve national goals.” The central government has decided to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC), currently being updated in Assam, on priority basis in areas affected by infiltration, Kovind said, adding that efforts will be made to amend the Citizenship Act while protecting linguistic, cultural and social identities. “My government has decided to implement the process of National Register of Citizens on priority basis in areas affected by infiltration,” he said. He, however, did not specify in which areas the NRC will be implemented. The President said while on one hand, the government is working to identify infiltrators, on the other, it is also fully committed to protecting those who are victims of persecution due to their faith in neighbouring countries. “In this regard, efforts will be made to amend the Citizenship Act while protecting the linguistic, cultural and social identities,” he said.

 Fresh triple talaq bill in Lok Sabha on Friday | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A fresh bill to ban the practice of instant triple talaq will be introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, which has been listed in the Lok Sabha's agenda for Friday, will replace an ordinance issued in February by the previous BJP-led NDA government. With the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha last month, the previous bill had lapsed as it was pending in the Rajya Sabha. The Bill, which proposes to make the practice of instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddat) a penal offence, had faced objections from the opposition parties which claimed that jail term for a man for divorcing his wife was legally untenable. The new bill is a copy of the ordinance in force. Bills that are introduced in the Rajya Sabha and are pending there do not lapse with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. However, bills passed by the Lok Sabha and pending in the Rajya Sabha lapse with the dissolution of the lower house. The government had promulgated the ordinance on triple talaq twice -- in September 2018 and in February 2019 -- as the contentious bill remained pending in the Rajya Sabha, though it was passed by the Lok Sabha. Under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2019, divorcing through instant triple talaq is illegal, void and will attract a jail term of three years for the husband. Seeking to allay fears that the proposed law could be misused, the government has included certain safeguards in it such as adding a provision for bail for the accused during trial. These amendments were cleared by the Cabinet on August 29, 2018. While the ordinance makes it a ""non-bailable"" offence, an accused can approach a magistrate even before trial to seek bail. In a non-bailable offence, bail cannot be granted by police at the police station itself. A provision was added to allow the magistrate to grant bail ""after hearing the wife"", the government had said. In the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha, the new government plans to convert 10 ordinances, including the one to ban the practice of instant triple talaq, into law. The ordinances were issued in February-March this year by the previous government as these could not be converted into Acts of Parliament in the last session of the 16th Lok Sabha. Since the Narendra Modi government returned to power in the recently held elections, it has decided to give a fresh push to these proposed laws in the newly-constituted Lok Sabha. These ordinances will have to be converted into laws within 45 days of the beginning of the session, else they will lapse. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Eradication of 'Triple Talaq' and 'Nikah-Halala' imperative for ensuring women equality: President Kovind | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind Thursday said eradication of social evils like 'Triple Talaq' and 'Nikah-Halala' is imperative for ensuring equal rights for women in the country. In his address to both the houses of the Parliament in the Central Hall, Kovind urged all the members to cooperate in these efforts to make the lives of women ""better and dignified"". ""To secure equal rights for every sister and daughter in the country, eradication of social evils like 'Triple Talaq' and 'Nikah-Halala' is imperative,"" Kovind said in his customary address after formation of the 17th Lok Sabha. Under instant 'triple talaq', a Muslim man can divorce his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times in one go. 'Nikah halala' requires a divorced woman to marry and consummate the marriage with another man before she can return to her first husband. The Supreme Court has ruled instant 'triple talaq' as unconstitutional following which the previous government introduced a bill to make it a criminal offence. But the Bill could not be passed in Parliament in the wake of stiff resistance from the Opposition. The government brought an ordinance to implement the Supreme Court order. Lauding the election of 78 women MPs - the highest number in the history of Lok Sabha - Kovind said it presents the picture of a new India. Underscoring women empowerment as one of the top priorities of the government, Kovind said their effective involvement in society and economy is the ""touchstone"" of a developed society. ""The government's thinking promotes not only women's development but also women-led development. According the highest priority to women's security, several effective steps have been initiated with the cooperation of the states,"" he said. He said penalties for crimes against women have been made ""harsher"" and the new penal provisions are being strictly enforced. The 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' campaign has brought down female foeticide and improved the sex ratio in many districts of the country. Noting that rural women are the biggest beneficiaries as they have got freedom from smoke through 'Ujjwala Yojana', vaccination through 'Mission Indradhanush' and free electricity connections under 'Saubhagya Yojana', Kovind said women are also being given priority in the registration of houses built under 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana' in the rural areas. ""Under this scheme, nearly 2 crore new houses will be built in the villages during the next three years,"" he said. He said facilities for the women workers in the unorganized sector are also being augmented. ""Self-employment opportunities are being made available to rural women through 'Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rashtriya Aajivika Mission'. Under the 'Rashtriya Aajivika Mission', loans amounting to more than Rs 2 lakh crore have been disbursed so far to 3 crore women in rural areas,"" he said. He added that the government is trying to make women ""equal stakeholders"" in the country's development and prosperity. ""Efforts will be made in collaboration with industry and corporate sector to provide better employment opportunities to women. ""In addition, in government procurement, priority will be given to those enterprises where women's participation in the workforce is more than the prescribed limit,"" he added.

The government had promulgated as many as 10 ordinances for the session which ends on July 26 and will have 30 sittings. Among the bills that will be introduced, the one on triple talaq could prove to be contentious.

It remains to be seen whether the new Speaker will be a woman and if so whether it could be former minister Maneka Gandhi, also a senior MP. Before Mahajan, during the second term of the UPA, the post was held by Meira Kumar who became the first woman Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The Union Budget will be presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 5, preceded by a pre-Budget Economic survey on July 4.

JD(U) secretary general and spokesperson K C Tyagi said the party would oppose the bill in the upcoming session of Parliament as it holds different view on the issue. “Any view shouldn’t be imposed on the Muslims without wide consultations. It’s a social issue and should be resolved at social level,” he said. Tyagi’s statement assumed significance in the wake of differences cropping up among the NDA constituents after the formation of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for the second term. Tyagi, who had come to Patna last week to attend the national executive committee meeting, said the JD(U) had its clear stand on issues like Uniform Civil Code, Article 370 and the Ayodhya dispute. To drive home his point, Tyagi said, “Ours is a democratic country and its fabric should be maintained. The laws and governing principles for different religions and ethnic groups should be respected. Any view imposed on any group without substantial consultations may prove fatal for the democratic set up.” On Thursday, Bihar industries minister Shyam Rajak had also said the JD(U) differed from BJP on the triple talaq issue and would oppose the bill in the Rajya Sabha.

Will oppose triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha: Shyam Rajak | Patna News - Times of India,"PATNA: JD(U), an ally of NDA, on Thursday made it clear that it will oppose the the triple talaq bill when it is placed in the Rajya Sabha. “JD(U) has its own stand and will oppose the triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha. We have already made our stand clear on the issue and there is no confusion about it,” Bihar industries minister Shyam Rajak said here. Rajak, who is among the eight JD(U) ministers inducted into the Nitish Kumar cabinet recently, told TOI, “JD(U) has a different view from BJP on issues like Article 370 and Article 35A.” Rajak’s statement assumes significance in the wake of differences between the two important NDA constituents, BJP and JD(U) in the state and at the Centre. JD(U)’s refusal to join the council of ministers at the Centre with a “symbolic representation” and subsequent decision by BJP not to be given any ministerial berth in the recent cabinet expansion in Bihar, gave rise to speculations that the two partners were not comfortable with each other. However, Nitish categorically denied any differences among the NDA partners and said the alliance is intact in Bihar and at the Centre. JD(U), at its national executive committee meeting in Patna on June 9, also decided to contest state assembly elections in Jharkhand, Haryana, Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir on its own. The new triple talaq bill, approved by the Union Cabinet led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, is likely to be presented in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha beginning on June 17. The bill was passed by the previous Lok Sabha but could not cross the Rajya Sabha hurdle as the government lacked numbers and the opposition parties had objections on the criminal provisions in the bill. The bill lapsed with the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha and has to be re-introduced. In February, the Centre had promulgated an ordinance banning triple talaq and made it a penal offence. “Triple talaq is a social issue and it should be resolved through dialogue and with the help of the social organizations. There is no need of any legislation (read law) to settle the issue. The bill couldn’t be tabled in the Rajya Sabha in the last session because of the JD(U)’s opposition,” Rajak said, adding that the party would oppose it at all levels. Nitish, who is also the JD(U) national president, had opposed the bill earlier also. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

 Congress to oppose some provisions in triple talaq bill | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: With the government all set to bring a fresh bill in Parliament to ban the practice of instant triple talaq, the Congress on Thursday said there are still some issues which it will debate and oppose. The bill will be introduced in the Budget session which begins on Monday to replace an ordinance issued in February by the previous BJP-led NDA government. With the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha last month, the previous bill had lapsed as it was pending in Rajya Sabha. Asked about the bill, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said: ""We had raised a number of issues. Many of the contentious issues the government had agreed upon.... So we had success after a long time."" ""A lot of time would have been saved if the government had agreed on our points earlier. Now one or two issues are left for example financial security for the family on which we will debate and oppose,"" he said. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, which made the practice of instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddat) a penal offence, had faced objections from the opposition parties which claimed that jail term for a man for divorcing his wife was legally untenable. The fresh bill was cleared by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday. In the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha, the new government plans to convert 10 ordinances, including the one to ban the practice of instant triple talaq, into law. The ordinances were issued in February-March this year by the previous government as these could not be converted into Acts of Parliament in the last session of the 16th Lok Sabha. Since the Narendra Modi government returned to power in the recently held elections, it has decided to give a fresh push to these proposed laws in the newly-constituted Lok Sabha. These ordinances will have to be converted into laws within 45 days of the beginning of the session, else they will lapse. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

The Uttar Pradesh unit of BJP has asked its minority wing to reach out to these women and greet them on Eid. BJP minority cell member who was appointed in charge of triple talaq victims, Nazia Alam, said Eid is an auspicious occasion and the party will greet these women to give them a healing touch. Speaking to TOI, Alam said they would also be gifted a copy of Quran transcribed in Hindi. “There are many who don’t know what is written in Quran about triple talaq. Even if one of them becomes aware, it would help others too,” she said. Alam admitted most victims are not vocal and avoid coming into limelight due to the social taboo attached with talaq. “We have decided to keep their identities and phone numbers under wraps,” she said. UP BJP sources said most cases of triple talaq were reported from districts like Bareilly and Moradabad which have big population of Muslims. Alam said that till a law is framed to protect them, the women would continue to live in fear. BJP’s move to extend Eid wishes to instant triple talaq victims comes amid Centre’s plan to bring a bill banning the practice in Parliament once again.

Narendra Modi:   Why PM Narendra Modi wears Hinduism on his sleeves | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In a span of just a month, Narendra Modi, who will take oath as Prime Minister on May 30 for the second consecutive term, was seen worshipping in temples for the fourth time on Monday. Modi’s temple visits appeared to have a specific purpose - unite the Hindus. This has been one of the BJP's strategies in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections -- one that has paid rich dividends. The BJP has improved upon its 2014 tally of 282 out of 543 seats by winning 303 out of 542 seats in 2019. Election in Vellore was deferred due to financial irregularities. On several occasions while campaigning, Narendra Modi said there were only two castes - the poor and those working to alleviate poverty. Till he was made the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party was largely known as a Bania-Brahmin party which was mainly dominant in the urban areas. PM Modi performing 'aarti' on the banks of Ganga at Varanasi on April 25.One of the first steps which Narendra Modi took after becoming the PM candidate in 2013 was to appoint Amit Shah as BJP general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Amit Shah had already displayed successful election management skills in Gujarat - his and Modi’s home state. However, starting with UP, Modi and Shah started changing the party’s structure and political equations. They selected the right candidates according to the caste equations in respective constituencies. Imran Masood, the Congress candidate from Saharanpur, gave a handle to the BJP to consolidate voters by saying that he would chop Narendra Modi to pieces. The BJP won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats alone in UP in 2014, which helped the party to come to power. Next, the Modi government at the Centre went on to take a number of steps to unite the Hindus. PM Modi outside Kedarnath temple on May 18.The BJP-led NDA government made several announcements, launched many schemes and made a number of symbolic gestures to woo the Dalits, OBCs and all castes of the general category. For the Dalits, Narendra Modi visited Mhow near Indore on April 14, 2016, on the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. Mhow is the birthplace of Ambedkar. On April 20, 2015, he laid the foundation stone of Dr Ambedkar International Centre at Janpital in the capital. On November 14, 2015, he inaugurated BR Ambedkar Memorial in London. Besides these, Ram Nath Kovind, a Dalit, was made the President of the country in July 2017. For the OBCs, Parliament passed the Constitution (123rd Amendment) Bill last year to provide constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes. For the poor in the general category, the government got the Constitutional (124th Amendment) Bill passed in Parliament. It grants 10 per cent quota to the general category candidates in government jobs and educational institutions. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah made even stronger attempts to consolidate Hindu voters during the 2017 UP assembly elections. They spoke about the discriminatory treatment meted out to the Hindus in the state by the previous Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party and Mayawati-headed BSP governments. This effort bore fruit. The BJP won 325 candidates in the house of 403 seats. These measures helped the BJP consolidate the Hindu votes. Narendra Modi inside a cave in Kedarnath on May 18. Talking to timesofindia.com, TMC leader Chandan Mitra said no other political leader has taken pride in religious identity as much as Modi. “Modi is different. I don’t think it intimidates others. He is a devout Hindu. There is obviously a Hindu element and ideological plank in his actions. It is not surprising that many of his actions are intended to unite Hindus and to create us and them scenario,” Mitra, formerly a BJP Rajya Sabha MP, said. During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Modi, in not-so-subtle ways, was always aiming for consolidation of Hindu votes. This is self-evident as in the last one month, he worshipped in temples on three occasions in a grand manner. On the first occasion, Modi filed his nomination from Varanasi on April 26. A day earlier he took out a massive roadshow in his constituency. After the roadshow came to an end, he performed ‘aarti’ along with BJP president Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other party leaders. The second occasion came a day before the seventh and last phase of the elections. On May 18, Narendra Modi reached Kedarnath in Uttarakhand and worshipped in the famous temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. He then went to a cave and spent the night inside it. PM Narendra Modi at Badrinath on May 19.The next day, on May 19, the day of last phase of elections, Narendra Modi reached Badrinath and payed obeisance at the temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. And finally, on the May 27 morning, he was back to Varanasi, where he was seen worshipping at the Kashi Vishwanath temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. For the first time perhaps, the elaborate rituals which took place in the sanctum sanctorum of the famous Kashi temple, were telecast live. Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath accompanied him inside the sanctum sanctorum. Modi was shown getting his forehead smeared with ‘chandan’ (sandalwood) and ‘tika’ by the priest. Shortly thereafter, Yogi Adityanath, Amit Shah and Narendra Modi addressed a meeting of the party workers of Varanasi. With chandan and tika still smeared on his forehead, Narendra Modi wondered how Diwali was not allowed to be celebrated in Ayodhya all these years till Yogi Adityanath’s BJP government came to power. Besides consolidating the Hindus, the BJP has sought to divide the Muslims, particularly by wooing the Muslim women. PM Modi worshipping inside the sanctum of Kashi Vishwanath temple at Varanasi on May 27.The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018 was passed by Lok Sabha in December 2018. However, it could not come up for discussion in the Rajya Sabha. The government subsequently promulgated an ordinance banning triple talaq. Apart from these, the Modi government’s development initiatives such as constructing toilets, distributing LPG cylinders and electrifying households have helped women cutting across castes and religions. These measures helped the BJP defeat the regional parties by breaching their votebanks. For instance, the BJP was successful in negating SP’s Muslim-Yadav (MY) and BSP’s Dalit-Muslim votebanks in UP and corruption convict Lalu Prasad-led RJD’s MY combination in Bihar. While the BSP won 10 seats and SP 5, RJD failed to open its account. The BJP on the other hand won 62 of the 78 seats it contested and its alliance partner Apna Dal won both the seats it contested. OppositionWhile the BJP has been trying to unite the Hindus and divide the Muslims, and with considerable success, the opposition parties have been doing exactly the opposite. They have been trying to divide the Hindus into different castes and consolidate the Muslim vote. For instance, almost all opposition parties including the Congress, have harped on the charge that the BJP was against Dalits and Muslims. Besides, SP and RJD formed the Muslim-Yadav combination as a formidable votebank to come to power while BSP combined the Dalits and the Muslims with a little help from Brahmins to formulate a winning formula. However, the BJP, led by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah toppled the Opposition’s game plan by uniting the Hindus to a large extent and possibly garnering the votes of a chunk of Muslim women.

Mainaz Begum came up with the idea while names for the boy were being discussed on May 23, the day the Lok Sabha results came in and Narendra Modi won a massive mandate.

‘Muslim women favoured Modi on triple talaq issue’ | Patna News - Times of India,"BETTIAH: On Sunday before last, BJP’s incumbent MP from Paschim Champaran, Sanjay Jaiswal, was attacked at Shekhauna in the Narkatia assembly segment. “I would have been lynched had my bodyguards not fired in the air,” Jaiswal had told this newspaper. “Hindu voters were brutally assaulted in this Muslim dominated village...I had gone to protest before polling officers,” he had said. “See my track record. I’ve never turned away Muslims seeking my help...but neither will I tolerate intimidation and assault of Hindu voters,” Jaiswal had then said. On Thursday, as Jaiswal registered his hat-trick victory, he gushed: “I have led by 30 votes in the same village.... This clearly shows that Muslims too have voted for Modi ji...It is a vindication of our ‘sab ka saath...’ credo.” As Jaiswal’s lead was peaking to his eventual 2.93 lakh victory margin, Shashi Bhushan Kumar — an exit pollster with Cicero — shared his findings with this reporter. “We interviewed a large number of voters coming out from the polling booths...many of the women we talked to were Muslim,” Kumar recounted his encounters outside polling booths across 14 districts in Bihar. “A significant section of women Muslim voters voted for the BJP,” he recalled. “The results confirm what we found out,” he said, explaining that his team spoke with women voters separately. “Even where couples came out after voting, we persuaded the husbands to let us speak to their spouses alone,” he said, sharing the revelation, “We found that many Muslim women had voted for the Lotus.” The exit-pollster said: “Many of the Muslim women who voted for BJP said they were swayed by PM Modi’s stand on triple talaq. Women who had suffered divorce themselves or whose dear ones had to undergo the ignominy of triple talaq, were unequivocally clear on their choice,” he said, adding that the PM’s reach went beyond this. “The Ujjwala and toilet schemes too swung women voters towards Modi ji,” he said. “My 30-vote lead in a hostile Muslim village is not an aberration. Our schemes for women like the Ujjwala, apart from the triple talaq issue, have been a game changer,” Jaiswal said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

" Fearing triple talaq, woman seeks SC’s help | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Anticipating that her husband, who has already given two talaq notices, might take the illegal and unconstitutional route of triple triple to end their marriage, a Muslim woman approached the SC on Thursday and sought its intervention to restrain him. Appearing before a bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and Sanjiv Khanna, the woman’s advocate M M Kashyap mentioned the petition and sought an urgent hearing. He said the husband had sent two talaq notices — on March 29 and May 7 — and the third notice might be sent any time to complete the process of triple talaq. An SC Constitution bench had in August 2017 held the Muslim practice of triple talaq unconstitutional and had struck it down by 3:2 majority. The SC had said triple talaq violated fundamental rights of Muslim women as it irrevocably ended marriage without any chance of reconciliation. Referring to the SC’s verdict, the petitioner urged the court to declare the process adopted by her husband as illegal. She contended that the Centre had brought the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2019, which made triple talaq an offence. Under the ordinance, divorcing through instant triple talaq is illegal, void and would attract a jail term of three years for the husband.

Triple talaq victims to vote for Modi: UP minister - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Victims of instant triple talaq will vote for Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary said Monday, barely 24 hours after the prime minister targeted opposition parties over the centuries-old tradition in Islam. Talking to PTI, the minister for minority welfare said the various educational reforms in the madrassa system will also prove to be beneficial for the party in the ongoing elections. ""The numerous beneficiaries of various welfare schemes, the victims of triple talaq and the educated women will vote for Modiji,"" Chaudhary said.

""I cannot say whether it will be 20 per cent or 25 per cent, but this is certain that those women who have benefitted from government schemes will definitely give their mandate in favour of the BJP,"" the minister said. On educational reforms, Chaudhary said, ""Our effort was to integrate the madrassa course with the CBSE syllabus. Our endeavour is that madrassas should produce engineers, doctors, IAS and IPS. The educated people understand very well that they are getting the benefits of various welfare schemes without any discrimination."" Citing an example, he said, the examination of the UP madrassas were completed before the CBSE and UP board examinations and the results were also declared much before the others. ""The government gave scholarships to madrassa students and the teachers were paid salaries through direct benefit transfer and no one found any discrimination in that,"" Chaudhary said.

BJP doubles down on triple talaq plank to woo Muslims - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Five years ago, BJP was buoyed by the instant triple talaq poll plank to woo minorities, but the issue failed to find traction in the community, much to the party’s discomfiture. The party has failed to track down victims to buttress its agenda. BJP workers said triple talaq victims have not been forthcoming, despite the saffron party constituting a dedicated team to get them aligned with the party. Chief of UP BJP minority cell, Haider Abbas, said the stigma associated with talaq was the biggest hurdle. “We have been scouring districts to find them, but not many came forward.” The move is seen as BJP’s strategy to cut into the Muslim vote bank, which is being eyed by both the gathbandhan and Congress. “A list of victims has been prepared in every district. Our workers will reach out to them and convince them,” he said. Abbas, however, failed to give details on the number of victims. “We are still in the process of preparing the list,” he said.

Girl granted khula after groom utters triple talaaq in inebriated condition | Ranchi News - Times of India,"RANCHI: A Muslim woman on Thursday refused to marry her prospective groom after he arrived for the wedding inebriated and pronounced talaaq thrice during the rituals. The qazi said the marriage cannot be construed solemnized and a ‘khula’ (divorce) must be granted to the woman. The woman agreed with the qazi, saying she would not marry someone who uses alcohol, which is prohibited in Islam. Police had to be called to the venue at Maulana Azad colony as the woman’s family manhandled the baraatis soon after the incident.

He went on to pronounce “talaaq” thrice. Rukhsana immediately said she would not want an addict or a drunkard and refused the nikaah proceedings. The qazi intervened and granted the bride a “khula” so that she could be free to marry someone else. Qazi Hazi Sahood Alam said: “Soon after the girl refused to marry Akram, I intervened and granted them a Khula after completing all the religious formalities in presence of two witnesses.

After the deductions, a mehr Rs2.5 lakh was paid to her family in compensation,” added Alam.

Triple talaq champion forsaken by BJP | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Ishrat Jahan, BJP’s poster girl in the instant triple talaq movement, is struggling to make the ends meet. Two square meals and a decent education for her son — that is what the gutsy woman wants now. Reeling under a financial crisis, Jahan, who had joined BJP little more than a year ago, is now planning to quit politics. Jahan shot to limelight after she lodged a case with the Supreme Court in 2015 when her husband had telephoned from Dubai and uttered ‘talaq’ thrice over the phone. Jahan, who refused to accept the talaq over phone, was one of the five women who had moved the apex court. The 32-year-old mother of four kids faced intimidations and threats, but continued to fight her battle as destitution and social stigma continued to chase her. The case finally led to the historic verdict on instant triple talaq in 2017. In January last year, Jahan joined BJP amid much fanfare. Overnight, she had turned into an icon in the fight against instant triple talaq. BJP leaders said her popularity had even prompted the party to consider her as a potential candidate in the Lok Sabha polls. A year down the line, Jahan has now taken up part-time tailoring job to earn bread for the family. “‘Bahot Taqleef hai. Agar main silai na karoon to aur kuchh nehin, bhukha marna padega’ (I am in a deep trouble. If I don’t do tailoring work, we will have to starve),” she said. During her fight against instant triple talaq, Jahan had angered a section of people. “Many of them did not like my joining the BJP. So, they try to avoid me. I have to meet people and ask if they have any tailoring job for me,” she said. The woman wakes up in her small dingy house at Pilkhana, Howrah, early in the morning to finish sewing job and then goes out for the party’s work. She spends hours at the party office and meetings to share her experience and educate women against instant triple talaq. “‘Abhi to full time ho gaya’ (I work full time for the party). Each day I go out for party work. Either I visit the party office or they instruct me where to go,” she said. But extended hours of political work have gradually eaten up her time to complete the tailoring jobs at hand. Her nine-year old son, Zahid, stays home alone. “I do not get enough time to visit shops and take orders. Had I not been into politics, I could have done some work,” she said. “That is why I am considering whether I should at all continue politics,” she said. Party leaders, whom Jahan meets on a regular basis, are aware of her financial distress. “I am aware about her condition. Let’s see what can be done for her,” said BJP president Dilip Ghosh.

The petitioner, Jesmin Begum, had lodged an FIR with Rangia police on January 13, alleging that her husband had pronounced triple talaq in written form, talaq-e-biddat - a penal offence under Section 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection) of Rights on Marriage Ordinance, 2018, made non-bailable under Section 7 of the ordinance. The police had, instead, registered a case of husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty under Section 498 A of IPC. Subsequently, the additional district and sessions judge of Kamrup at Rangia granted anticipatory bail to the husband Asif Iqbal Hussain on February 15. Begum then approached the court against the Rangia police station in charge for not invoking the provisions of the Muslim Women (Protection) of Rights on Marriage Ordinance, 2018, which make triple talaq illegal.

Even as he was on his way to Ayodhya, micro-blogging site Twitter deleted two contentious tweets by him, where he had referred to Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) as a ‘green virus’, following directions from EC. A message from Twitter Support has replaced the tweets, “This Tweet from @myogiadityanath has been withheld in India in response to a legal demand,” it said. Before leaving for Ayodhya, Yogi also met victims of triple talaq at his official residence. Officials said that he was ‘keeping no difference between Hindus and Muslims’ and that ‘he had attended to two Muslim women's concern over triple talaq’. “Niaz Begum, a triple talaq victim, told CM that her husband used to demand dowry after marriage and her father-in-law used to torture her for not being able to meet their demands. Her husband had given her triple talaq and married another woman. The CM assured her of justice after which the victim expressed happiness,” a UP government statement said. Officials attached with CM's media team said that they would register a protest with Twitter.

 Triple talaq crusaders continue to fight for survival | India News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: The Triple Talaq Bill has been a major poll plank of the BJP, with the party trying its best to woo a section of minorities with the legislation, even as those who had led the crusade against the practice continue to fight for their survival. In its recently released manifesto for Lok Sabha polls, the saffron party, which failed to legislate the bill in Parliament due to stiff resistance by the opposition, has pledged to eliminate the practices of instant talaq and nikah halala if re-elected to power. Vijaya Rahatkar, the national president of the party's Mahila Morcha, said the efforts of the Narendra Modi government to pass the Triple Talaq Bill ""will surely yield positive results for the BJP"" in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls. Ironically, anti-triple talaq champions - Ishrat Jahan, Shayara Bano and Atiya Sabri - who had moved the Supreme Court to seek an end to the practice of instant divorce continue to live in abject poverty, with little or no means of income. The court, in a landmark judgment in 2017, held the practice ""void"" and ""unconstitutional"". Divorced in April 2015, Ishrat Jahan lives with her two children in neighbouring Howrah district. ""I am struggling to make both ends meet. I don't have money to send my children to school. As of now, I depend on my relatives for financial assistance,"" she told PTI. Jahan had joined the BJP in 2018 and was initially expected to be one of the major minority faces of the party in Bengal. It was also speculated that she would figure in BJP's list of Lok Sabha candidates in the state. ""Things appear to have changed. I am not in touch with the party any more. At times I visit party meetings, but that's about it,"" she said, when asked if the BJP leaders inquire about her. The story is no different for Shayara Bano and Atiya Sabri, who live under stressful financial conditions with no help from their divorced husbands. ""She doesn't have any income of her own ... We try to help her in whatever way we can,"" Bano's brother Arshad told PTI from Uttar Pradesh. Sabri's brother Rizwan, who is a resident of Uttarakhand, said the family wants the court matter to be disposed off soon. He appealed to both the state and central governments to look into the early disposal of the case. ""My sister stays with me. She is part of my family. We don't want any financial help, we just want this matter to end soon,"" Rizwan said. Two other petitioners, Afreen Rahman and Gulshan Parween, could not be contacted. Rahatkar, when apprised of the condition of the three women, said she had met Jahan and assured her of financial assistance. ""We should always stand by those women who have suffered but not given up. I spoke to Ishrat and told her that we will provide assistance if she needed to send her children to school. We are also willing to give her loan under the government's Mudra scheme to help her start a business,"" Rahatkar told PTI. Arguing that the triple Talaq Bill does not empower women, Sushmita, the president of All India Mahila Congress, said ""criminalizing the practice isn't the solution"". ""How does it (bill) help a Muslim woman? Punishing the husband does not guarantee financial support for the woman. If you talk about empowering a woman, you have to find her suitable means of income,"" Dev said. Uzma Alam, the convenor of Bengal unit of the women's cell of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said ""no one but Jahan was responsible for her precarious condition"". ""When she had issues with her husband and was given the talaq, I told her that we would help her in finding a job and make arrangements for her remarriage.

Minority report: Bid to raise turnout over 2014 - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Several political leaders, activists and NGOs have launched a campaign to ensure 100% voting in pockets populated by Muslims. The 2014 Lok Sabha elections’ voting percentage in these minority areas was very low (33%) and hence, community leaders have begun a drive to persuade residents here to go and exercise their franchise at polling booths on April 29. Also, with issues like mob lynching, triple talaq bill and promise of Uniform Civil Code(UCC) featuring in the BJP’s agenda, Muslims are being told to defeat “communal” forces. At a meeting by NGO Public Complaint Centre in south Mumbai on Thursday, speakers called upon the community to vote to unseat the BJP. Abdul Razzak Maniar, who heads the Public Complaint Centre, said several jamaats and NGOs had decided to persuade the community to treat voting as a “farz” (obligation) because their survival as Muslims is at stake. “Our rights and religious freedom guaranteed by the Constitution are at stake. Those who threaten the Constitutional rights must be voted out and for that, we need to vote in large numbers and help the secular candidates win,” said Maniar, resolving to hold several such awareness campaigns in Muslim pockets. Activist and political leaders are telling voters that voting is an important Constitutional right and citizens must utilise it to elect right candidates. “We are telling people to postpone their visits outside the city and exercise their right without fail,” said Congress MLA Amin Patel, who has attended a series of meetings held to encourage people to vote. Though the majority of Muslim votes are expected to stay with Congress-NCP, a chunk may go to “spoilers” in the fray. Antiterrorism crusader and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi candidate Dr A R Anjaria from Mumbai North Central said that the fact that Congress-NCP didn’t heed the community’s demand to field at least one Muslim from the city had disappointed the community. “Congress only wants Muslims’ votes but is not ready to give representation to the community. We will show that we are not anybody’s ghulam (slave),” said Anjaria. Several NGOs also held a meeting at Marathi Patrakar Sangh on Friday evening. “We have appealed to the masses to understand that this is an important election and we must support the strongest secular candidates in the city’s six seats,” said activist Firoz Mithiborewala.

"BJP manifesto a plot to break secular fabric, alleges IUML | Trichy News - Times of India","TRICHY: The BJP poll manifesto is a strategic plan to break the secular fabric of the country and turn it into a Hindu polity, alleged the national president of Indian Union Muslim League, K M Kader Mohideen, here on Thursday. He told newsmen that BJP in Hindi meant the party of all Indians, but it advocated Hindu polity. On the other hand, he claimed that IUML never promoted Muslim polity. He was replying to a question on IUML’s presence in the secular progressive alliance though welfare of Muslims was the founding principle of the party. Mohideen said BJP had waged a war on Quran by resolving to abolish Nikkah Halala, a Muslim practice, and triple talaq. It was an attempt to alter the holy book of Muslims. When Supreme Court has declared triple talaq null and void, what was the need for a separate law, asked Mohideen adding that BJP wanted to put Muslim men behind bars so that their families suffered. By making Sanskrit compulsory in schools as mentioned in its manifesto, BJP had made its intentions of implementing one language, one religion and one tradition policy and spoiling the secular fabric of the country, he said. “IUML has two non-Muslim MLAs in Kerala. Besides, many of our members are from different religions and castes. Therefore, our presence in the secular progressive front is legitimate,” he said. BJP’s election manifesto was a repeat of its manifesto for the last parliamentary election. Some of the new points included the scrapping of special status to Jammu and Kashmir which would make the state more vulnerable, he said. BJP had insulted the court by making Ram temple construction in Ayodhya their poll promises, an issue which is sub judice, said Mohideen. When uniform civil code had been deemed undesirable by a committee headed by former Supreme Court judge B S Chauhan, BJP wanted to implement it and had made it its poll promise, Mohideen said.

The wicked practice of triple talaq was being used as a weapon to exploit them,” he said, addressing an election meeting in Aonla on Wednesday. “I want my Muslim sisters to recognize their real and true brothers. Women power must be respected,” he said. Attacking the Opposition, Adityanath said everyone saw how Rahul Gandhi went to file his nomination in Kerala in a procession where Indian and Congress party flags were missing but flags of Muslim League were present.

Ayyappa joins Ayodhya in matters of faith - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Implementation of the Supreme Court’s order allowing entry of women in the menstrual age into Kerala’s Sabarimala temple has muscled its way into BJP’s manifesto, with the party swearing by the tradition which bars women between 9 and 49 from entering the shrine of Lord Ayyappa. “We will undertake every effort to ensure that the subject of faith, tradition and worship rituals related to Sabarimala are presented in a comprehensive manner before the Supreme Court. We will endeavour to secure constitutional protection on issues related to faith and belief,” the manifesto said. The promise, with the party unhesitatingly amplifying its difference with the SC over the matter, is easily the most important component of the section titled ‘Cultural Heritage’ which makes mandatory reference to its stand to “explore all possibilities within the framework of the Constitution and all necessary efforts to facilitate expeditious construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya”. The section boldly signals its “exceptionalism” on cultural issues by proclaiming, “Since inception, the philosophy of BJP is anchored in the civilisational ethos of India. As we build ‘New India’, we intend to actively invest in strengthening our cultural roots and preserving civilisational continuity. Far from seeking our cultural roots as hurdles to progress, we see them as essential ingredients of our future.” Importantly, the promise to enact Uniform Civil Code forms part of the section on culture, even though the party has tried to pitch it as an issue of gender rights. The related theme of a legal ban on triple talaq and nikah halala figures in the section on women’s empowerment, though it too, like UCC, has been framed as a concern related to women’s welfare. The party has dealt with minorities with a single sentence: “We are committed to the empowerment and development with dignity of all minorities (Muslims, Christians, Sikhs Buddhists, Jains and Parsis)”.

Manifesto for Muslim women’s rights formed | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The Muslim Mahila Samvidhan Hak Parishad (MMSHP), a platform formed by like-minded Muslim woman activists, has generated a manifesto ahead of the polls. The parishad has demanded that the talaq bill, in its present form, be sent for review and practices of polygamy, halala and female circumcision be brought under a broader gender justice law. Razia Patel, the state convenor of MMSHP, said the parishad has been making these demands for quite some time and political parties should include these demands in their own manifestoes. “We demand that the present talaq bill be sent for a review to the law commission with inputs from women’s organization. Also, the current provisions like the Domestic Violence Act should be used against erring husbands. The gender justice laws should be strengthened by bringing Muslim women under its purview, instead of making special laws for them,” she added. The other demands include the installation quick courts to provide justice to Muslim women affected by communal riots in Gujarat, Muzaffarnagar and other places. The group said there was a need to implement Justice Sachar and Rangnath Mishra committee recommendations on education and employment. The group called for the repeal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, that seeks to give citizenship to non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Patel said the bill is clearly excluding the Muslim migrants. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Abusive husband gives triple talaq on phone, booked | Noida News - Times of India","NOIDA: A 29-year-old woman has alleged that her husband gave her triple talaq over the phone several times, before finally using the words before her family members. The woman, Nazmi, who got married to footwear showroom owner Atif (34) in 2008, has also alleged he beat her up and dashed her head against the wall, when she objected to him bringing other women to their house. Nazmi’s family has complained Atif and his father Siraj Khan used to torture her and repeatedly demanded money from her brother to start a business. Nazmi’s father Jeevan Khan, who is from Barola in Sector 49, said that they had given Rs 10 lakh to Atif’s family as dowry in 2008, but their demands never stopped. “Atif has a footwear showroom in Amroha and is a womaniser. My elder son is settled in Dubai; the younger one works in a company in Gurgaon. Atif, his father and one of his sisters, who is based in Delhi, would repeatedly taunt my daughter about her inadequate dowry and make demands for more money from us. Initially, my daughter kept things to herself, but we later got to know she was getting beaten up regularly,” he said. He also alleged that over the years, they have paid Atik a further Rs 5-6 lakh to broker peace, but to no avail. According to their complaint, filed with the Sector 49 police station, Jeevan, a nursery owner, paid Rs 50,000-Rs 1-2 lakh in multiple tranches so that Atif could set up his business. “Father-in-law Siraj and sister-in-law Shana Khan used to repeatedly taunt my daughter, throw her out of their home late at night. At times, along with me, Atif’s mother and younger sister would try to mediate, but to no avail, as Siraj and Shana backed him. Nazmi would slip out of their home, go to neighbours’ houses to make calls to us, but Atif stopped even that,” Jeevan said. According to the complainant, the situation got out of hands on June 5 2018, when Atif thrashed her and slammed her head against a wall. “She suffered serious injuries on her head. When we got to know about it, we were told Atif wanted divorce so that he could remarry. My daughter underwent treatment at Jaypee Hospital for her head injuries, and even suffered memory loss,” he said. Subsequently, the parents brought Nazmi to Barola, since when Atif has allegedly given her instant triple talaq four times. “At times, he would start a conversation on the phone with those words. We tried to pacify him, but then he would demand a Hyundai Creta SUV. Finally, on March 11, Atif arrived at our place with Siraj and Shana and gave Nazmi talaq in front of us,” he said. Police, who had earlier hoped for an arbitration, have now agreed to lodge an FIR against Atif. Sector 49 SHO Ajay Aggarwal said when they had contacted Atif, he had told them that he wanted Nazmi back, which Jeevan refuted, saying Atif had failed to turn up for a reconcilliation meeting called by the cops. “We’ve received a complaint and an FIR will be lodged shortly,” Aggarwal said.

Triple talaq debate divides women and men in western UP - Times of India,"MUZAFFARNAGAR/MEERUT: The issue of triple talaq is trapped in the gender binary that divides conservative Muslim society across western Uttar Pradesh, with many women giving the government a thumb's up for its efforts to criminalise the practice but shying away from voting for the BJP because of loyalty to their husbands. The she-says-maybe-he-says-nay syndrome may hinder the BJP from winning Muslim votes in the western Uttar Pradesh belt that goes to the polls in the first phase on April 11 as most men in the community say they don't want the government to interfere in their religion. Kaisar Jahan, a homemaker in Muzaffarnagar, typifies the dilemma of a woman caught between self-assertion and tradition that dictates she bows down to her husband. “Triple talaq is an atrocity which should definitely be criminalised. I like BJP for thinking about us,” said the mother of a six-year-old boy. She quickly added that she will not vote for the BJP as her husband does not want it to win. “I will vote where my husband wants me to. He does not want BJP, so I will not vote for it,” Kaisar told PTI while standing outside a shop. “Don't interfere in our religion. Keep politics out of it,” snapped her husband Aslam who came and took her away. The pattern was visible in Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Baghpat, which votes in phase one along with Saharanpur, Bijnor, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. Rabia, 35, resident of Kairana, said, ""Triple talaq is a wrong practice but we are not for the BJP. We will vote for anyone fielded by Akhilesh ji (SP chief Akhilesh Yadav) as my husband says."" About 35 per cent of the more than 1.5 crore voting in round one are Muslims, said J P S Rathore, vice president of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the BJP. Most Muslim women in the region hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing triple talaq under the spotlight, saying it was a step towards empowering Muslim women. Triple talaq, also known as 'talaq-e-biddat', is the practice of instant divorce in which a Muslim man can legally divorce his wife by pronouncing 'talaq' three times in one go. “My husband divorced me and married another woman. I had no choice but to accept the decision. I live with my four-year-old son now. Triple talaq is a heinous practice. Don't we Muslim women have rights?” asked Farzana, a resident of Muzaffarnagar. Her outrage found echo in the small town of Kairana nearby. Saba was divorced by her husband through triple talaq and is now living with her maternal family. ""My husband divorced me within two years of our marriage. I was just 18. We do not have any rights. I am illiterate may be that's why I could not fight. Luckily I did not have a child to look after. Triple talaq is a crime and men should not be allowed to do it,"" said an anguished Saba. While most of the women supported criminalising triple talaq, there were also women who felt their “Allah” would take care of everything and the government was trying to get in the way. Like 23-year-old Faiza, a resident of Baghpat who got married a year ago, and feels triple talaq is a “personal matter” which no political party should interfere in. In a landmark verdict, the apex court in August 2017 set aside the 1,400-year-old practice on several grounds, including that it was against the basic tenets of the Quran and violated the Shariat. The government issued a triple talaq ordinance in September 2018, making the practice a penal offence for Muslim men. Most Muslim men blame the BJP for polarisation of society and for interfering in Islam. If at all the government wants to do anything for Muslims, it should be to not incite violence, said many of the men. According to Faisal Khan, who runs a cigarette shop in Meerut, the Modi government made a “calculated political move” to win Muslim votes but it would not turn out that way. “Triple talaq is in our Islam. Who are they to interfere? We can take care of our women and don't need the government for it. We will not let BJP win again,” Khan said. Mohammad Aamir Arshad, 30, a truck driver with a transport company in Kairana, agreed with him. “All these years, the BJP polarised Hindus and Muslims. Now they are trying to divide men and women in Islam. They are showing that it is a very positive step but in fact it's only an interference in our religion,” Arshad said. Standing with him were five other Muslim men who voiced the same opinion. In Baghpat, a Muslim doctor added that religion is a private affair and the government has no role to play in it. “There are bigger issues to look at. Why are they getting into our personal issues. Our women are our responsibility. We will see what has to be done,” said Asad, a general physician. In 2014, all eight seats went to the BJP.

"Denied ticket, triple talaq victim says BJP favours chor ckowkidars | Bareilly News - Times of India","BAREILLY: Denied a party ticket to contest from Rampur, a triple talaq victim from Sambhal, Samina Begum, has lashed out at BJP for preferring a “chor chowkidar” (security guard who is a thief) as its candidate instead of a woman who has been fighting for the rights of hundreds of other victim. The party has fielded Jaya Prada from Rampur. Samina claimed that she had met BJP’s top leadership, seeking ticket but was denied.

On March 17, she told reporters that talks were underway with BJP leadership and soon, the party would declare her candidature from Rampur. She accused BJP of misleading public and never fulfilling its promises — be it Ram temple issue or the matter relating to triple talaq. Samina termed Jaya Prada as an opportunist who enjoyed the status of a Samajwadi Party MP for 10 years and now switched sides to join BJP.

" Promise law against lynching, Muslim women urge parties | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Muslim women associated with grassroots networks from 10 states came together to launch a manifesto of demands from political parties ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, calling for a law to deal with mob lynching and hate crimes in the light of what they said was a growing insecurity among minorities. The demand comes in the backdrop the manifesto released by women organisations which says that “the state must take cognizance of these hate crimes, and ensure compensation and legal support to the survivors”. They cite the SC judgment of July, 2018 where the top court warned against rule of mob and called for measures to curb cow vigilantism and lynchings. “State governments be reminded of its ‘sacrosanct duty’ to protect its citizens from lynch mobs and Parliament enact a special law against vigilante violence, and should follow the directives of the court to appoint local officers in order to monitor targeted violence,” stated the demand charter. “Introduce a Communal Violence Bill to bring (state) sponsors and perpetrators to justice,” it said. The press conference on Wednesday saw some women relate their experiences such as the case of mob lynching at Alwar of Umar Khan who was killed in 2017. His wife said she did not want anyone to go through such an experience. While registering their support for ending the practice of triple talaq, the women’s groups led by Bebaak Collective opposed the criminalisation provisions prescribing a three-year jail term for the husband under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2019. They want the ordinance scrapped. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"I will change how party is perceived, says BJP Muslim candidate from West Bengal | Kolkata News - Times of India","KOLKATA: From being a BJP primary member in 2017 to being the first Muslim woman to contest Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal for the saffron party, Mafuja Khatun’s political journey has not been easy. As a BJP leader who had switched over from CPM, Mafuja had to put up a fight to be accepted across communities. The former CPM MLA from Kumarganj in Dakshin Dinajpur joined BJP in 2017. “It was not a sudden decision and I was ready for the challenges ahead. But it was not the same BJP that we used to be critical about earlier. You need to be an insider to understand the party,” she said. “We have never seen any leader speaking against minority communities even during indoor meetings. I will share my experience with the voters to change the perception a section of the community has about the party,” Mafuja added. Mafuja was first made an invitee member of the state committee. Gradually, she started getting noticed by the party’s Bengal leaders for her organizational skills. She was appointed vice president of the state unit of Minority Morcha in the next six months. While the first Muslim woman to contest Lok Sabha polls on a BJP ticket (from Dhubri, Assam) was Jebin Borhuyan, Khatun is the first such from Bengal. The decision to nominate her came after a prominent Bengal BJP leader wrote to party bosses in New Delhi advocating representation for Muslim women in the state. While Mafuja is from Kumarganj, her close connection with Murshidabad started last year after she was made observer of Behrampore. BJP has been gradually making inroads in Jangipur over the years. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, both Congress and CPM had witnessed a large decline (20.4 % and 7.45% respectively) in vote share in Jangipur, while BJP had bagged 8.65% votes (a rise of 6.32%). “Instant triple talaq has been an issue that has had an impact on Muslim women. There are around 2 lakh women in Murshidabad who have been a victim to that,” said Hossain Ali, president of BJP’s Minority Morcha. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Triple talaq victim seeks BJP ticket to contest from Rampur | Bareilly News - Times of India,"BAREILLY: Triple talaq victim and women’s rights activist Shamina Begum on Sunday said that she wants to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from Rampur on a BJP ticket. Interestingly, the Sambhal resident had earlier shown her intention to contest polls as an independent candidate. Now, Shamina said that she had written a letter to BJP president Amit Shah seeking time to meet him. “The BJP is the only political party which had been supporting me during my struggle so far,” Shamina said, adding that she wants to support the party by contesting polls. This, she said, would also help her raise issues related to triple talaq more effectively, especially if elected as an MP in the future. “I believe BJP will support me again. I will be able to secure the party’s symbol from Rampur, where my paternal residence is located. This is a golden opportunity for BJP to show its opponents and voters the intention to fight for triple talaq victims and the cause,” she also said. Notably, on March 12, when Shamina made an announcement that she would contest the elections as an independent candidate, she had criticised the BJP for using triple talaq victims for its political gain.

However, when she was in India, he sent her a WhatsApp message saying that he has already divorced her. “I did triple talaq already (sic),” he said in a message to her. Farah said that she had received the message a few months ago. She now plans to lodge a police complaint against Siddiqui. In the Whatsapp message that they had exchanged, he had also asked her to file a case against him if she wanted to. It was after she got the WhatsApp message that she travelled to the US, only to be stopped by the immigration authorities in San Francisco on February 12. “I did not take the message seriously although I knew he was having an affair with another woman,” she said. “I wanted to spend my wedding anniversary with him on March 18 and for this reason, I travelled to the US but I was shocked to know that I was divorced. There were no divorce papers signed,” she said. Triple talaq is illegal in India and the man who divorces his wife that way can be punished with a jail term of three years.

BJP uses triple talaq ordinance to win over Muslim women | Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, the state unit of the BJP conducted a survey among Muslim women voters to ascertain the popularity of the Union government’s ordinance against triple talaq. The survey was conducted in constituencies in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Vellore districts with significant number of Muslim women. It was aimed at assessing support for the BJP among Muslim women, and how it would translate into votes. The survey is significant as more than 10 of the 39 LS constituencies in Tamil Nadu have substantial Muslim voters with a high percentage of women among them. It’s a two-question survey, which was carried out by a private firm two weeks ago among 2,000 Muslim women. To the first question on their sentiment about the Triple Talaq ordinance, 24% of the women expressed “happiness” and 42% said they felt “secure”. The remaining 34% said the ordinance went against their religion. As many as 1,540 women said “no comments” while responding to the second question on whether they wanted to vote for Modi. A total of 460, accounting for 23%, said they would not vote for Modi. “The survey vindicates our stand that majority of the Muslim women are pleased with the Modi government and support the ordinance that prevented instant divorce and ensured their security,” said a BJP functionary, seeking anonymity. “Though 77% of the participant refused to answer the question on whether they would vote for Modi, we are hoping that a substantial percent of them will surely exercise their franchise in favour of the NDA,” he said. “It will be a powerful election campaign tool for us in social media,” he added. It would give the NDA an edge as the Congress-led UPA has said it would scrap the ordinance if it won the LS polls. “The Congress leadership took the stand to appease the Muslim parties, but women are a majority in the community across the country. This will reflect in the election and bring us a sizeable number of votes,” said the BJP leader. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

" Question your Rajya Sabha MPs over low productivity, PM Modi urges youth | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday took a dig at the opposition over the Rajya Sabha’s low productivity and urged the youth to question members of the Upper House belonging to their states on their performance. He asserted that such questioning would lead to nationwide pressure on them. The opposition parties have a numerical advantage over the ruling NDA in Rajya Sabha. It has resulted in blocking of many proposed legislations, including the one on banning the practice of instant triple talaq and the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, in the Upper House. Addressing the “National Youth Parliament Festival”, Modi suggested youngsters organise events upon returning home and invite Rajya Sabha members from their states as chief guests and ask questions on their performance and productivity during the Parliament sessions. He said the productivity of the outgoing 16th Lok Sabha, where the government enjoys a big majority, was 85% (20% more than the previous Lok Sabha) and it passed 205 bills. He attributed such performance of the Lower House to the full majority of the BJP in the 2014 general elections. He, however, expressed concern over only 8% productivity of the Rajya Sabha in the last session where the interim budget was passed. The Prime Minister, on the occasion, also advised the participants to visit the country’s National War Memorial adjoining the iconic India Gate complex, inaugurated by him on Monday, and the National Police Memorial in central Delhi. “Visit to these two locations will fill you with inspiration and enthusiasm to contribute towards nation building,” he told the participants.

triple talaq:   Ordinance on triple talaq gets 3rd time govt nod | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Cabinet gave its nod on Tuesday for re-promulgation of the ordinance on triple talaq, which makes the practice of instant divorce by Muslim men a penal offence with provisions for certain rights of the victim. This is the third time that the government will bring in the ordinance, as the bill, passed by the Lok Sabha, could not pass the Rajya Sabha hurdle and is set to lapse once the Lower House is dissolved. “The proposed ordinance will protect the rights of married Muslim women and prevent divorce by the practice of instantaneous and irrevocable ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by their husbands,” a government release said.

The ordinance is only applicable to incidents of instant triple talaq and not on talaq followed according to Sharia with the prescribed waiting period before a divorce is allowed.

 SC: New govt has to work afresh on lapsed Citizenship and triple talaq bills | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said the lapsing of citizenship bill and triple talaq bill would require the new government after general elections to make a fresh effort if it wants to revive the legislative action. This example was cited by a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna when it was pressed by petitioner and former law minister Ashwani Kumar that the SC needed to nudge the government to complete the process to enact a standalone law against custodial torture as the groundwork was completed when Lok Sabha passed a bill in 2010 and the select committee, to which Rajya Sabha had referred the bill, opined in favour of enacting the law. The CJI-led bench said, “Yesterday (Wednesday), two bills, on triple talaq and citizenship issues, lapsed. The process has to start afresh when a new government takes over in May after the general elections. Similar is the case with the bill on custodial torture. Since it has lapsed, the government has to begin the exercise again. “The Union government does not say it will not enact a law. It says that it has collated views of state governments and is studying it to take further action. Whether there should be a law or not, we cannot decide or direct the government. The very fact that despite the lapse of the 2010 bill, it has remained a live issue is a sufficient indication that the government is working on it.” However, it reserved verdict on Kumar’s PIL seeking guidelines to prevent custodial torture till Parliament enacted a law. The National Human Rights Commission, through advocate Shobha, and amicus curiae Colin Gonsalves, who was told by the bench on Wednesday not to be partisan while assisting the court on the issue, unequivocally supported the former law minister’s demand for a standalone law against custodial torture and came out against amendment to Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code. All three cited the Law Commission’s recommendation supporting a standalone law. However, the Centre through attorney general K K Venugopal had said the government was engaged in collating the views of state governments, which had sole jurisdiction over police as well as law and order. Since the law on custodial torture will affect these two subjects, the views of state governments assume importance, he had said and requested the court not to direct the government or Parliament to enact a law.

The Triple Talaq Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on December 27 last year with 245 votes in favour and 11 against the Bill. The opposition parties want the Bill to be sent to the Select Committee of Parliament for further vetting, a demand rejected by the Centre.

The Bill criminalises the practice of instant triple talaq with a provision of three years imprisonment to the erring husband.

In a landmark 3-2 verdict, the apex court found the practice un-Islamic and ""arbitrary"", and disagreed that triple talaq was an integral part of religious practice.

" ‘If courts are vigilant, liberties will be safe’ | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Courts have to be extremely vigilant to what is happening in society, only then citizens will be safe, said Supreme Court judge Dhananjay Chandrachud on Saturday. He was responding to a college student during an interactive session at the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival. The student said if dissent was a right and a ""safety valve of democracy"", persons who voiced their opinion risked facing sedition charges. ""We are termed anti-national,"" said Hargun Kaur, a student of Mithibai College. Justice Chandrachud said, ""It is important that courts have to be extremely vigilant to what is happening in society. I believe courts are vigilant. We have an extremely important role.'' He added that citizens must believe courts will stand up for their rights. He cited the example of how the SC also hears bail or anticipatory bail pleas and looks at such matters carefully. ""This (SC) is the ultimate frontier,"" he said. ""When you deny bail to somebody who is a citizen, the fundamental democratic value is at stake. Courts have an important restraining influence on State power,'' he added Justice Chandrachud, part of major judgments, including right to privacy, decriminalising of same sex relationships and adultery, and the striking down of triple talaaq, said judges have to be vigilant, right from district courts, the first common interface with citizens. ""So long as judges are vigilant, liberties will be safe,'' he said. Justice Chandrachud, at KGAF to talk on 'And Justice For More Section 377 (unnatural offences)', was asked if now that the Section was decriminalised, would courts be responsive to newer issues, including marriage, equal inheritance, adoption and property rights for the LGBTQ population.

 Law minister slams Congress for opposing bill banning triple talaq | India News - Times of India,"MOTIHARI: Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday slammed the Congress for opposing the legislation against triple talaq saying, the party was supporting a social practice that has been banned in more than 20 Islamic countries. Addressing a farmers' congregation in East Champaran district, Prasad alleged that under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi the Congress was continuing with the politics of minority appeasement, unlike the motto of 'sabka saath sabka vikas' of the Narendra Modi government. ""Rahul Gandhi seems to be following the path taken by his father Rajiv Gandhi in the Shah Bano case. Does he realize that triple talaq undermines the dignity of Muslim woman"", Prasad asked. ""Is he aware that this form of instant divorce has been outlawed in as many as 22 Islamic countries. Why can then India not have a law banning this retrograde social practice,"" Prasad said. Notably, in the 1980s, the Supreme Court had ruled that a divorced Muslim woman was entitled to alimony which was vehemently opposed by a section of Islamic clerics which alleged that the verdict amounted to interference with the Muslim Personal Law. A law was subsequently enacted in Parliament by the Rajiv Gandhi government overturning the Supreme Court judgement drawing sharp criticism from a section of Muslim women, as also opposition parties like the BJP which accused the ruling Congress of indulging in minority appeasement ahead of the general elections of 1989. The Congress has been opposing the triple talaq legislation brought by the Modi government in Parliament after the practice was declared ultra vires of the Constitution by the Supreme Court. The Congress, along with a number of other opposition parties, has held that the bill against triple talaq which made instant divorce punishable with imprisonment for a period of up to three years was arbitrary. A fresh controversy has, however, arisen following a statement by Sushmita Dey, the chief of Congress women's wing, on Thursday that the party would scrap legislation banning triple talaq if it is voted to power in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. ""The Modi government believes in taking all sections of the society along and ensuring the progress of all. This includes Muslims and women and therefore we have brought this law,"" Prasad said. In an apparent reference to the Rafale fighter plane controversy, he alleged that under pressure from big powers in the world, the Indian air force was not allowed to have its own fleet of fighter aircraft for about 30 years. ""We have tried to change that,"" he said. Those casting an evil eye on the Indian territory got a befitting reply in the form of surgical strikes. In less than five years, the Modi government has built more toilets and given more gas connections than the previous governments did in several decades, the Union minister said. It is the Modi government which introduced close to 100 schemes for giving a boost to dairy farming and fisheries besides guaranteeing an assistance of Rs 6000 per year to poor farmers, he said. ""And our schemes are implemented transparently and efficiently. Rajiv Gandhi had spoken about only 15 paise of every rupee spent by the government reaching the people. Modi government has done away with middlemen with direct cash transfers,"" he added. The three-day event 'Kisan Kumbh' which will conclude on Monday was inaugurated by Bihar Governor Lalji Tandon. Others who spoke on the occasion included deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

If UP brings BJP back to power, all intruders will be ousted. The process has already been initiated in Assam."" Targeting Congress for promising to repeal the law banning triple talaq, Shah said, ""Muslim women also have honour, deserve respect and the right to equality like other women in the country. We won't let that happen."" ""Despite having a glorious past, UP got backward state tag after successive regimes of SP and BSP who divided people on caste lines.

Land mafia has been checked and land worth crores of rupees recovered from them,” said Shah. Terming the opposition alliance as a ‘thugbandhan’ (alliance of thugs), Shah told party workers not to get worried of SP-BSP alliance, and said, “Ensure BJP victory on 74 Lok Sabah seats, including Amethi.” Urging the party workers to work hard and ensure 51% vote share for BJP, Shah said that they can wipe out the alliance by conveying PM Modi’s message to each household. He told them to go to people and inform them about the successful implementation of 129 development projects and benefits of Modi government’s schemes. “The coming election will be a battle between BJP, which wants to see India at top position, and the corrupt who have united in fear of Modi, Shah further added.” Shah also praised the government for giving 10% reservation to poor of forward castes. “BJP is determined to construct a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. Congress had acquired land of Ram Janma Bhoomi Nyas. On the appeal of Nyas, PM Modi decided to give it back. The Yogi government got more than 1 lakh documents translated in six months but Congress is creating hurdles in court,” he added. Shah said, “SP chief is asking what has PM Narendra Modi done for UP in last four and half years. We are accountable to people and we will give them account in detail. Before asking PM, Akhilesh and Mayawati should tell what did UP get in 10 years of UPA regime which they supported.” He asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh and Mayawati to clarify whether temple should be constructed at Lord Ram’s birth place or not.

 ‘Does Bareilly nikah halala not shock your conscience?’ | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Citing a recent incident in Bareilly where a Muslim woman was “raped” by her kin twice under the practice of ‘nikah halala’, Union minister Arun Jaitely on Friday decried Congress’ promise to scrap the ban on triple talaq and accused Rahul Gandhi of taking a retrograde step to “drive Muslim women not only into destitution but also to live a life which is an antithesis of human existence”. In a blog, Jaitley said the recent case from Bareilly, which relates to the “obnoxious” practice of ‘nikah halala’ in Islamic personal law, shocked his conscience.

"Don’t intervene in Triple Talaq law just for votes, Muslim scholars to Rahul Gandhi | Agra News - Times of India","AGRA: A day after the Congress announced to scrap the Triple Talaq law if it was voted to power in Lok Sabha polls, a group of Muslim intellectuals in Aligarh wrote to party chief Rahul Gandhi urging him not to intervene or scrap this law for votes. In a letter to Rahul Gandhi, Islamic scholar and national president of Bhartiya Samaj Sevak Sangathan (BSSS), Chaudhary Ifrahim Hussain, said, “If you are really concerned about the welfare of the Muslim community then implement the recommendations of the SACHAR committee report, restore the minority character of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), give equal rights to Muslims that were deprived of by the Congress party and remove the religious ban on Dalit-Muslim reservation.” He added that the Congress will not get the support of the community just by announcing its intent to scrap the triple talaq law. “This bill was passed to end Talaq-e-biddat or instant triple talaq on the directions of the apex court with the suggestions of ulema (a body of Muslim scholars who are recognized as having specialist knowledge of Islamic sacred law and theology),” he said, adding that this was required to end this crime. Talking to TOI, Hussain said that punishment is required for preventing any crime and triple talaq should be considered a crime. “This law is not against the community, in fact it provides justice to women.

" No triple talaq bill if Cong wins polls, says MP | India News - Times of India","Triggering a row, Mahila Congress chief and MP Sushmita Dev said the triple talaq bill was a tool that pitted Muslim men and women against each other and that the law would be scrapped if Congress was voted to power. The MP said Congress opposed the bill as it is a weapon PM Modi wanted to use to put Muslim men in jail. Dev, Lok Sabha MP from Silchar, also said Congress had received ""crores of letters"" from Muslim women who carried out signature campaigns and rebelled against the proposed law and that the party had opposed the law in Parliament based on this. ""I promise you people that when the Congress government comes to power in 2019, we will scrap this law. But it is also a given that any law that is brought for empowerment of women, by whichever government, will have Congress' support,"" Dev said. Even as her unilateral dismissal of the proposed law appeared to contradict Congress's previous, more nuanced position, on the subject, the party's media managers rushed to clarify that Dev's statement was only a reiteration of Congress's stated position that penal provisions in the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, must be dropped. Asserting that Congress had opposed instant triple talaq even before it was struck down as illegal by the Supreme Court - where Congress lawyers appeared pro bono for some affected women - the party emphasised its opposition to passage of the triple talaq bill was on the ground that it did not answer the crucial question of how a man would provide for or maintain a woman and her children from within the confines of a jail. ""Congress's position has been clear that this bill cannot be used as a tool to deprive a woman and her family of maintenance. Modiji has not responded to these concerns raised by Congress, and it is for this reason that we opposed the bill,"" party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. In December 2018, the government have moved a fresh bill in Lok Sabha to make triple talaq a penal offence resulting in a jail term of three years for the husband.

Addressing the party's minority department convention, she also alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had created an atmosphere pitting Muslim women against Muslim men through the law.  With the triple talaq bill continuing to face resistance in the Rajya Sabha, the central government issued an ordinance in September last year, incorporating certain amendments. The ordinance was re-promulgated last month as the first one was about to expire. ""Look at the audacity of Mr Rahul Gandhi?

Since the bill could not get the parliamentary approval, the fresh ordinance was issued on January 13. The Union Cabinet had before that approved the re-issuance of the ordinance. Seeking to allay fears that the proposed law could be misused, the government has included certain safeguards in it such as adding a provision of bail for the accused before trial. These amendments were cleared by the Cabinet on August 29, 2018. The government has maintained that despite the Supreme Court striking down the practice of talaq-e-biddat (instant triple talaq) as unconstitutional, men were divorcing their wives on flimsy grounds and even via WhatsApp. The opposition has said divorce cannot be made a penal offence and the provisions of the bill are against basic principles of the Constitution.

The bill provides for according Indian citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh after six years stayin India.
