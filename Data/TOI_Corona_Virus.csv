"Odisha: Back from China, youth in hospital over coronavirus scare | Bhubaneswar News - Times of India","BERHAMPUR: A 25-year-old youth from Phulbani in Kandhamal district, studying in a medical college in China, has voluntarily got himself admitted to the district headquarters hospital after complaining of fever and cold. Mrutunjay Muni, a medical student at Southwest Medical University in the Sichuan province of China, returned home to Phulbani on January 12. A few days ago he complained of fever and cough and cold, initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus (nCoV), which has resulted in more than 200 deaths in China and has forced the World Health Organisation to declare it a global emergency. “After returning from China, I started feeling feverish. I also had cough and cold. Given that coronavirus is spreading in China and the symptoms matched that of the deadly disease, I voluntarily went for a health check-up at the district headquarters hospital in Phulbani,” said Muni, who has been referred to SCB Hospital and Medical College in Cuttack. Muni said he stays in a town close to Wuhan, the epicentre of coronavirus. “The youth has been kept under observation in the isolation ward. Arrangements are being made to shift him to SCB,” said Rajashree Patnaik, chief district medical officer (CDMO), Kandhamal. The hospital in Phulbani has set up a three-bedded isolation ward to deal with coronavirus patients. The CDMO said there was no need to panic as Muni had returned to India much before the outbreak of the virus in China. “The blood samples of the patient will be sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for tests,” she added. Santosh Mishra, superintendent of MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur, urged those who returned from China to report for a health check-up. “We request those who have returned from China to undergo a basic health check-up. They should voluntarily come to hospital,” said Mishra, adding that a 10-bedded isolation ward has been set up at MKCG. Apart from Muni, several youths from Silk City have returned home from China given that this is the time of the Chinese New year celebrations. T Vijya Kumar Patra (25), who works as a junior scientist in a pharmaceutical company at Zibo in China, returned to Berhampur on January 25. “The spread of the disease was not that severe when I returned home. I was screened at the Kolkata airport after landing there,” said Patra, adding that he would return to China only after the disease is brought under control. T Gopi, father of Kumar, said his son did not visit the hospital for a health check-up as he did not show symptoms of the deadly virus. Basudev Paul (31), a research scientist, associated with a company in Shanghai, China, was supposed to return this week and join work on Friday. But he was forced to cancel his flight owing to the spread of the virus. Radhakant Gouda (37), another research scientist, is supposed to return to Beijing on February 15 but has now put his trip on hold. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
China expands lockdowns to 25 million people to halt viral outbreak - Times of India,"BEIJING: China broadened its unprecedented, open-ended lockdowns to encompass around 25 million people Friday to try to contain a deadly new virus that has sickened hundreds, though the measures' potential for success is uncertain. At least eight cities have been shut down — Wuhan, Ezhou, Huanggang, Chibi, Qianjiang, Zhijiang, Jingmen and Xiantao — all in central China's Hubei province, where the illness has been concentrated. Wuhan, which has the majority of cases, also announced Friday that it will build a designated hospital with space for 1,000 beds in the style of a facility that Beijing constructed during the SARS epidemic. The hospital will be erected on a 25,000 square-meter lot and is slated for completion Feb. 3, municipal authorities said. The lockdown began early Thursday in Wuhan, where normally bustling streets, malls and other public spaces were eerily quiet. Masks were mandatory in public. Train stations, the airport and subways were closed; police checked incoming vehicles but did not close off roads. The seven other cities under lockdown as of Friday morning are near Wuhan, but authorities were taking precautions around the country. In the capital, Beijing, major public events were canceled indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of Lunar New Year celebrations. The Forbidden City, the palace complex in Beijing, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday. The number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus rose to 830, the National Health Commission said Friday morning. Twenty-six people have died. The first deaths outside Hubei were confirmed. The health commission in Hebei, a northern province bordering Beijing, said an 80-year-old man died after returning from a two-month stay in Wuhan to see relatives. Heilongjiang in the northeast also said one person died in the province, but did not give further details. The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or people with connections the city. Outside the mainland, cases have been confirmed in Hong Kong, Macao, the United States, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam. Many countries are screening travelers from China for symptoms of the virus, which can cause fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and pneumonia. The World Health Organization decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency for now. The declaration can increase resources to fight a threat but that can also cause trade and travel restrictions and other economic damage, making the decision politically fraught. The decision ""should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we're not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth,"" WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day."" Chinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's Communist Party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. And the effectiveness of such measures is unclear. Jonathan Ball, a professor of virology at molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said the lockdowns appear to be justified scientifically. ""Until there's a better understanding of what the situation is, I think it's not an unreasonable thing to do,"" he said. ""Anything that limits people's travels during an outbreak would obviously work."" But Ball cautioned that any such quarantine should be strictly time-limited. He added: ""You have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. Otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people."" The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels. The first cases in the Wuhan outbreak late last month were connected to a seafood market, and experts suspect transmission began from wild animals sold there. The market is closed for investigation.

"China virus death toll mounts to 25, infections spread - Times of India","BEIJING: A new coronavirus has killed 25 people in China and infected more than 800, the government said on Friday, as the World Health Organisation declared it an emergency but stopped short of declaring the epidemic of international concern. China's National Health Commission said 830 cases had been confirmed so far and 25 people had died as of Thursday. Most of the cases are in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated late last year. Non-fatal cases have been found in at least seven other countries. Health officials fear the transmission rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday. Nonetheless, it was a ""bit too early"" to consider the outbreak a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern,"" WHO Emergency Committee panel chair Didier Houssin said after the body met in Geneva. Such a designation would have required countries to step up the international response. ""Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""It has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one,"" he said. Scrambling to contain the outbreak, the local government in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province, suspended most transport on Thursday, including outgoing flights, and people were told not to leave. Hours later, neighbouring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, announced similar measures. ""The lockdown of 11 million people is unprecedented in public health history,"" said Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in Beijing. The organization said, however, that it was not yet recommending any broader restrictions on travel or trade. The previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan. It has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns surrounding it. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. There is no vaccine for the virus, which can spread through respiratory transmission. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing.

Condemning the Union government’s attempt to promote quackery in the name of alternative medicine, Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations (FIRA) president Narendra Nayak said: “When all the authorities including World Health Organisation claim there is neither any vaccine nor any treatment for Coronavirus, the government is promoting unproven therapies to lull people into a false sense of security that they can be safe if they consume such concoctions.” FIRA members also questioned the silence of medical bodies on “this blatant falsehood”. AYUSH ministry, in a health advisory, had recommended that homeopathic and unani medicines could be effective in the prevention of Coronavirus infections.

Bizmen fear losses after corona virus outbreak in China | Ludhiana News - Times of India,"Ludhiana: The outbreak of corona virus in China has dented business prospects of some local businessmen, who are frequent travellers to that country for importing goods from that country. A variety of goods, including electronics, sanitary products, rubber products, etc. are imported in huge numbers from China here every month. Spreading of this epidemic has not only put brakes on the travel plans of businessmen to China but at the same time they are anticipating high losses if the situation is not controlled immediately. Giving more information, Ankit Sahni, a city-based importer, said, “After the reports of spread of corona virus in China, I have cancelled my visit to Guangzhou. Due to the last minute cancellation, I will have to bear losses on account of cancellation of my air ticket and forfeiture of my hotel booking. Besides this, it is going to cost me dear as I was going to China to finalise a deal of import of tyres and now, I will have to wait until the situation improves there.” According to Sanjeev Sharma, an auto parts importer, “Wuhan, which is said to be the epicentre of the corona virus, is one of the largest industrial hubs of China and there is a huge number of automotive component factories located there. The outbreak of the deadly virus has already started casting its shadow on business as since Monday, we are unable to contact one of our prominent suppliers, who is based in Wuhan. If the epidemic is not controlled, along with the mounting loss of lives, it will also lead to huge losses for both businessmen in China and those who trade with them.” According to Ravi Kant Chabra, another importer based in Ludhiana, “This corona virus problem is evident from the fact that how hard it is now to do international business. Spreading of such epidemics not only makes travelling and doing business in such countries impossible but at the same time it also has its side effects like temporary closure of trade or stringent checking of consignments, which in turn causes delays in shipments, eventually resulting in heavy losses for us.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Hospitals on corona alert, two Gurugram residents show symptoms | Gurgaon News - Times of India","GURUGRAM: Two city residents who returned from China recently have been admitted to the isolation ward of the Civil hospital with novel coronavirus-like symptoms, prompting the district health department to issue an alert on Friday. Civil doctors said the body fluid samples of the two have been sent to Pune’s National Institute of Virology (NIV). Civil hospital’s epidemic in-charge Dr Ram Prakash Rai said the two men — a 31-year-old DLF-1 resident and a 35-year-old Sushant Lok-1 resident — self-reported to the government hospital with fever and respiratory problems after returning from China. “Both the male patients are suspected of being affected by the coronavirus. They are kept under observation at the isolation ward of the hospital. Their fluid samples have been sent to NIV. Fortunately, their family members have not shown any viral symptoms. However, we are monitoring them as well,” Dr Rai said. As there is no cure for the novel coronavirus yet, Dr Rai said, doctors are giving medication to the patients to boost their immunity to fight the infection. “In the wake of the two suspected cases, the health department has sent an alert to all the hospitals in the district,” he added. Novel coronavirus is an umbrella term for viruses that cause illnesses ranging from common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but it has claimed the lives of over 200 people in China. India reported its first case of the novel coronavirus in Kerala on Thursday. Doctors are of the opinion that humans can contract coronavirus by coming into contact with the secretions of an infected person — such as via sneezing, handshake or cough. “So we are advising people to stay indoors in isolation if they are suffering from cold or fever,” Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, Gurugram, told TOI.

Chinese no longer welcome as coronavirus fear grips world - Times of India,"Airlines halt flights from China. Schools in Europe uninvite exchange students. Restaurants in South Korea turn away Chinese customers. As a deadly virus spreads beyond China, governments, businesses and educational institutions are struggling to find the right response. Safeguarding public health is a priority. How to do that without stigmatizing the entire population of the country where the outbreak began is the challenge. With the death toll reaching 170 and the roster of cases climbing above 7,700, worries are growing. Many global companies with operations in China have asked workers to stay home. Airlines are curtailing flights to the nation. Several countries have begun evacuating citizens from the most stricken zone around the city of Wuhan. Though the vast majority of cases involve people from the central Chinese metropolis or nearby cities, or those who have been in contact with them, people of Asian appearance around the world say they've been subject to increased wariness since the disease began spreading. In some cases, baser emotions have come to the fore. In South Korea, signs have begun popping up on restaurant windows saying, ""no Chinese allowed."" A Korean casino catering to foreign visitors said it's no longer accepting groups of tourists from China. More than half a million people signed a petition, submitted to the government, calling for a ban on visitors from the nearby country of 1.4 billion. A Chinese woman visiting the Japanese city of Ito -- on a peninsula south of Tokyo -- said that a server at a restaurant shouted ""Chinese! Out!"" at her, according to a recording shared on a Weibo account. The recording, which included a subsequent phone call to the unnamed eatery, was shared by a reporter from Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV. A woman who answered the phone at the restaurant said it was refusing customers from China and Southeast Asia because the owner was worried about the coronavirus, according to the recording. ""If our owner contracts the virus and dies, whose responsibility is it then?"" she said. Health concerns aside, the reaction in South Korea and Japan to the virus reflects longstanding friction with China, as well as resentment over its growing influence in the region. That's even as an influx of visitors from China has boosted neighboring economies, including South Korea, where tourists surged by a quarter to more than 5.5 million through November from the previous year. Signs of insensitivity aren't limited to Asia. French regional newspaper Courrier Picard sparked outrage with its headline ""Yellow Alert"" on a front-page story about the coronavirus. The paper apologized to readers who took to Twitter to condemn the allusion to ""Yellow Peril,"" a xenophobic term referring to the peoples of East Asia that dates to the 19th century. In Denmark, the Chinese Embassy called on the country's Jyllands-Posten newspaper to apologize for an editorial cartoon that depicts China's flag with virus symbols instead of stars on a red background. ""We feel angry and we feel sad because it's a kind of insult to our people and to our flag,"" John Liu, Secretary General at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Denmark, said in a television interview. The paper declined to apologize, citing Denmark's tradition of freedom of speech. Those of Chinese descent, but not from China, have also been met with harsh reactions. In Sri Lanka, a group of tourists from Singapore - a Southeast Asian country where the majority of people are of Chinese descent - were barred from climbing local attraction Ella Rock because of their appearance, according to Tucker Chang, 66, one of the tourists. No one in the group had a history of recent travel to China. Student visitsIn France, the ministry of foreign affairs advised schools and universities to postpone student exchanges with China. At least one high school in Paris withdrew invitations to a group of students set to arrive this week. In Canada, parents in communities north of Toronto started a petition urging schools to force students who recently returned from China to stay home for at least 17 days to avoid any chance of spreading the disease. The petition has garnered almost 10,000 signatures in the area, which has large ethnic-Chinese and Asian populations. In response, York school board chair Juanita Nathan and education director Louise Sirisko have written to parents advising them that such requests run the risk of ""demonstrating bias and racism,"" even when made in the name of safety. ""What we're really trying to get at is to [make sure] this situation is not giving rise to any inadvertent racism,"" Nathan told CBC Radio's Metro Morning.

Coronavirus death toll hits 56; health officials say virus' ability to spread getting stronger - Times of India,"BEIJING: Scientists in China are ramping up efforts to develop a vaccine against the deadly coronavirus as the death toll on Sunday rose sharply to 56 and the number of people infected with the SARS-like virus expected to reach 3,000, prompting authorities to expand travel lockdown to contain the epidemic. The mayor of Hubei province's capital Wuhan, a city of about 11 million and the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed 56 and infected 1,975 people, on Sunday said he expects another 1,000 new patients in the city, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Zhou Xianwang said ""it was possible to add about 1,000 cases"" based on the number of patients in hospital being tested or undergoing observation in the city. Premier Li Keqiang will head the high-level group to fight the coronavirus epidemic as health officials said the virus's ability to spread is getting stronger. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Sunday that researchers had isolated viruses and were selecting a strain, Xu Wenbo, a director of CDC's virus institute, told South China Morning Post. Xu at a press conference in Beijing said that researchers had used high-throughput genetic sequencing to identify pathogens one day after the first four samples were sent from Wuhan on January 2. China's National Health Commission (NHC) on Sunday said that the new coronavirus is contagious even in its incubation period, which lasts up to 14 days, and that the virus' ability to spread is getting stronger, the Hong Kong-based daily reported. Ma Xiaowei, the minister in charge of the NHC, told a press briefing that the authorities' understanding of the virus was “limited” and they were also unclear on the risks posed by possible mutations. “The outbreak is expected to continue for some time,” he was quoted as saying. Ma said that unlike Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the new coronavirus was infectious during its incubation period. He also reiterated earlier reports that people infected with the virus might not immediately show any symptoms. While Wuhan and 17 others cities in Hubei province remained the epicentre of the viral disease outbreak with most of the deaths having taken place there, the cases have started rising steadily in most of the Chinese provinces and cities, including Beijing. Originating Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and across the world - with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries as distant as the United States. The US, France and Russia are preparing to pull their citizens out of Wuhan. Other countries are ramping up quarantine measures in an attempt to prevent further infections in their own territories. India on Sunday said it is examining ""all options"" in consultations with China to provide relief to over 250 stuck Indians, mostly students, in Wuhan. India on Sunday opened a third hotline in view of ""large number"" of phone calls from the Indians who are mostly students, the Indian Embassy in Beijing said.

""Over the last two days our hotlines have fielded nearly 600 calls to respond to concerns regarding this difficult situation. GoI and @EOIBeijing are also examining all options, including through consultations with the Chinese authorities, to provide relief to our affected citizens,"" another tweet by the Embassy said. The reference to “all options” was seen as a pointer to explore the option to evacuate the stranded Indians. In a rare move, the Indian Embassy here on Sunday cancelled the Republic Day ceremony, owing to the rising concern of the virus which has spread to all provinces except Tibet.

Authorities have prevented anyone from leaving Wuhan,   the city of 11 million people   at the heart of the viral outbreak which has so far infected nearly 1,300 people and killed 41 others. Read Also: China to build 1,000-bed hospital within a weekAFP saw a steady trickle of cars approaching the roadblocks around 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of the city centre on Saturday morning, only for police in fluorescent jackets wearing masks to tell them to turn around. The barricade, at one of the tolls for highways exiting the city, was blocked with red and yellow plastic barriers and cones. ""Nobody can leave,"" a policeman told AFP. A stray dog ran across the empty road in front of the roadblocks, which were shrouded in grey fog and drizzle. AFP journalists only saw two vehicles allowed to pass the roadblock, including a white van which an officer said was ""buying medicines"" and would later return to the city. Authorities extended transport bans to 17 other cities around Wuhan in a gargantuan effort to control the SARS-like virus, restricting travel for around 56 million in Hubei province. While there are restrictions on anyone leaving Wuhan, a few people were allowed to enter the city through the barricade: Desperately needed medical workers whose holidays were cut short to help overwhelmed hospital. An empty bus was allowed to pass the roadblock into Wuhan after showing documentation to the police at the roadblock. Three young nurses who crossed the barrier on foot told AFP they were going to two hospitals. Two of them were waiting for a friend to pick them up. ""We went to our hometowns for holidays before the ban on transportation, but because of the epidemic we have to come back quickly to Wuhan,"" said one. Dragging wheelie cases behind them, they were holding their coat hoods up against the rain. ""They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,"" another medical worker who didn't want to be named told AFP. In the city centre, temples were closed and holiday festivities cancelled, but people gathered instead in pharmacies to buy medical supplies. At one store, customers queued at the cash register while staff in protective gear retrieved what they needed and brought it out to them. Pharmacy staff were in full body suits and gloves, wearing two sets of face masks. People rifled through boxes of face masks, comparing different makes and models. Full body suits had already sold out. Amid fears of rising prices and lack of products, some sales were being restricted and officials were regulating sales. ""My duty is to supervise the price of what pharmacist are selling,"" said Li Xiang, a market supervisor at one pharmacy. ""Goods must be from official channels and prices shall not be hiked."" Li told AFP that the government was making an effort to ""maintain social stability and safeguard people's lives."" A popular traditional Chinese medicine for treating fevers was being restricted to only two boxes per person to manage high demand. A local radio station played in the pharmacy ran an advert reminding people to wear a mask. ""Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,"" said one man in a surgical mask who declined to give his name. ""The government is in control of this. It's not a problem,"" he added. Meanwhile, in a taxi, a rap song playing on the radio echoed the patriotic fervour, telling people not to be afraid of the virus.

" Coronavirus: 10 people who returned from China under watch in hospitals in Kerala, Mumbai and Hyderabad | India News - Times of India","KOCHI/MUMBAI: Ten people — seven in Kerala, two in Mumbai and one in Hyderabad — who were among the hundreds of passengers who returned from China in the recent days are under observation in hospitals to check for possible exposure to the deadly novel coronavirus, central and state officials said on Friday. Officials in Kerala said another 73 people were being kept under medical surveillance at their homes in the state. As over 20,000 passengers returning from mainland China and Hong Kong underwent thermal screenings at the seven international airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi has set up an isolation ward and kept beds ready for providing treatment to any suspected case of the respiratory infection. Coronavirus outbreak: Indian embassy starts hotline in ChinaAccording to Kerala state health ministry officials in Thiruvananthapuram, seven people who had shown mild symptoms of fever, cough and sore throat are under watch in state-run hospitals in different districts in the state. Two of them are in the state capital while one each is in observation in Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode and Pathanamthitta. The state government has advised those under home surveillance to remain at home for 28 days from the date of their departure from China. Indian school teacher becomes first foreigner to contract deadly virus in ChinaThe coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus in China is a novel strain and not seen before. It has killed 26 people so far, and has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). According to a Union health ministry official, two people who returned from China have been kept under observation at a Mumbai hospital while one person has been placed under watch at a hospital in Hyderabad. However, no positive case has been detected in the country so far, he said. The official said a total of 20,844 passengers who travelled in 96 flights from China have been screened at the airports till January 24. Also, on the basis of the details provided by the Indian Embassy in China, around 25 students who have returned to India recently from Wuhan are being closely monitored, the official said. Their details have been shared with district-level officers and they are being monitored closely for any symptoms. Two people who returned to Mumbai from China have been kept in an isolation ward at Kasturba Hospital, and their blood samples collected to check for the new strain of coronavirus, officials said in Mumbai. As many as 1,789 passengers underwent thermal screening at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai for the coronavirus since January 19 and two of them were admitted to civic-run Kasturba Hospital in the city as a precaution, they said. Till now, no cases of coronavirus infection have been detected during screening, a health department official said. ""No passenger with history of visit to Wuhan city of China in the last 14 days was found positive (for the virus) during thermal scanning,"" he said. Coronavirus cases were first reported from Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei province. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has created an isolation ward at the Kasturba hospital. ""The isolation ward has been created for diagnosis and treatment of people suspected to have the virus infection,"" said Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer of the BMC. Keskar said the two people under observation at the hospital have mild cough and exhibited cold-related symptoms. Doctors at the airport have been asked to send travellers returning from China to the isolation ward if they show any symptoms of the novel coronavirus, she said. ""All private doctors in the city have been asked to alert us if they observe symptoms of coronavirus in any person who has returned from China,"" she added. According to Kasturba Hospital sources, they have received detailed instructions from the Maharashtra government about how to deal with a coronavirus infection. Apart from Kasturba Hospital, quarantine facilities have also been provided at Naidu Hospital in Pune, the officials said. During the screening at the Mumbai airport, six passengers — three from Pune and another three from Mumbai — underwent further medical examination, he said. ""Four of them were found to be perfectly alright. As a precaution, two others who were suffering from a minor cold and cough have been admitted to the Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai and kept under monitoring,"" he said. AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said, ""We have an isolation ward and we have beds kept ready for providing care and treatment for suspected coronavirus cases in Delhi or elsewhere in India."" ""All precautionary measures — in terms of personal protection equipment for healthcare workers to prevent the spread of the disease while treating infected patients — are in place.""

Many people have planned travel over the long weekend for the new year. The ministry said there are no student trips planned currently to Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus. None are planned for China in February. It said it would advise educational institutes to postpone trips in March and later, if necessary. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
"Coronavirus in China: SARS-like virus could mutate, 'spread further'; death toll hits 9 - Times of India","BEIJING: China warned on Wednesday that a SARS-like virus could mutate and spread as the death toll rose to nine and the number of cases reached 440 across the country. The coronavirus is transmitted via the respiratory tract and there ""is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease"", National Health Commission vice minister Li Bin said at a news conference. The commission announced measures to contain the disease as hundreds of millions of people travel across the country for this week's Lunar New Year holiday, including disinfection and ventilation at airports, train stations and shopping centres. ""When needed, temperature checks will also be implemented in key areas at crowded places,"" the commission said in a statement. The virus has been detected in some other Asian countries, and the United States confirmed its first case on Tuesday. The epicentre of the outbreak is the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where authorities have stepped up fever checks at the airport, train stations and highways, while a major Lunar New Year event that draws hundreds of thousands of people was cancelled.

North Korea to ban tourists over China virus: Report - Times of India,"SEOUL: North Korea will ban foreign tourists to protect itself against a new SARS-like virus that has claimed at least nine lives in China and sickened hundreds, a major tour operator said. Several nations including the US have stepped up checks on airport passengers to detect the coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, but a ban on tourists would be a first. The virus has caused alarm in China and abroad because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. The vast majority of foreign tourists to North Korea are Chinese, and their numbers have swelled significantly in the last year as relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have warmed, generating vital foreign currency for the isolated country. But as of Wednesday, North Korea will ""temporarily close its borders to all foreign tourists as a precaution to the coronavirus"", Chinese-based specialist operator Young Pioneer Tours said in a statement. Exact details had yet to be confirmed, it added. Koryo Tours, the market leader for Western visitors, said it had been ""informed that action was being considered"" and was expecting more information Wednesday. Pyongyang has taken similar action in the past -- it closed its borders to foreign tourists for more than four months from October 2014 in a bid to keep out the Ebola virus, even though no cases had been reported in Asia. It enforced a 21-day quarantine period on anyone entering the country, including foreign diplomats and businesspeople. Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper did not mention any North Korean action over the virus Wednesday but reported on the outbreak in China, saying it had ""spread rapidly"" and that authorities in its giant neighbour were taking ""corresponding measures"". The North has poor medical infrastructure and a chronic shortage of medicines. When South Korea suffered from the world's largest outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, in summer 2015, the North reportedly prohibited its diplomats and workers overseas from returning to their homeland for months to prevent the spread of the virus. Pyongyang also suspended foreign tours for three months due to fears over SARS in 2003. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
New china virus:  China coronavirus claims 4th victim as more screenings added - Times of India,"BEIJING: A fourth person has died in an outbreak of a new coronavirus in China, authorities said Tuesday, as more places stepped up medical screening of travelers from the country as it enters its busiest travel period. The increased control measures followed a sharp rise in the number of infections to more than 200 people since last month, with epidemiologists still uncertain of its nature and mode of transmission. Chinese health authorities confirmed late Monday that some cases had been transmitted person-to-person, a development that means the illness could spread faster and more widely, particularly at the start of the Lunar New Year travel rush. Concerned about a global outbreak similar to SARS, which spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-2003, numerous nations have adopted screening measures for travelers arriving from China, especially those from the central city of Wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated and which has accounted for the vast majority of the cases. Australia's chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said his country will be increasing airport screening. Australia receives a significant number of travelers from China, including three direct flights a week from Wuhan into Sydney, and these flights will be met by border security and biosecurity staff for assessments, Murphy told reporters. Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and other countries and regions with extensive travel links to China are also enacting stricter screening measures. At least three US airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. Chinese authorities have confirmed cases in Wuhan, Beijing and Guangdong, with suspected cases in Shanghai and other parts of the country. Additionally, Thailand detected two cases among Chinese travelers and South Korean and Japan have reported one each. The outbreak is believed to have started late last month among people connected to a seafood market in Wuhan, which had a total of 198 cases as of Monday. All four fatalities have been in Wuhan, although it wasn't clear if the latest death was a new case or one already diagnosed. The head of the China's expert team on the illness, respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the virus from family members, state media said. Some medical workers have also tested positive for the virus, the English-language China Daily newspaper reported. Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed government departments Monday to promptly release information on the virus and deepen international cooperation. China has notified and maintained close communication with the World Health Organization and other relevant countries and regions, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing. Wuhan has also adopted measures to control the flow of people leaving the city, Geng said. Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath, and some developed pneumonia. On the Weibo social media platform, which is widely used in China, people posted prevention advice such as wearing masks and washing hands. Some people said they had canceled their travel plans and were staying home for Lunar New Year. Everyone entering Beijing United Family Hospital on Tuesday was required to have their temperature checked as soon as they entered the door. The hospital provided surgical masks to all patients, who were told they had to wear them. All nurses, doctors and cleaning staff were also wearing masks. The initial cases were connected to a seafood market in Wuhan, which has been closed for an investigation. The family of coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800. The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of the SARS epidemic, but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.

"Kolkata airport on toes over mystery China virus, flyers being screened | Kolkata News - Times of India","KOLKATA: The mystery virus that has affected scores in China and resulted in three deaths may be a threat to Kolkata, which serves as a gateway to the southeastern part of the country, experts have warned. Checking the spread of the coronavirus — which has triggered pneumonia-like symptoms — can be difficult if the bug is carried to the city by an infected individual, virologists have said. Reports of the spread of the virus in China and Japan and Thailand have prompted a travel advisory from the Union health ministry and resulted in screenings for passengers and crew of flights from China. “We have introduced screening at the airport and travellers with symptoms of the viral attack will be quarantined immediately to prevent an outbreak,” airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee said on Monday. All passengers flying to the city from China are being subjected to a “thermal screening” at the airport since last Friday. Four airlines fly to three destinations in China directly from Kolkata. IndiGo and China Eastern Airlines run daily direct flights from Guanzhou and Kunming, respectively; Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon operate flights from Hong Kong. “We have set up health counters at the pre-immigration area for inbound passengers from China. Passengers and crew are being asked to undergo thermal scanning to detect body temperature. In case they have fever, they will be isolated and sent to the Beleghata Infectious Diseases Hospital. However, so far, no one arriving here has tested positive,” Bhattacharjee said. Virus can spread via cough, sneezeCoronaviruses, being “droplet infections”, are highly contagious and can affect thousands in a matter of days. “Coronaviruses spread through cough and sneeze and can be easily transmitted in a closed environment. Even a single infected individual travelling on an aircraft can spread the virus to several,” internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain said. “And, once the infected individual reaches an airport or a station, many more may be infected even before s/he is identified and quarantined. So we need to be very careful and start screening travellers from China immediately,” he added. “Droplets released through cough or sneeze can travel six feet, which puts everyone around an infected person at risk,” RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) consultant Arindam Biswas said. “Coronaviruses affect the lungs causing severe cough, cold and respiratory distress in extreme cases. The infection, unless checked in time, can turn into pneumonia that can be fatal. It seems from reports from China that this virus is akin to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that has claimed many lives in multiple outbreaks in recent years,” said Biswas. The virus started spreading from Wuhan in south-east China but has now reached Beijing. Similar cases have been detected in Thailand and Japan as well, which might indicate that the virus has already started spreading across the region. The virus strain is yet to be identified but it is suspected to have spread from a seafood market in Wuhan that was shut down on January 1. But the infection had spread far by then. A coronavirus outbreak could be difficult to manage in a city like Kolkata, with a big elderly population having immunity-affecting diseases like diabetes, kidney ailments and cardiac ailments. The viral attack itself may not be fatal but could trigger a secondary infection that may turn out to be deadly, Jain said. “Those with low immunity will be more vulnerable. Coronavirus leads to a reduced immunity in the elderly, because it invades the lungs, and they may then turn susceptible to bacterial infections that may lead to death,” he added. Coronaviruses, despite their symptoms being similar to those of the common flu, can trigger a severe inflammatory response from the body. “The immune system reacts more strongly because of the severity of the virus and it ends up affecting vital organs like lungs and kidneys. Younger people are more likely to suffer because of a strong immune response that proves counter-productive; the elderly are likely to be left defenceless because of their low immunity,” explained Biswas.

 Indian school teacher becomes first foreigner to contract deadly virus in China | India News - Times of India,"BEIJING: A 45-year-old Indian school teacher is undergoing treatment for a new strain of pneumonia outbreak spreading in the Chinese cities of Wuhan and Shenzhen, becoming the first foreigner to have contracted the mysterious SARS-like coronavirus. Preeti Maheshwari, a teacher at an international school in Shenzhen, has been admitted to a local hospital after she fell seriously ill last Friday. Doctors on Monday confirmed that she was suffering from the virus and is being treated for it, her husband Ashuman Khowal told PTI from Shenzhen. The virus has caused alarm because of its connection to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) which killed nearly 650 people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Khowal, a businessman from Delhi, said Maheswari was being treated in the intensive care unit and is currently on a ventilator and other supporting systems. Khowal, who is allowed to visit the patient for a few hours every day, said she was unconscious and doctors have said she could take a long time to recover. According to the reports from Wuhan, where the virus started surfacing few weeks ago, 17 new cases have been reported, taking the total number of cases to 62. A total of 19 have been cured and discharged from the hospital, and the rest remain in isolation and are receiving treatment, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday. Two people in Shenzhen are currently in quarantine at the Third People's Hospital, which specialises in the treatment of infectious diseases, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported. India on Friday issued an advisory to its nationals visiting China following a second death due to the outbreak of the new strain of pneumonia in the Chinese city of Wuhan where over 500 Indian medical students are studying. ""An infection with a novel coronavirus has been reported from China. As on 11th January, 2020, 41 confirmed cases have been reported so far,"" said the travel warning issued by India. Travel-related cases have been reported one each in Thailand and Japan. Over 500 Indian students study in the Wuhan city's medical colleges in universities. But most of them appear to have left for home for the Chinese New Year holidays. The clinical signs and symptoms are mainly fever with a few patients having difficulty in breathing, the Indian travel warning said. Mode of transmission is unclear as of now. However, so far there is little evidence of significant human- to-human transmission, it said. The patients showed symptoms such as fever or cough, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. Epidemiological investigations into the 17 new cases are underway and close contacts are being traced, the authority said, adding that Wuhan will continue to expand the search area, identify suspected cases and conduct sampling tests. Epidemiological analysis of previously published cases found that some cases had no exposure to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is believed to be related to most of the infected cases. It has been temporarily closed while disinfection is carried out, the Xinhua report said. A total of 681 among 763 close contacts who were placed under medical observation have been released. No cases were found among the close contacts. Read this story in BengaliDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
US to screen passengers for new China coronavirus at 3 airports - Times of India,"The United States will begin screening efforts at three US airports to detect travelers from the central Chinese city of Wuhan who may have symptoms of a new respiratory virus that so far has killed two people and infected 45 more, public health officials said on Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening at the San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports would begin on Friday and focus on travelers to the United States via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan. So far, the new virus has spread outside of China to Japan and Thailand, and CDC officials said in a conference call with reporters that they expect more cases will be reported outside of China. The risk to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said. Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said the CDC will be sending about 100 additional staff to the three airports- Los Angeles International, San Francisco International and New York's John F Kennedy International- to supplement existing staff at quarantine stations located at those airports. Under the screening procedures, travelers from Wuhan will be taken to a separate area in the airport, where they will complete a questionnaire and be checked for fever. Those with symptoms will be asked additional health- and exposure-related questions, and those needing more follow-up will be referred to a designated healthcare facility for more testing. The CDC said it may adjust screening procedures as the outbreak investigation continues. The Chinese virus is a coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a highly infectious virus that originated in China in 2002 and eventually traveled to 37 countries, killing 774 people. So far, health officials do not consider the new virus from China to be as lethal as SARS, but the investigation is evolving and much is still not known about whether the virus can spread easily from person to person. ""This is the stage of the investigation where we need to proceed cautiously and be prepared for any eventuality,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a CDC expert in respiratory diseases, said on the conference call. ""It's highly plausible"" that there will be a case in the United States, Messonnier said. ""That is why we are moving forward with this screening."" China health officials report that most of the patients infected with the virus have had exposure to a large market where live animals were present, suggesting the virus is new and has jumped from animals to humans. It is still not clear how well the virus can be transmitted, but there are indications of some limited spread from person-to-person, CDC officials said. The World Health Organization this week provided guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but antivirals are being considered. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."

Bengaluru reports more herpes cases in winter too | Bengaluru News - Times of India,"BENGALURU: Cases of herpes zoster are on rise in the city. The skin-related infection, caused by Varicella Zoster virus, usually occurs in summer when the temperature rises, but it is now being reported in winter too. ""It's challenging to diagnose herpes infection in the first 4-5 days. The patient complains of constant pain everywhere. Once the skin lesions appear, it becomes apparent. But when the symptoms are full blown, it can lead to shooting pain and further complications. It also takes more time for recovery,"" says Dr Ambanna Gowda, consultant internal medicine specialist, Fortis Hospital, who attended to 2-3 cases of herpes every week in December. "" Those with low immunity levels are vulnerable; it's also seen among the geriatric population and diabetic patients,"" Dr Gowda added. ""Herpes is caused by the reactivation of the same virus that causes chickenpox. Though children are vaccinated against chickenpox, no vaccine is 100% effective. When immunity decreases, the infection spreads,"" said Dr Ravikeerthi M, senior consultant physician, BR Life SSNMC hospital. While most herpes cases are treated by physicians, some complicated ones land up with dermatologists. ""Those who didn't get chickenpox during childhood are vulnerable to herpes when they become adults, especially if there is lack of immunity. The virus is dormant in the body, resting on the spinal cord. It gets reactivated when there is low immunity. Recurrence is rare, but can happen if immunity goes down further,"" says Dr Umashankar Nagaraju, a dermatologist. According to Dr BV Ramesh Babu, dermatologist, Citizen's Skin Clinic, Malleswaram, once a nerve segment gets affected by herpes, leading to inflammation and excruciating pain, it takes 11-18 days for complete recovery. ""Lesions appear seven days after a person contracts the infection. During this time, there may not be major symptoms but the affected person couldspread the infection further,"" said Dr Babu, who gets around six cases every month. While physicians and dermatologists have their hands full, Dr Zankhana Buch, medical superintendent, AyurVaid Hospitals, who treated two cases of herpes in December, said ayurveda too has effective treatment for the infection.

Virus in air sends kids to ICUs with respiratory infections | Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: The nip in the air and the holiday season is making it the best playtime for children, but it is also landing many children in bed for respiratory and viral infections. Many adults, too, are opting to work from home with hot soups, rasam and power naps as viruses spread in winter. Doctors see long queues outside their clinics and high occupancy of beds in their children’s wards. The chill in December months harbours viruses, unlike the warmth during the rest of the year. “Almost every patient walking into the hospital complains of cough, cold, or wheezing triggered by viruses,” said paediatrician Dr S Balasubramanian, medical director, Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust Hospital. “It not only lasts long, but also sends some children to ICUs following complications of pneumonia,” he said. Doctor don’t often verify the strain unless patients develop complications. Many children moved into ICUs tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes infections of the lungs and the respiratory tract. “It is more common in children, particularly premature babies, infants and those with a weak immune system,” he said. While most of the children recover in a few days with medication, a few need ventilator support. Signs and symptoms of RSV appear about four to six days after exposure to the virus. In adults and older children, the symptoms mimic common cold — congested or runny nose, dry cough, low-grade fever, sore throat and mild headache. “I was feeling tired and just wanted to stay in bed,” said S Kavya, a law student, infected by the virus. Kavya was lucky. In some people, the infection spreads to lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia or bronchiolitis — inflammation of the small airway passages entering the lungs. “It leaves them with fever, severe cough, wheezing with other secondary infections that may require antibiotics,” said Dr P Kuganandam of SIMS Hospital. While there are no vaccines in the market against most viruses, public health experts say washing hands frequently, limiting contact with people who have fevers or cold and properly discarding used tissues can help prevent spread of infections. Smoking can aggravate symptoms. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Coronavirus: WHO says China virus now global emergency | World News - Times of India,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING: The US drew China’s ire with a travel warning on Friday while businesses struggled with supply problems from the coronavirus epidemic that has killed 213 people and been declared a global emergency. Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reported their first cases, Rome declaring its own national emergency as it sought to reconstruct the itinerary of two infected Chinese tourists. “Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan,” the US state department said, raising the warning for China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq. On Friday, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines said they are suspending all service to mainland China. Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with the US, called that move “truly mean” given the World Health Organisationhad commended its containment efforts and not recommended travel or trade curbs. “The WHO urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the US did the opposite,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. “It’s truly mean.” Japan also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China, while Bahrain recommended no travel to any country hit by the virus, and Iran urged a ban on all travellers from China. With fallout inevitable for the world’s No. 2 economy, global shares were heading for their biggest weekly losses since August on Friday, and oil and metals markets were showing even more brutal damage. The outbreak could “reverberate globally”, Moody’s said. In the latest impact to big name corporations, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend to cope with a supply disruption caused by the outbreak. Appliance maker Electrolux issued a similar warning. And French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid-February. After holding off as the crisis grew, the WHO said on Thursday the epidemic in China — which originated from animals in Wuhan city — did constitute a health emergency of international concern. Wuhan’s Communist Party chief said the city should have acted earlier to contain the virus. The number of confirmed cases has risen beyond 9,800. More than 130 cases have been reported in at least 25 other countries and regions. The WHO has reported at least eight cases of human-tohuman transmission in four countries: the US, Germany, Japan and Vietnam. Thailand said it too had such a case. China’s statistics show just over 2% of infected people have died, suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS. But economists fear its impact could be bigger than SARS, which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of $33 billion to the global economy, since China’s share of the world economy is now far greater.

Coronavirus China: China's isolation grows as virus toll reaches 259 | World News - Times of India,"BEIJING: China faced deepening isolation over its coronavirus epidemic on Saturday as the death toll soared to 259, with the United States leading a growing list of nations to impose extraordinary Chinese travel bans. With Britain, Russia and Sweden among the countries confirming their first infections, the virus has now spread to more than two dozen nations, sending governments scurrying to limit their exposure. The United States toughened its stance Friday by declaring a national emergency, temporarily barring entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks. ""Foreign nationals, other than immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents, who have travelled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time,"" Health Secretary Alex Azar said. That follows similar steps by countries including Italy, Singapore, and China's northern neighbour Mongolia. The United States, Japan, Britain, Germany and other nations already had advised their citizens not to travel to China. Beijing, which insists it can contain the virus, began to show impatience over the growing ostracism, with the foreign ministry calling Washington's earlier advice against travel to China ""unkind"". ""Certainly it is not a gesture of goodwill,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. The US emergency declaration also requires Americans returning from the ground zero Chinese province of Hubei to be placed in mandatory 14-day quarantine, and health screening for US citizens coming from other parts of China. The virus emerged in early December and has been traced to a market in Hubei's capital Wuhan that sold wild animals. It then jumped to humans and spread globally on the wings of a Lunar New Year holiday rush that sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel domestically and overseas. With public anger mounting in China, Wuhan's top official admitted late Friday that authorities there had acted too slowly. ""If strict control measures had been taken earlier the result would have been better than now,"" Ma Guoqiang, the Communist Party chief for Wuhan, told state media. Ma said he was ""in a state of guilt, remorse and self-reproach."" Wuhan officials have been criticised online for withholding information about the outbreak until late December despite knowing of it weeks earlier. China finally lurched into action more than a week ago, effectively quarantining whole cities in Hubei and tens of millions of people. The rest of the country has been essentially put on a war footing. The unprecedented safeguards imposed nationwide include extending the holiday, postponing school restarts and tight health screening on travellers nationwide. But the toll keeps mounting at an ever-increasing pace, with health authorities on Saturday saying 46 more people had died in the preceding 24 hours, all but one in Hubei. Another 2,102 new infections also were confirmed, bringing the total to nearly 12,000 -- far higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of 2002-03. SARS, which is similar to the new coronavirus and also originated in China, killed 774 people worldwide, most in China or Hong Kong. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global emergency on Thursday but did not advise international trade or travel restrictions. It warned Friday that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmission and could accelerate the virus's spread. But authorities around the world pressed ahead with preventive measures. Citing a likely ""sharper rise"" in infections, Singapore on Friday barred arrivals and transit passengers from mainland China. Mongolia on Saturday toughened earlier restrictions by implementing a ban on any arrivals from its huge southern neighbour until March 2. Impoverished Papua New Guinea went so far as to bar all visitors from ""Asian ports"" last week. Adding to concerns over combatting the contagion, Thai health officials on Friday said a taxi driver became the kingdom's first case of human-to-human transmission. Thailand joins China, Germany, Japan, France and the United States with confirmed domestic infections. The health crisis has dented China's international image, putting Chinese nationals in difficult positions abroad, amid complaints of racism. In one striking example, more than 40,000 workers at a vast Chinese-controlled industrial park in Indonesia -- which also employs 5,000 staff from China -- were put under quarantine, the facility said on Friday. No one can enter or leave with out permission, said Pt Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park on Sulawesi island. World markets tumbled again on Friday due to the uncertainty hovering over the world's second-largest economy, a key driver of global growth. Growing numbers of major airlines have suspended or reduced China flights, while corporate names ranging from Toyota to McDonald's and Starbucks have shut down Chinese stores or production lines. Countries have scrambled to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with hundreds of US, Japanese, British, French, South Korean, and Indian citizens evacuated so far, and more countries planning airlifts. Russia said it would evacuate more than 2,500 of its citizens holidaying on China's Hainan island, far from the epicentre. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
China flying home residents of virus-afflicted region - Times of India,"BEIJING: China's foreign ministry said Friday it will send charter flights to bring home residents of virus-afflicted region from overseas. The one-sentence statement gave few details, but said those from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan would be sent directly back to Wuhan in light of the 'practical difficulties' they were encountering. The new type of virus originated in Wuhan and has since spread to more than a dozen nations and regions overseas. Most of the overseas cases were found among people who had traveled from Wuhan, although physicians are concerned about person-to-person transmission affecting people who had not been in the major industrial center of 11 million people in central China. Chna has placed more than 50 million people in the region under virtual quarantine, while foreign countries have cut back severely on travel to the country and isolated those who recently passed through Wuhan. The virus is believed to have a two-week incubation period, during which those infected can pass on the illness even if they show no symptoms such as fever and cough.

Gurugram: This potholed sector road kicks up a cloud of dust and woes | Gurgaon News - Times of India,"GURUGRAM: It’s no wonder that the many living in sectors 37C and 37D launched a ‘No road, no vote’ campaign during the recent assembly elections. They might all have a place to call home but connectivity is debatable, and convenience of life a chimera. The sector road — or what little of it has been built, by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) —is full of craters, and because it is half constructed, passing vehicles raise plenty of dust and add to the pollution. One side lies under water whenever it rains. Besides, the streetlights don’t work. “Throughout the day, driving is a real challenge. In fact, we can only use one lane because the other lane has been damaged by waterlogging,” says Sumana Bhattacharya, who stays in Taksila Heights, Sector 37C. “Once, my car tyre got punctured due to a pothole. The road is broken down and it continues to break up, because it hasn’t been fixed for almost a year —it’s all a complete mess.” As per the approved plan, a 60m wide approach or service road was supposed to have been constructed.  “We have paid a lot of money to live here but there has been no development,” shared a resident of Taksila Heights. “The government is aware of the issues but is not bothered about taking any action.” Incidentally, Corona Optus, BPTP Park Serene, ILD Greens and Imperia Esfera are among the other societies in the vicinity, residents of which depend on the road for connectivity. A complaint regarding the unfinished road was registered in the CM grievance redressal system on April 5 this year, but more than seven months on, no action taken report has been submitted, despite frequent reminders by the land acquisition officer, Gurugram.  “The complaint was filed through the CM’s Window. Initially, it was forwarded to the HSVP executive engineer, Sector 9, but was again returned to the CM’s office,” explained Yadvendra Yadav, a resident of NBCC Green View. “It seems that even the government does not know whom to assign.” On October 31, Yadav wrote to the chief minister, requesting that the road be swept; cleaning, he pointed out, had not been done for four years. Not surprisingly, safety is a serious issue. Bhattacharya often gets late returning home from work, and the ride back, negotiating a road that’s potholed and poorly lit, is not something she looks forward to. “A proper, lit-up road is a basic right,” she insists. “But this road is mostly very dark, and it’s kind of scary when I’m coming back.” A liquor shop, across from a school, is another security headache locals have to deal with. Cops, meanwhile, look the other way. “We have complained to everyone, from the chief minister to the new MLA, but noone responds to our tweets,” Bhattacharya mentioned. Speaking to TOI, a GMDA engineer informed that due to litigation, land could not be acquired to complete construction of the road. He also brushed off concerns over the condition of the road, defending the standard of work carried out by the authority. The hassled residents would beg to disagree. For all that, they would be hoping for a better quality of life than the one they’ve become accustomed to in the last five years. It’s not too much to expect, is it?

 Coronavirus outbreak: How China virus is affecting the world | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The death toll in China due to novel coronavirus epidemic has jumped to 170 with 38 more fatalities reported mainly from the worst-affected central Hubei province, China's government said on Thursday. The government further confirmed that more than 1,700 new infections have been reported. While the Asian giant reels to contain the virus, here are the latest updates on the epidemic:  How is Coronavirus affecting the world 1 India reports first case of Coronavirus  Health ministry confirmed that a student of Wuhan University, China, who travelled to Kerala, India, has tested positive for Coronavirus (nCoV). The patient, who is in isolation at the hospital, is stable and is being closely monitored. Health officials said that the case from Kerala was informed by NIV Pune and that they will set in place a Nipah like protocol.  At present, 10 people are in isolation ward at different hospitals and the health department had sent 18 samples for testing to NIV, Pune. 2 Spread of China's novel Coronavirus  China's National Health Commission said on Thursday that 1,370 patients remained in critical conditions, and 12,167 people were suspected of being infected with the virus by the end of Wednesday. A total of 124 people have been discharged from hospital after recovery.  A total of 1,737 new confirmed cases, including the first in Tibet, and 4,148 new suspected cases, and 38 deaths - 37 in Hubei Province and one in Sichuan Province - were reported by Wednesday.  A total of 88,693 close contacts had been traced, the commission said, adding that among them, 2,364 were discharged from medical observation on Wednesday, with 81,947 others still under medical observation, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.  In Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 10 confirmed cases were reported by Wednesday.  So far, five cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in the United States, none of them fatal.  A family of four Chinese tourists in the United Arab Emirates became the Mideast's first cases of the virus. 3 Coronavirus cases in China surpasses SARS cases  Mainland China now has more cases of coronavirus than it had of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a respiratory infection that spread across China in 2002 and 2003 and killed 774 people in 17 countries.  During the SARS outbreak, China had 5,327 cases and 349 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.  In comparison to the new virus, the SARS virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS. 4 WHO to decide if Wuhan Coronavirus is a global emergency  The World Health Organization emergencies chief said the few cases of human-to-human spread of the virus outside China -in Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam-were of ``great concern'' and were part of the reason the U.N. health agency's director-general was reconvening a committee of experts on Thursday to assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency.  The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.  Dr. Michael Ryan spoke at a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday after returning from a trip to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government leaders. He said China was taking ``extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge`` posed by the outbreak.  To date, about 99% of the cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it's likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed.  The World Health Organisation's global risk assessment for 2019-nCoV is ""high"". It is ""very high"" for China, the source of the outbreak. But the UN body hasn't declared a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" -- or PHEIC -- like the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year. 5 Airlines suspend flights to Chinese cities  A number of global airlines, including Air India, British Airways, Lion Air and Indigo airlines on Wednesday suspended their flights to Chinese cities.  British Airways halted all flights to China and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai.  Air India and South Korean budget carrier Seoul Air are also halting all flights to the country, and Indonesia's Lion Air plans to do the same. Other carriers including Finnair, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, and Singapore-based Jetstar Asia are slashing service.  Air India suspended its flights on Delhi-Shanghai route from January 31 to February 14. IndiGo airlines also suspended its flights on the Bengaluru-Hong Kong route from February 1 and on the Delhi-Chengdu route from February 1 to 20.  Beijing too has been asking Chinese not to travel at home and abroad in view of the virus. 6 US companies in China struggle to re-open  In a conference call Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 10.  Isaac Larian, CEO of MGA Entertainment, the maker of the popular LOL dolls, said he's nervous that many workers won't come back to factories and they may close.  Starbucks' shares tumbled 2.5% Wednesday after the company said it will take a financial hit from store closures in China. The Seattle-based coffee giant said more than half of its 4,292 stores in China are now closed. China represented 10% of Starbucks' revenue during its most recent quarter.  By contrast, McDonald's shares were up 2% Wednesday after the company said the financial impact so far has been minimal. McDonald closed several hundred restaurants, including all of its properties in Hubei province. But 3,000 remain open elsewhere in the country. China accounts for 4-5% of McDonalds' revenue. 7 Virus anxiety hits global markets  Asian stocks slipped while gold and bonds were in demand on Thursday as worries about the spread of a new virus from China sent investors heading for safety.  The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as expected, although bank Chairman Jerome Powell's comments about a low inflation outlook added to U.S. government bonds' appeal.  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8% to an almost seven-week low. Japan's Nikkei fell 1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng extended Wednesday's drop and Taiwan's benchmark index opened 1.5% lower in its first session since the Lunar New Year break.  Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which fall when prices rise, tumbled nearly 9 basis points overnight to 1.5790%, and drifted lower to 1.5750% in Asian trade, not far above a three-month low of 1.5700% hit on Tuesday. 8 How is China trying to contain the virus  China has cut off access to the central city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, and 16 other cities to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. That has trapped more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. The outbreak has infected more than 6,000 on the mainland and abroad.  Villages on the outskirts of Beijing closed themselves off to outsiders, with residents blocking roads with piles of earth and standing guard to prevent outsiders and their vehicles from entering.  In 48 hours, over 500 construction workers converted an empty building into a 1,000-bed hospital in the Huangzhou district. Originally, the hospital was to open in May. In addtition, four pre-fabricated buildings are being moddeled to be used as medical health centres. China's government is also constructing a brand new hospital in Wuhan where currently hundereds of construction workers are working round the clock. 9 Foreign nationals evacuate China  Nearly 200 Americans airlifted from China in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak arrived on Wednesday at a U.S. military base in California, where they will remain isolated for at least 72 hours. In Tokyo, the second group of Japanese evacuees arrived aboard a government-chartered flight. The European Union was working to bring back 600 citizens from 14 countries.  Sporting events in China were also postponed and Olympic qualifying tournaments were moved elsewhere. China's women's soccer team was quarantined in Australia ahead of an Olympic qualifying tournament. None of the players has shown symptoms.  More than a dozen nations with a handful of cases — including the United States — are isolating patients and monitoring their contacts, as well as screening travelers from China and urging people to postpone trips there. 10 What is new in the China virus outbreak  Scientists have identified the illness as a new kind of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS, although so far the new virus does not appear to be as deadly or contagious.  Symptoms of the new virus include fever, cough and shortness of breath. But whether this virus can be contained depends on factors still unknown, like just how contagious it is and when in the course of the infection the virus starts to spread.  Among patients with the Wuhan coronavirus, about 20% have become seriously ill, and the rest have a mild illness, the WHO said at a news briefing on Wednesday. So far, the death rate appears to be about 2%, but that is not certain yet. Those who die tend to be older people with underlying ailments. The median age of the first 425 patients in China was 59, and a little more than half were male, according to a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.  Diseases caused by related coronaviruses are deadlier: SARS killed 10%, and MERS about 35%.  But if the new virus were to spread even more widely and a 2% mortality rate continued, the death toll could be considerable. Seasonal flu, with a much lower overall death rate of 0.1%, kills more than half a million people worldwide every year. 11 What is a virus?  Viruses are smaller than bacteria. Scientists can't agree if they are living or not. Viruses cannot reproduce independently of a host. They can parasite all life forms such as animal, plant, fungus and bacteria. Specific viruses depend on specific hosts. They hijack cells to use the host's cellular machinery for reproduction. They exit everywhere on the planet. In the past five years the number of species identified have increased by 20 times.  The Wuhan coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, is part of a family of viruses named for the effect created by spike proteins on their shells, or capsids.  Seven kinds of coronavirus can infect people which includes 2019-nCoV, SARS and MERS.  Coronaviruses are initially transmitted from animals to humans. China says 2019-nCoV can be transmitted between people. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"Along with virus, anti-China feeling spreads abroad - Times of India","JAKARTA/HANOI: The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, from shops barring entry to Chinese tourists, online vitriol mocking the country’s exotic meat trade and surprise health checks on foreign workers. The virus, which originated in China, has spread to more than a dozen countries, many of them in Southeast Asia which has sensitive relations with China amid concerns about Beijing’s vast infrastructure spending and political clout in the region and sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. But as far away as France, a newspaper has come under fire for its “Yellow Alert” headline, echoing a historic Western racist term “Yellow Peril” used to sow fear of Asian influence, while authorities and schools in Toronto, Canada, have warned against discrimination against Chinese Canadians. Chinese authorities have said the virus emerged from a market selling illegally traded wildlife, giving rise to widespread social media mocking of China’s demand for exotic delicacies and ingredients for traditional medicine. “Stop eating bats,” said one Twitter user in Thailand. “Because your country is beginning (to) spread disease-...we do not accept to serve the guest from China,” read a sign outside a hotel in Vietnam. Authorities later told the hotel to remove the sign. In Myanmar, officials launched surprise health checks on Chinese workers.

"Australia recreates virus, may help make vaccine - Times of India","MELBOURNE: A team of scientists in Australia said on Wednesday they have successfully developed a lab-grown version of the new coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside of China, in a breakthrough that could help quicken the creation of a vaccine. Researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity said they would share the sample. Raina MacIntyre, who runs the Kirby Institute’s biosecurity research programme, said the creation of the virus sample would hasten the development of potential vaccines, as drugs could be tested on animals injected with the disease. The sample could also be used to generate an antibody test, which would allow detection of the virus in patients who had not shown symptoms, the Doherty Instite said.

Chinese villages shun outsiders as virus spreads - Times of India,"BEIJING: In a village in Beijing’s far northeastern Shunyi district, residents have set an informal rule: “If you’re here, don’t leave. If they’ve left, don’t let them come back.” Red tape was tied across the road at the entrance to the small community on Monday. Village committee members wearing face masks and high-visibility vests manned the blockade. Since last week, a public address system had been broadcasting messages, residents said, warning people against inviting guests and urging anyone who has been to Wuhan to register with authorities. “We grow our own leeks... we have a lot of frozen pork, rice and oil. There’s no need for us to go outside,” villager Lu Weian said. “Every house is its own quarantine zone.” The village, hundreds of miles from Wuhan, is one of many across China shunning outsiders amid rising panic over the virus. A decision by authorities to lock down travel in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, has spurred a counter-movement of communities closing their gates to outsiders. Social media showed dozens of images and videos from across China of similar vigilante efforts. Some showed villages blocking roads with vehicles, others constructing make-shift barriers out of tape and cinder-blocks. Zhengding county in Hebei province, outside Beijing, on Monday began offering 1,000 yuan ($145) to tipsters for credible information about unregistered people who may have links to Wuhan. In Beijing, some residents and authorities are tracking and registering people who have been to Wuhan. Chen Gang, a retired local in Dongcheng district, went door-to-door helping officials check whether people had recently visited Wuhan or had guests from Hubei. He said many people with Wuhan links were told to stay at home for a quarantine period. For people from Wuhan, the stigma is causing emotional strain. “I think I’m the loneliest person in the world right now,” said Peking University student Carmen Wang (23), a Wuhan native who had to cancel plans to return home from Beijing. She said she has been shunned by classmates, who sent messages in a class group chat warning others not to visit her. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
Xi Jinping Vows To Beat ‘Demon’ Virus - Times of India,"BEIJING: The death toll in the coronavirus outbreak in China rose nearly 30% in one day, taking the toll to 106. The number of infections jumped 80% in one day to reach 4,600. Infections will be tracked at a more rapid pace both because the mechanism for identifying the infected has now been established and millions of Chinese are returning home from travels related to the Spring festival holidays. Calling the coronavirus a demon, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a war to get rid of the challenge. “The epidemic is a demon and we cannot let this demon hide,” he said. State media quoted visiting WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as saying that China has taken all the necessary measures to fight the crisis and its performance is an example for other countries. The autonomous city of Hong Kong announced measures to check the flow of people from mainland China while several countries cancelled flights connecting the region around Hubei, the most affected province in central China. Wearing a protective mask, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced that high-speed trains and ferries that cross the border will be suspended from Thursday. Several countries, including India, were making arrangements to evacuate their citizens stuck in Hubei province. China has suspended nearly 2,000 long-distance trains and suspended long-distance bus services. There is as yet no sign of evacuation although the state media reported earlier that US citizens have been allowed to leave the locked down city and return home. Chinese authorities are evaluating the medical risks connected with allowing people to leave the isolated city. There are also concerns that local people might react adversely if foreigners are allowed to go. Many international companies, including Facebook, restricted or banned travel to China by their employees. Chinese companies sent out messages to their staff to stay at home on paid leave till mid-February to avoid transmission of the disease. Meanwhile, scientists at the University of Hong Kong announced they have succeeded in separating the virus from an imported case of the infection and have developed a vaccine. But it will take them a long time to test it on animals. Scientists from mainland China and the US are also working on several projects to isolate and identify the virus before producing the right vaccine. The WHO has said that one of the 45 confirmed cases of infection outside China (in Vietnam) has shown signs of human-to-human transmission. Japanese scientists have also claimed they found a similar case of human-to-human transmission, far more dangerous than animal-to-human transmission.

California confirms third case of China virus in US - Times of India,"LOS ANGELES: A patient in California's Orange County was Saturday confirmed as the third person on US soil infected with the new deadly virus that originated in China, health officials said. The infected person was a traveler from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak, the Orange County Health Care Agency said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the patient had tested positive for the Novel Coronavirus, it said. The individual was in isolation in a local hospital and was in good condition. ""There is no evidence that person-to-person transmission has occurred in Orange County. The current risk of local transmission remains low,"" the health care agency said. There were no details given on how the person arrived in the United States or their identity. The two other US cases involve a woman in Chicago who had traveled to Wuhan in late December before returning to the US on January 13, and a man in his thirties from Washington state who had also traveled to the Chinese city recently, the CDC said. The previously unknown virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

Anxious foreigners await rescue from virus epicentre - Times of India,"WUHAN: Anxious foreigners in the locked-down city that spawned China's deadly viral epidemic say they are stranded at home, running out of food and desperate to leave, as governments scrambled to draw up evacuation plans. ""In the past week we've not been able to go out and buy anything to eat,"" said Mashal Jamalzai, a political science student from Afghanistan at Central China Normal University. He said that he and his classmates had been living on biscuits, and his embassy had not responded to requests for help. ""We want to be evacuated as soon as possible, because either the virus, the hunger or the fear will kill us,"" he said. Thousands of foreign students and other international residents live in Wuhan, a normally bustling transport hub in central China home to a huge steel and auto industry. But with schools, hospitals and public offices shut and no transport to and from the city, Hubei University student Siti Mawaddah says the city now ""looks like a ghost town"". ""The situation in Wuhan right now is very intense and worrying,"" the 25-year-old Indonesian said. ""If we stay in Wuhan, it's as if we're just waiting for our turn to get infected,"" she said. Mawaddah said she had heard the US plans to evacuate Americans living in the city, and hoped her own government could do the same. The US state department is sending a flight to collect its consular staff and carry them to San Francisco, but warned that there would only be limited space. Diana Adama, an American teacher living in Wuhan, told CNN that she was upset at the lack of information about the virus. But she said she didn't want to leave on the chartered flight if it meant carrying the virus back home. France is also planning to evacuate its citizens stuck in Hubei province by bus, and French carmaker PSA - which has a sizable presence in Wuhan - said was formulating plans to evacuate staff and relatives for quarantine. South Korea's consulate general in Wuhan conducted a poll on Sunday to determine the demand for a chartered plane for its citizens who want to return home, while Japanese PM Shinzo Abe said his country would fly out any nationals who wanted to leave. Singapore has already repatriated 20 airline staff and passengers who were quarantined in the eastern city of Hangzhou, according to the Straits Times newspaper.

"Dengue cases with marks of cold, cough increasing in Rajasthan | Jaipur News - Times of India","JAIPUR: If you have cold, cough and fever, don’t rule out dengue at a time when it is spiralling out of control. The cold, cough and fever are common symptoms of simple viral fever (common cold), but these symptoms have become common in dengue cases. Doctors are suspecting that the dengue virus has mutated and behaving differently. Even there are cases of dengue reported at Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital which is affecting lungs causing double pneumonia. “In swine flu and scrub typhus, double pneumonia is common but in dengue it was not. But the trend is changing now. There are patients with dengue who are admitted to the hospital with double pneumonia also known as bilateral pneumonia in which both lungs are infected,"" said Dr CL Nawal, senior professor (medicine) SMS hospital. Even there are cases of dengue reported at Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital which is affecting lungs causing double pneumonia. City-based doctors are finding it difficult to diagnose Dengue clinically. “We have seen six out of 10 patients with dengue, showing symptoms of cold, cough and fever. It has become quite difficult to differentiate between common viral fever or dengue clinically,” said Dr Ramji Sharma, assistant professor, Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital. The doctors claimed that at initial level, it has become difficult to diagnose dengue clinically. “Even in cold, cough and fever cases, we are advising people to go for diagnosis of dengue. It is surprising that more than 50% of the cases are being tested positive for dengue. It is quite unusual that dengue is causing upper respiratory infection at the onset of the fever,” said Dr Adil Aziz, consultant (medicine) of a private hospital. The doctors pointed out that earlier, the patients suffering from dengue complain about high grade fever, back or bone pain. “Unlike in simple viral fever, the symptoms of cold and cough vanishes in two-three days in dengue. In simple viral fever, cold and cough remain for more than five days. In current outbreak of the disease, after cold and cough vanishes in two-three days, the patients start showing symptoms of dengue, which are back pain abdomen pain, vomiting and bone pain,” said Dr Aziz. However, the common symptoms of dengue which is rashes has also not been reported commonly in dengue patients. ""In last month we have treated around 50 patients of dengue, out of which 10 were in a very serious condition. Nowadays, we see less number of Dengue cases in which the patient is experiencing rashes (Petechiae) whereas the people are facing more problems of swelling in the gall bladder, fluid in chest and abdomen and decreased appetite,” said Dr Sanjay Choudhary, Consultant- Pediatrics of a private hospital. He said that the most complicated cases they saw were of the patients who experienced kidney and liver failure due to dengue and they had to put them on the ventilator. “One of the patients had decreased platelets count along with the issue of increasing pulmonary edema, he was also put on a ventilator, and the patient survived"", said Dr Choudhary.

China deploys army medics to overwhelmed virus epicentre - Times of India,"WUHAN (CHINA): The Chinese army deployed medical specialists Saturday to the epicentre of a spiralling viral outbreak that has   killed 41 people   and spread around the world, as millions spent their normally festive Lunar New Year holiday under lockdown. The country's most important celebration has been all but cancelled for some 56 million people as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities. On Saturday, when they should have been celebrating, citizens of Wuhan stood in line at a pharmacy to buy masks from employees in full-body protective suits and surgical gloves. Coronavirus: All you need to know about symptoms and risksOn the eastern outskirts of Wuhan — Hubei's capital and the source of the previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) — police manning a roadblock turned away a handful of vehicles trying to exit the city. ""Nobody can leave,"" an officer told AFP. But the police allowed some medical workers who had gone home for the holidays to re-enter the city to help at overwhelmed hospitals. ""They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,"" said one of the women, pulling a suitcase. Coronavirus: China ‘shuts 10 cities; 12 quarantined in IndiaBut the respiratory contagion continues to spread. The nationwide death toll has jumped to 41, the government said Saturday, after 15 more people died in Wuhan. Confirmed infections also surged to 1,287, up from 830 reported 24 hours earlier. Most of the deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei. In a dramatic escalation of the central government's involvement, China deployed 450 military medical staff to Wuhan, state media said. The medics, who arrived on military aircraft late Friday, include doctors with experience combating SARS or Ebola and will be dispatched to hospitals that are reportedly short on beds due to a crush of infected patients and worried locals. Coronavirus: Symptoms &amp; preventionThe National Health Commission also ordered nationwide measures to detect people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses across the country. ""Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,"" said a man in a surgical mask at a Wuhan pharmacy where customers were stocking up on masks, gloves and disinfectant. But the man, who declined to give his name, expressed confidence in Chinese authorities. ""The government is handling this. It's not a problem."" The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and spread to a number of other countries. It has now spread nationwide and to a dozen other countries, with France saying three cases had been confirmed there — the first known European infections. Australia and Malaysia on Saturday became the latest countries to confirm infections. Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland, and a section of the Great Wall are among many attractions that have closed as a precaution. The New Year is usually a joyous occasion for family reunions, but not for many in Wuhan. ""Usually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I'm not even visiting my parents,"" said Wang Fang, a 49-year-old Wuhan native. ""It'll be great just to be able to make it through (the outbreak)."" China's aggressive response has won praise, especially compared to its handling of SARS, when it was accused of reacting sluggishly and stonewalling the international community. ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" US President Donald Trump tweeted, hours after the United States confirmed its second case. ""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,"" he added. ""It will all work out well."" The virus emerged at a bad time for containment, with hundreds of millions of Chinese rushing home for the holiday. The timing could limit the economic impact, however, since much of China normally shuts down anyway during the roughly week-long break. The outbreak emerged in late December, traced to a Wuhan seafood and live animal market that sold a vast range of exotic animals and other bushmeat. The World Health Organization on Thursday stopped short of declaring a global emergency, which would have prompted greater international cooperation, including possible trade and travel restrictions. Wuhan resembles a ghost town due to the clampdown, but hospitals bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits. The city's Guiyuan Temple is normally thronged for the Lunar New Year with tens of thousands of devotees paying respects to a deity associated with wealth. But police manning a roadblock on Saturday turned away AFP journalists, saying the temple was closed to prevent the virus's spread. Authorities began building a new field hospital in Wuhan to deal with the outbreak, which state media said could be ready in 10 days. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
Hong Kong declares Wuhan virus outbreak an 'emergency' - Times of India,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong on Saturday declared a new coronavirus outbreak as an ""emergency"" -- the city's highest warning tier -- as authorities ramped up measures to reduce the risk of further infections. The announcement came as city leader Carrie Lam faced criticism in some quarters over her administration's response to the crisis. Of the five people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, four arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland. That led to calls from some medical experts and politicians to limit, or even halt, arrivals from China, the epicentre of the outbreak with 41 people dead. Lam held emergency meetings with health officials on Saturday morning after returning from Davos. ""Today I declare the lifting of the response level to emergency,"" she told reporters. Schools and universities, which are currently on a Lunar New Year break, would remain closed until 17 February, Lam said. All mainland arrivals to Hong Kong will now need to sign health declaration forms, she added, while public events including a new year gala and next month's marathon, would also be called off. ""We haven't seen serious and widespread infections (in Hong Kong), but we are taking this seriously and we hope to be ahead of the epidemic,"" Lam said. Ho Pak Leung, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, said closing the mainland border would be the ""single most effective measure"" in containing the virus. Transport links with the mainland should be re-opened ""when the epidemic is controlled, when HK officials are awake, when there are enough masks and hand rubs for all Hong Kong citizens,"" he wrote on his Facebook page. Hong Kong has a recent experience of deadly viral outbreaks. Nearly 300 people were killed by SARS in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. The city's ability to combat the crisis was hampered by moves in mainland China to cover up and play down the outbreak, leaving a lasting legacy of distrust among many Hong Kongers. Animosity towards the mainland has intensified in recent years as Beijing tightens political control over the semi-autonomous territory. The outbreak also comes at a sensitive time for Lam, who has record low approval ratings after seven months of pro-democracy protests. ""We must stand united so that we can prevent and control the disease,"" she said, in a nod to the political unrest. The often violent protests have battered Hong Kong's reputation for stability and helped tip it into recession, with the recent virus outbreak compounding the city's economic woes. Hospitals are already struggling with the winter flu season, but officials are isolating anyone with a history of travel to central China and those exhibiting respiratory tract infections that look similar to the virus. So far some 300 people have been tested and monitored for the virus. Quarantine centres have been set up in remote holiday parks for anyone found to have come into close contact with people who tested positive. On Saturday, officials announced a newly built but still-empty public housing block would be used for medical staff on the frontline who did not want to risk returning to their families.

US investigating second suspected case of Chinese virus - Times of India,"HOUSTON: Authorities in Texas are investigating a second suspected case on US soil of a deadly Chinese virus, namely a college student who had recently returned from the city at the heart of the outbreak, officials said Thursday. Brazos County, just northwest of Houston, ""is investigating a suspected case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"" its health authority wrote in a statement on Facebook. ""The patient traveled from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated,"" it added. The patient's age is somewhere between 20 and 30 and they returned to the United States, where they are attending Texas A&M University, days before health screenings began at airports on January 15, local health official Eric Wilke told reporters. ""The person presented to an area emergency department yesterday mostly out of concern, not out of symptoms,"" said Wilke, adding that they were now being kept isolated at home while testing was performed, with the result likely to arrive over the next day. The patient had ""mild upper respiratory symptoms"" including cough and congestion and appeared to be improving. Such symptoms are common in the middle of winter flu season, but the patient was being screened further on the basis of their travel history. A blood sample has been sent to the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, which will provide a positive or negative result by Friday evening. If the case is confirmed, the patient would be the second person to be infected with the pathogen on US soil after a man in his 30s near Seattle reported himself to authorities on January 19. That man, a US resident who also recently traveled to Wuhan, is said to be recovering well and is due to be released from hospital soon. CDC officials had already warned that there would be more cases in the US given the frequency of international travel. All air traffic from Wuhan is currently being funnelled through five airports where health officials have been deployed to carry out screening with questionnaires and temperature checks. The new respiratory virus has claimed 18 lives since emerging from a seafood and animal market in Wuhan and infected hundreds more. China has locked down some 20 million people at the epicenter of the outbreak, but the World Health Organization said Thursday the disease did not yet constitute a global health emergency. But it has generated alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

Ready to deal with Chinese virus: Delhi hospitals | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The new deadly coronavirus infecting people in China has no cure at present. No vaccine exists either to prevent the disease. India, therefore, is on alert to prevent the spread of the infection here from China, where it originated. In case it does spread, top doctors say, the hospitals are well-equipped to handle the situation. The virus causes flu-like symptoms, for example cold, chills and respiratory distress. Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of AIIMS, told TOI that evidence so far suggests mortality rates of the virus aren’t very high. “The government has already put in thermal scanners at airports to detect possible cases. So far, there have been none. But even if such cases are found, we have enough infrastructure and expertise to contain the spread of the disease,” he said. AIIMS, Dr Guleria said, has a cubicle where six to seven patients can be isolated for treatment. “Depending on the requirement, we can increase the capacity of isolation wards 100% or more,” he said. Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) and Safdarjung hospitals, too, have infrastructure in place to create isolation wards at short notice. Infected people may be required to be separated from other patients and the general population. Like seasonal influenza, which is quite common these days, coronavirus infection also spreads from an infected person to others through the air, by coughing and sneezing or through close personal contact. Dr Amit Suri, consultant in medicine department at RML hospital, said maintaining hand hygiene and following respiratory etiquette is important to prevent the spread of the disease. According to Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant for internal medicine at Max Saket, not many people are aware of the new infection at present. “If a case is diagnosed in India, then people may panic. We need to have plan in place to educate the public about preventive measures if such a situation arises,” he said. Last year, scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) — the most important health research bodies in the country — had identified 10 emerging viral infections that could pose a threat to public health in India. The list included MERS-CoV, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to 26 countries. The Wuhan illness, as the new infection is being described because its epicentre is in the Chinese city called Wuhan, is of the same family that caused MERS-CoV. “National Institute of Virology, Pune is developing protocols to test the infection. In the next few days, more laboratories may be equipped to test people suspected to be infected,” Dr Chand Wattal, chairman of the microbiology department at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said. Union health secretary Preeti Sudan on Thursday said she has asked states and union territories to review hospital preparedness in terms of isolation and ventilator management of critically ill patients, identify gaps and strengthen core capacities like surveillance and laboratory support. Thermal screening is being done at the international airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin.

Wuhan virus compounds Hong Kong's economic woes - Times of India,"HONG KONG: The emergence of a SARS-like virus in China is the last thing Hong Kong's struggling economy needs, analysts say, as the city reels from the twin storms of the global trade war and months of political unrest. The semi-autonomous financial hub is currently on high alert for any appearance of the new coronavirus, which first surfaced in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread to the United States and around Asia. In 2003, nearly 300 people were killed in Hong Kong during an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also began on the mainland and hammered the city's economy as tourists arrivals plunged. ""We are on extreme high alert and preparing for the worst,"" chief secretary Matthew Cheung told reporters on Tuesday. ""We have not lowered our guard."" The timing could hardly be worse. Hong Kong has been tipped into a recession by the US-China trade war and months of seething pro-democracy protests that have upended its reputation for stability. On Monday, Moody's downgraded Hong Kong's credit rating, saying the government had failed to respond to the economic and political demands of protesters and that China's increased influence was undermining the city's once-vaunted institutions. A disease outbreak in the densely packed city would only add to current economic woes. ""This is definitely the last thing Hong Kong people want to see,"" said Jackson Wong, an asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. ""The current situation will definitely remind investors about what we suffered in 2003 during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong,"" he added. Hong Kong's stock market sank on Tuesday -- with tourism-linked stocks leading the losses — after a top Chinese scientist said the Wuhan virus has now been found to pass between humans. The brewing crisis comes days before the Lunar New Year holiday, which sees hundreds of millions of people travel across China and overseas. The number of mainland Chinese travelling to Hong Kong has dropped dramatically since the anti-government protests began last summer, and there are fears the Wuhan virus will only make things worse for the battered tourist industry. ""Hotel, catering and tourism have borne the brunt of the recession and now this situation is like rubbing salt into the wounds,"" Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities, told AFP. ""It will deal a heavy blow to the city's economic atmosphere. The impact of the political unrest sparked by the extradition bill (protests) has not yet ended."" Hong Kong's health authorities are taking few chances in a bid to stave off a repeat of the SARS epidemic. Monitoring for people with fevers has been ramped up at the airport and local hospitals to include anyone coming from Hubei province, not just its capital city Wuhan. More than 100 people who have come back from the region and reported flu-like symptoms have been isolated and treated, although none have yet tested positive for the new strain. But the spread of confirmed cases in multiple Chinese cities, including neighbouring Shenzhen, has put Hong Kong on edge with face masks rapidly selling out. Isolation wards and doctors are on standby. The SARS outbreak dramatically transformed Hong Kong into a place where the population is now far more conscious of contagion and hygiene standards. Door handles and lift buttons in the city's myriad skyscrapers are routinely sterilised multiple times a day, while an unguarded sneeze on the crowded subway can cause neighbouring commuters to scramble for distance. Surgical face masks are ubiquitous, not just in the winter flu season. Hong Kong's difficulties in battling SARS were compounded by the veil of secrecy that surrounded the outbreak on the authoritarian mainland. But specialists who are prepping the city for any new outbreak say they have been encouraged by the transparency Chinese authorities have shown following the Wuhan outbreak. ""The timescale of recognising, characterising, releasing and reporting information is a vast improvement from the time of SARS,"" Gabriel Leung, dean of the University of Hong Kong's medical school told reporters on Tuesday. ""What did take months during the time of SARS is now compressed into a matter of weeks or days,"" he added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
What's new today in the China virus outbreak - Times of India,"About 300 people have been diagnosed in an outbreak linked to a new virus in China. The illnesses began late last month in the city of Wuhan in central China, and six people have died. Scientists have identified the illness as a new kind of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS, though so far the new virus does not appear to be nearly as deadly. WHAT’S NEW TODAY?— The first U.S. case has been reported. The Washington state resident recently returned from a trip to central China and is hospitalized in good condition. Similar cases among Chinese travelers have also been identified in South Korea, Japan and Thailand.— In China, face masks sold out and officials checked airline and train passengers for fevers. Many people wore masks in Wuhan, but residents appeared to be carrying on with their regular activities.— Countries around the world are checking the body temperatures of arriving airline passengers who traveled to Wuhan. Officials hope the measures will slow the spread of the disease as millions of Chinese travel for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday.— Global financial markets stumbled on concerns that the virus spreading in the world’s second-largest economy could hurt tourism and ultimately economic growth and corporate profits.

China virus scare: Screening of flyers begins at KIA | Bengaluru News - Times of India,"BENGALURU: With the deadly novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection affecting more than 200 people and claiming three lives in China, doctors in Bengaluru are as concerned as their counterparts elsewhere in the world. While medical professionals feel growing passenger traffic between Bengaluru and China is enough cause for worry, authorities at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Monday sounded the first alert as a precautionary step. “Bengaluru airport has no direct flight to the affected cities in China. However, BIAL has taken precautionary measures to manage novel coronavirus cases. Based on the guidelines received from the Union ministry of health and family welfare, BIAL has set up a helpdesk at international arrivals. Thermal screening of passengers from Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur started on Monday,” said a BIAL spokesperson. Thermal imaging scanners used at airports can potentially detect if a person has fever. Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe ones like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). However, nCoV is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, according to the World Health Organisation. Meanwhile, the state health and family welfare department has deputed health assistants from Bengaluru Rural district to Airport Health Organisation, KIA, for passive surveillance of self-reporting passengers seeking medical assistance. The department on Friday held an orientation programme for district surveillance officers on nCoV infections. Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Health Sciences in Bengaluru and Wenlock Hospital in Mangaluru have been identified for treatment of any suspected case. “Till now, no suspected cases have been reported in Karnataka or India. However, if symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness are experienced during or after travel, passengers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with healthcare providers,” said Dr Prakash Kumar, joint director, communicable diseases, health and family welfare department. Novel coronavirus can be mistaken for common cold, cough and respiratory infections, given the similar symptoms. Novel coronavirus & its symptomsnCoV is a new variant of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulty. ‘Segregation has to start at airport’According to Dr Satyanarayana Mysore, HoD, consultant pulmonology, respiratory and sleep medicine, Manipal Hospitals, coronavirus belongs to the same family as the SARS virus. “Though there’s no immediate threat in Bengaluru, there are concerns as Wuhan, the worst affected city in China, is a transit hub. Asking for the travel history of a suspected person is essential. But we must also note that infection-control mechanism is strong worldwide, especially as countries have experience in handling SARS. Patient segregation has to begin at the airport itself,” he said. Dr Mysore added that respiratory infections see a spike from October to January, suggesting those with asthma, upper respiratory infections and underlying lung conditions get vaccinated for influenza. However, the influenza vaccine doesn’t provide blanket coverage and only shields one from influenza virus. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" As virus stalks China, India issues advisory | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: India has issued a travel advisory for those visiting China and stepped up surveillance at airports in the wake of an outbreak of coronavirus in China. Following reports of 41 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV), including one death in Wuhan in China this month, health ministry has instructed screening of travellers from the neighbouring country at Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata airports using thermal scanners. It has also advised people travelling to and from China to follow precautionary public health measures including avoiding travel to farms, live animal markets or where animals are slaughtered, and refrain from consuming raw or under-cooked meat. Coronavirus is a large family of viruses, which causes illnesses ranging from common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). They also circulate in animals including camels, cats and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can also evolve and infect people, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The advisory issued by the government stated that even though the mode of transmission of the novel coronavirus is unclear as of now and as per WHO’s assessment the risk of global spread is low, travellers to China are advised to take precaution and monitor their health closely. So far, only travel related cases of coronavirus have been reported (one each) in Thailand and Japan. The WHO on Thursday stated that not enough is known about the novel coronavirus to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted, clinical features of the disease, or the extent to which it has spread. Health secretary Preeti Sudan said the situation is being monitored in consultation with WHO. “The public health preparedness is being reviewed on day-to-day basis and the core capacities to timely detect and manage importation of the nCoV into the country are being strengthened further,” Sudan said. The ministry has also issued necessary directions to all those concerned on laboratory diagnosis, surveillance, infection prevention and control and risk communication. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme has been geared up for community surveillance and contact tracing. The National Institute Of Virology, Pune, and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) laboratory are coordinating testing of samples for the novel coronavirus (nCoV) in the country. Hospital preparedness with regard to management and infection prevention control facilities has also been reviewed during high-level meetings. Advisories and infection prevention and control guidelines have been shared with the states, the ministry said. According to WHO, the situation is still evolving and preliminary investigations suggest link to the sea-food market. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
China reports second death from new virus - Times of India,"BEIJING: A second person has died from a new coronavirus that has caused an outbreak of pneumonia in central China, health authorities said. A 69-year-old man surnamed Xiong fell ill with the respiratory condition on December 31, according to a statement late on Thursday from the Wuhan municipal health commission. He died on Wednesday. Xiong exhibited abnormal renal function, severe impairment in multiple organs, inflammation of the heart muscle and other pressing conditions when he was admitted to the hospital. It was not clear from the commission’s statement whether these were preexisting issues or consequences of the viral pneumonia. In total, 41 people in Wuhan have been diagnosed with a novel coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause both the common cold and more severe diseases like SARS and MERS. As of Thursday, 12 patients have been cured and discharged and five were being treated for acute conditions. Xiong’s is the second death tied with the outbreak. Last Saturday, a 61-year-old who had abdominal tumours and chronic liver disease died. Authorities have tracked over 700 people who were in close contact with infected patients. Two patients in Thailand and another in Japan have been diagnosed with the virus. The Chinese government is keen to avoid a repeat of SARS.

"Timely treatment of flu virus crucial, say doctors | Visakhapatnam News - Times of India","VISAKHAPATNAM: The Indian Association of Paediatrics (IAP), Vizag branch conducted a discussion on flu, its symptoms, prevention and vaccination to create awareness on the 101st year of flu outbreaks. Flu is a life-threatening disease caused by influenza virus. These viruses cause an infection in the respiratory tract or the nose, throat and lungs. The virus is inhaled or transmitted through fingers to the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose or eyes. Influenza is mainly caused by the H1NI and the H3N2 virus. Dr P Venkateshwarlu, the district president of IAP recommended accurate diagnosis and treatment of flu within 72 hours after symptoms appear to prevent flu-related mortality among children less than one year old, people above the age of 65 years and pregnant women. According to WHO’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk of flu is higher among these age groups. Therefore, the centre recommends timely vaccination and accurate treatment to prevent flu. Dr B Kasi, secretary of IAP Vizag said, “The symptoms of flu are not easily identifiable. People often confuse common cold with flu-like illnesses. The public should be aware of flu and its implication in order to take action within 72 hours.”  Dr PAV Lakshman Kumar, treasurer of IAP Vizag said symptoms of flu include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle ache, headaches and fatigue. “Delayed diagnosis can lead to a range of effects such as pneumonia. Up to 80% people hospitalised are at risk of severe infection and even death,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Until now, the deadly disease has killed more than 200 people and infected thousands in China, leading the World Health Organisation to declare a health emergency. On Friday, one ship was denied permission to allow its crew to disembark in Paradip. The ship is anchored 2 kilometres away from the port area. Dr Prahallad Panda, chief medical officer of Paradip Port Hospital, said, “On Monday and Thursday, crew members of two more ships were prevented from disembarking as the vessels had also anchored in countries hit by coronavirus before reaching Paradip port.” Port authorities, though, refused to disclose the details of the ships or where they were coming from and how many crew members were present inside. Sources said healthcare members would screen all crew members of the ships to detect if anyone is sick before deciding on whether to let them deboard. It is learnt that the process to screen the crew members could start on Saturday. “The measure is being taken to check the spread of the deadly coronavirus that has already reached in 22 countries. Due to that we, too, are on high alert in the port area and have to examine the health of all crew members since they have sailed through the affected countries,” Dr Panda said. “A special help desk has been set up at Paradip port on Monday to detect if anyone has been affected by coronavirus and to provide information to crew and others about the disease,” he added.

However, awareness in the border villages is the only instrument to identify and isolate any probable case from entering through unchecked routes,"" said Dr Mithlesh Chaturvedi, director for communicable diseases, directorate of health services, UP. Over 35,000 people with any kind of flu symptoms have been checked by government health teams on the SSB checkposts. Officials said that village heads, with the help of ASHAs and ANMs, will be apprised about warning signs of coronavirus which primarily include fever with cough, breathlessness and heaviness. ""Residents must stay vigilant towards the health of any visitor with Chinese connection or with flu. If a person is down with fever accompanied with breathlessness or heaviness, they should be sent to the nearest health facility,"" said Dr Chaturvedi. A helpline number is also being circulated among pradhans besides being publicised in general. Anyone who suspects of taking ill due to coronavirus may self-report and the health teams will track them for further diagnosis. UP districts have been divided into three categories for effecting surveillance. The first category comprises districts with airport/airstrips and those with heavy tourist activity. The list includes Lucknow, Varanasi, Agra, Gorakhpur and Allahabad. The second category comprises districts along the Indo-Nepal border.The remaining districts are in the third category.

Poverty forces two students from Maharashtra to brave it out in Wuhan amid coronavirus | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Even as an Air India Boeing landed in China on Friday to evacuate Indians from Wuhan, a few students don’t want to board it. Two PhD candidates from Maharashtra, Girish Patil (29) and Chandradip Jadhav (29), studying at the College of Materials and Metallurgy in Wuhan University of Science and Technology, have cited financial constraints as a reason. “We belong to lower middleclass families. If we travel now, we will have to incur expenses on our return,” said Patil, whose family, originally from Jalgaon, live in Dhule. Both support their families with scholarship money. “Our families are poor and dependent on us. We can’t waste money on travel,” said Patil. “We have seen many diseases in India and are not afraid of this one.” Patil and Jadhav are among six Indian students now in their university dormitory. Two others chose to fly back to India. “We are comfortable here. Embassy officials are in touch on a messaging app,” said Patil. “The university has given us an induction cooker and a microwave oven. We can step out for four hours a day to buy utilities. Though the canteen is open, we make our own meals. The streets have fewer people now, so it is a bit scary sometimes,” said Jadhav, whose family too live in Dhule. Their scholarship funds were released in advance this month. Patil and Jadhav travelled to China last November to pursue their course in material science and engineering. Many Chinese and Vietnamese students left the dormitory once a three-week vacation started on January 16, to join their families in Lunar New Year celebrations. After Wuhan’s lockdown following the virus outbreak, 50 students from various countries have stayed back. Patil and Jadhav said they chose to pursue PhD in China after their applications back home were rejected by universities several times. Patil, who has teaching experience and published papers to his credit, was put off by the requirement of having a PhD entrance test as a qualifier for research. He completed his BSc from Pune University and MSc from North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon. Jadhav, on the other hand, failed to crack PET and therefore chose to study abroad. They chose China over other countries as it has good research infrastructure and their supervisors were highly qualified in their areas of interest.

"Coronavirus in Hyderabad: Four new suspected Coronavirus cases in Hyderabad, government says no need to panic | Hyderabad News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: As four more persons with symptoms of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were admitted to state-run Fever Hospital on Friday, the health authorities urged people to avoid crowded places. “People should not panic about Coronavirus, but be careful and avoid crowded places as a precaution,” read a statement issued by the health department. In a huge relief for authorities, the much-awaited testing kits arrived from Delhi and the state government said they would begin testing samples within 48 hours in Hyderabad. The samples of the four persons, including a woman, were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune, along with two more samples for tests. These four persons are between 25 years and 40 years of age and travelled to China in the last fortnight. “With new suspected cases reported on Friday, we have a total of 15 suspected cases, of which nine have been tested negative. The report of six other samples are awaited from NIV Pune,” said Vijay Kumar, state nodal officer. Officials at Gandhi Medical College, where testing for Novel Coronavirus will begin, said that sufficient number of kits have arrived in the first batch. “Once the tests are done here, they will be sent to NIV Pune to check that the tests have been done correctly. After getting a go-ahead from NIV, all tests will be done locally,” said an official. Experts suggest maintaining high level of personal hygiene, exercise and self-isolation for 14 days in case people, who had travelled to China, witness symptoms. “Please do not send children to school if they feel sick. If a child has fever of 100F or above, he/she should rest at home until the fever is gone. If you have any health concerns, please consult with your physician or health care provider,” said Dr KK Agarwal, president of Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO), Heart Care Foundation of India (HCFI) and past national president of Indian Medical Association (IMA).

Coronavirus: WHO declares global virus emergency as death toll hits 213 - Times of India,"WUHAN: The World Health Organization declared a global emergency over the new coronavirus, as China reported Friday the death toll had climbed to 213 with nearly 10,000 infections. The UN health agency based in Geneva had initially downplayed the threat posed by the disease, but revised its risk assessment after crisis talks. ""Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing in Geneva on Thursday. ""We must all act together now to limit further spread... We can only stop it together."" Tedros nevertheless said travel and trade restrictions with China were unnecessary to stem the spread of the virus, which has spread to more than 15 other countries. Many countries have already urged their citizens not to visit China, while some have banned entry for travellers from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus first surfaced. The US reported its first case of a person catching the virus from another person on American soil -- a man in Chicago who contracted the illness from his wife, who had travelled to Wuhan. Airlines began cancelling flights servicing China on Wednesday, and more followed suit on Thursday. Israel barred all flights from China, while Russia said it was closing its far eastern border with China over the outbreak. More than 6,000 tourists were temporarily put under lockdown aboard a cruise ship at an Italian port after two Chinese passengers were isolated over fears they could be carrying the virus. They later tested negative for the illness. Beijing has taken extreme steps to stop the spread of the virus, including effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. The government on Thursday reported 38 new deaths in the preceding 24 hours, the highest one-day total since the virus was detected late last year. On Friday, the government reported 43 new deaths, bringing the total to 213. All but two of the confirmed deaths on Thursday and Friday were in Hubei. The National Health Commission said there were 1,982 new confirmed cases, bringing the total to just under 10,000. Another 102,000 people were under medical observation with possible symptoms of the respiratory ailment. The pathogen is believed to have emerged in a market that sold wild game, and spread during a Lunar New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home or abroad. Thousands of foreigners have been trapped in Wuhan since it was sealed off last week. Japan and the United States on Wednesday became the first countries to organise airlifts from Wuhan for their citizens. A second US flight is planned in the coming days. Britain was planning an evacuation of around 200 of its citizens early Friday, after receiving the necessary clearance from Beijing. A French plane also left Wuhan on Friday, according to an AFP journalist on board the flight. Australia and New Zealand were among others organising similar operations. Tokyo on Thursday reported that three people who were aboard the first evacuation flight had tested positive for the virus after landing back in Japan. Two of the three infected passengers showed no symptoms, underscoring the difficulty detecting the coronavirus. Compounding fears, Japan was allowing the arrivals -- more than 400 have been repatriated after a second flight on Thursday -- to ""self-quarantine"". In contrast, other countries organising evacuations said they were all planning to quarantine. The virus is similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pathogen. That outbreak also began in China and eventually killed nearly 800 people worldwide in 2002-03. Major airlines that have suspended or reduced service to China include British Airways, German flag carrier Lufthansa, American Airlines, KLM and United. Chinese efforts to halt the virus have included the suspension of classes nationwide and an extension of the Lunar New Year holiday. All football matches across the country also will be postponed, the Chinese Football Association said on Thursday, including games in the top-tier Chinese Super League. World stock markets tumbled again Thursday on fears that trouble in the ""world's factory"" would upset global supply chains and dent profits. Toyota, IKEA, Starbucks, Tesla, McDonald's and tech giant Foxconn were among the corporate giants temporarily freezing production or closing large numbers of outlets in China. Volkswagen announced Thursday its China joint-venture plants would not start production again before February 9. US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the coronavirus posed a fresh risk to the world economy. Throughout China, signs of paranoia multiplied, with residents of some Beijing residential compounds erecting makeshift barriers to their premises. In one of many similar photos posted online, a man wearing a surgical mask and brandishing a traditional martial arts weapon squatted on a barricade outside a Chinese village, near a sign saying: ""Outsiders forbidden from entering"". The crisis has caused food prices to spike, and the central government on Thursday blamed this partly on overzealous preventive measures, issuing a directive banning any roadblocks or other hindrances to food shipments.

Pune: 3 travellers test negative for novel coronavirus infection | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Throat swab samples of three travellers isolated at Naidu hospital tested negative for novel coronavirus infection on Thursday, allaying fears of the contagion reaching the city. “These travellers had recently returned from China and were isolated on Tuesday and Wednesday after they developed minor illness. Their throat swab samples tested negative for the novel coronavirus on Thursday. Earlier, two travellers had tested negative for the disease,” Ramchandra Hankare, chief of the health department at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said. He said the throat swab samples of the five isolated travellers would be retested at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in the next three days days. “They will be discharged if they test negative again,” Hankare said. A total of 4,846 passengers returning from China and other affected countries have been screened at the Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport since January 18. Of them, 28 travellers, who are residents of Pune, Mumbai, Pimpri Chinchwad, Kalyan, Vasai, Virar and Nanded, are under the surveillance for the next 28 days. Three from Kasturba hospital dischargedThree travellers quarantined for suspected coronavirus last week at Kasturba hospital at Chinchpokli in Mumbai were discharged on Thursday after they tested negative for the infection twice. Besides, two more individuals with travel history from China were admitted to the hospital on Thursday, taking the count of isolated patients in Mumbai to five. Overall, 11 patients are quarantined across the state, including five from Pune and one from Nanded. The discharged patients included a 31-year-old woman from Nalasopara, a 36-year-old man from Kalyan and a 65-year-old British national. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
What do we know about the new coronavirus? - Times of India,"A new coronavirus that has killed 213 people in China is spreading to other countries, alarming health experts. Here is some of what we know - and don't know - about the virus:  Where did the virus come from?The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species. The World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan at the end of December. Chinese authorities confirmed they had identified a new virus a week later. How dangerous is it?The new virus, identified by scientists as 2019-nCoV, is a coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. It is unclear how deadly the new virus is. Although severe cases can cause pneumonia and death, there may be many cases of milder disease going undetected. Many of those who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems. How is it transmitted and how can it be prevented?The coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person, although it is not clear how easily that happens. Most cases are in people who have been in Wuhan, family members of those infected, or medical workers. Transmission is most likely through close contact with an infected person via particles in the air from coughing or sneezing, or by someone touching an infected person or object with the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. In order to reduce the likelihood of transmission, the WHO recommends that people frequently wash their hands, cover their mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says those who develop symptoms such as coughing and fever who have been in China in the last 14 days should call ahead to a healthcare professional to establish if they need to be tested. There is no vaccine. Where has it spread?The vast majority of the almost 10,000 cases identified have been in China, mostly in and around Wuhan. The other countries with confirmed cases include Australia, Cambodia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, the UAE, the United States, and Vietnam. The WHO is looking closely at cases of person-to-person transmission outside of Wuhan, which would suggest that it may have the potential to spread further. There have been at least eight cases of human-to-human transmission in four countries outside China, including the United States, Germany and Japan. What are authorities doing?The Chinese government has put Wuhan into virtual quarantine to try to stop the spread of the virus. A number of foreign governments, including the United States, have advised against travel to China and have begun flying their citizens out of Wuhan. The WHO has not recommended curbs on travel or trade with China. Is this like SARS?The new virus is a strain of coronavirus, like SARS, which killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. Unlike SARS, which also originated in China, it is believed the new virus can spread during the incubation period of one to 14 days, possibly before an infected person is showing symptoms. The new virus does not appear to be as deadly as SARS, but there have been more cases overall. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
Dead man lies on an empty street at China's virus ground zero - Times of India,"WUHAN: A grey-haired man wearing a face mask lies dead on the pavement at ground zero of China's virus epidemic, a plastic shopping bag in one hand. On what would typically be a crowded street in Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million under quarantine, there are only a few passersby and they dare not go near him. AFP journalists saw the body on Thursday morning, not long before an emergency vehicle arrived carrying police and medical staff in full-body protective suits. The man lay straight on his back in front of a closed furniture store. Medical staff in blue overalls gently shrouded his body with a blue blanket. The ambulance left, and police stacked supermarket cardboard boxes to hide the scene. AFP could not determine how the man, who appeared to be aged in his 60s, had died. AFP contacted police and local health officials afterwards but could not get details on his case. But the reaction of the police and medical staff in hazmat suits, as well as some of the bystanders, highlighted the fear pervading the city. A woman standing near the man, wearing pink pyjamas and a Mao cap, said she believed he had died from the virus. ""It's terrible,"" she said. ""These days many people have died."" Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market into humans. The virus, which emerged late last year, has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China, with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone. With the virus spreading to other countries, the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency. Authorities have imposed an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan, blocking off roads out of the city and banning flights, in a bid to stop the virus spreading. Those who are trapped are enduring a tormenting wait for the lockdown to end, for a cure to be found, or even just for check-ups at overwhelmed hospitals. AFP reporters in Wuhan have seen long queues at hospitals, with some patients saying they had queued for two days to see a doctor. Many brought their own chairs for the wait. With most traffic banned, people who venture outside have to walk or bike everywhere in the huge city. The dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital, one of the main medical centres for treating those with virus symptoms. A team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits. One man smoking near the scene was told sharply by police to put out his cigarette and don a face mask. He quickly followed their orders. In the two hours that AFP observed the scene, at least 15 ambulances passed by, attending other calls. Finally, a white van with blacked-out windows arrived to take away the man. The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag, and carried into the van on a stretcher. Staff immediately began to clean the ground as the van drove away, disinfecting the streets where the body had lain. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
Coronavirus in Pakistan: Pakistan not to evacuate its citizens from virus-hit Wuhan to show 'solidarity' with China | World News - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan government has decided not to evacuate its citizens from the coronavirus-hit Wuhan city to show ""solidarity"" with its all-weather ally, a senior official announced on Thursday though four Pakistani nationals have contracted the deadly disease in China. There were up to 800 Pakistanis studying in various universities in Wuhan – a city of 11 million people which has been quarantined by the Chinese authorities in an effort to stem the spread of the deadly virus that has killed 170 people and infected nearly 8,000 others. Pakistan has decided not to evacuate its nationals from China in accordance with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza said. ""We believe that right now, it is in the interest of our loved ones in China (to stay there). It is in the largest interest of the region, world, country that we don't evacuate them now,"" he was quoted as saying by Dawn News. ""This is what the WHO is saying, this is China's policy and this is our policy as well. We are standing with China in full solidarity,"" he said. ""Right now the government of China has contained this epidemic in Wuhan city. If we act irresponsibly and start evacuating people from there, this epidemic will spread all over the world like wildfire,"" Mirza said. On Wednesday, Mirza confirmed that up to four Pakistani students in China were diagnosed with the coronavirus. ""That number remains at four. It has not increased,"" he said on Thursday. Mirza said that the Pakistan government's decision not to evacuate its people from Wuhan did not mean that it didn't care about them. He said Pakistan's embassy in China was in contact with the Pakistani citizens. He said that the government believes that China's policies to contain the virus were adequate. ""Government cares about its citizens just as much as their own families. But we don't want to take an emotional decision and become a reason for the spread of this disease,"" he said. However, some worried Pakistani students in Wuhan have complained that they are not being taken care of by the Chinese authorities and demanded immediate evacuation in a social media post earlier this week, The Nation newspaper reported. Unlike Pakistan, India has announced that it plans to evacuate its citizens, mostly students, from Wuhan city as well as from the worst-hit Hubei province from Friday. Earlier, Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said that the government had complete data of Pakistani students currently in China and was in touch with Chinese authorities to address any challenges the students may be facing. Farooqui lauded China's efforts to deal with the outbreak of the coronavirus and said Pakistan stood by China in this difficult time. A large proportion of the Pakistanis living in China were students of which over 500 students were based in the central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the new virus. Meanwhile, the FO spokesperson said the opening of the Pakistan-China border has been delayed until April due to the virus outbreak. The border crossing was previously scheduled to begin functioning in February, however, the Gilgit Baltistan government had sought a delay in the opening as a precautionary measure. As Gilgit Baltistan is Pakistan's closest region to China, precautionary measures are needed to prevent any possible threat of the spread of the disease to Pakistan, an official statement said.

Thousands held in cruise ship in Italy over feared coronavirus cases - Times of India,"CIVITAVECCHIA: More than 6,000 tourists were under lockdown aboard a cruise ship at an Italian port on Thursday after two Chinese passengers were isolated over fears they could be carrying the coronavirus. Samples from the two passengers were sent for testing after three doctors and a nurse boarded the Costa Crociere ship in the port of Civitavecchia to tend to a woman running a fever, the local health authorities said. Costa Crociere confirmed the ship, carrying some 7,000 people in total including the crew, was in lockdown. It came as China reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths and global fears deepened over a spread of the disease, with at least 15 countries confirming infections. Costa said a 54-year old woman from Macau ""was placed in solitary confinement in the on-board hospital last night with her travel companion"", and the crew was following instructions from the health ministry. The Costa Smeralda, the company's flagship and the fifth-largest cruise ship in the world, ""came from Palma de Mallorca and is currently engaged in one-week cruises in the western Mediterranean,"" it said. Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the government was ""not worried, but vigilant and cautious"". The couple flew in to Milan from Hong Kong on January 25, before getting on the cruise at Savona in northern Italy, according to Italian media reports. ""The couple's cabin has been isolated and they are in with the doctors,"" an unnamed passenger was quoted as telling ANSA news agency. ""We're a bit worried of course. No-one is getting on or off the ship apart from the doctors. This holiday risks ending in a nightmare"". The ship then stopped off in Marseilles and Barcelona, as well as Parma de Mallorca, according to an itinerary on its website. It had been due to sail for La Spezia in north Italy late Thursday, but would be detained in the Civitavecchia port near Rome ""until we have an update on the health tests,"" said port captain Vincenzo Leone. There are some 750 other Chinese passengers on board, who all appear to be in good health, media reports said. The World Health Organization, which initially downplayed a disease that has now killed 170 in China, was preparing to meet Thursday to decide whether to declare it a global emergency. Silvio Brusaferro, president of the Italian national health institute, said that all suspected cases in Italy so far had turned out to be false alarms, but the health service was ""ready should any cases of infection emerge"". Beijing has taken extraordinary steps to arrest the spread of the virus, including effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. The pathogen is believed to have emerged in a market that sold wild game, and spread by a Lunar New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically or abroad.

"Europe evacuation flight off to China, cruise ship checked - Times of India","LISBON (PORTUGAL): An A380 passenger plane left Portugal on Thursday en route to pick up hundreds of Europeans in China who want to escape the new virus and Italian authorities were keeping some 6,000 passengers on a cruise ship while they checked for a possible infection. The plane took off from a former military airport at Beja, 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Lisbon carrying just its pilots and crew. Captain Antonios Efthymiou said the flight would go first to Paris, where it would pick up a team of doctors and extra crew, before heading to Hanoi and then China. He told Portuguese media it would bring back about 350 Europeans. Efthymiou described the flight as ""a humanitarian mission."" He said the crew would take special medical precautions, but he did not elaborate. Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said the flight was coordinated between European Union countries and Chinese authorities. As concerns about the cornonavirus outbreak rippled across the world, two more European airlines halted services to China and a major European company shuttered its China stores. China has reported 170 deaths from the virus and at least 7,700 infections. More people have now been infected by this coronavirus in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. In Europe, there have been 10 confirmed cases of the virus: five in France, four in Germany and one in Finland. Italian health authorities, meanwhile, were screening passengers aboard a cruise ship docked north of Rome after a passenger from Macao came down with flu-like symptoms, officials said Thursday. The Costa Crociere cruise line said the 54-year-old woman and her partner, who has no symptoms, were immediately put in isolation Wednesday and the case reported to Italian maritime authorities. Passengers of the Costa Smeralda were being kept on board Thursday pending checks to determine the type of virus. The ship had sailed from Mallorca, Spain, to Civitavecchia on a weeklong Mediterranean cruise. On the retail front, Swedish furniture and home goods retailer IKEA announced all its stores in mainland China would remain closed to protect its customers and staff from the outbreak. The stores are a favorite haunt of Chinese city dwellers both for shopping and for hanging out. Scandinavian Airlines announced it was halting all its flights to Beijing and Shanghai due to the virus as of Friday until Feb. 9th. SAS, which has 12 regular weekly flights from Scandinavia to China, said Thursday that ""the safety of our passengers and employees is our highest priority."" Spain's Iberia national airline also halted the three return flights a week it runs between Madrid and Shanghai because of the virus. The company said the suspension would start Friday and continue through the month of February. Those announcements followed moves to halt or reduce flights to China by other European airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Swiss, Air France and KLM.

"Wary of irking China, Trump offers rosy take on virus threat - Times of India","WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump had plenty to talk about during his latest big campaign rally, regaling a friendly crowd in New Jersey with his thoughts about impeachment, the economy, the border wall, local politics and much more. But the president was conspicuously quiet about one big issue that has much of the globe on pins and needles: the spread of a deadly new type of coronavirus. A self-described germaphobe, Trump has had little to say in public about the new virus that so far has killed more than 170 people in China, sickened thousands more there and led to a handful of confirmed cases in the U.S. And he speaks in broad terms when he does talk about it. ""We're very much involved with them, right now, on the virus that's going around,'' Trump said of China before signing a trade deal at the White House on Wednesday. He said he had discussed the situation with Chinese President Xi Jinping and added, ""We're working very closely with China.'' Aides and confidants say Trump's careful approach is part of a political strategy crafted to avoid upsetting the stock market or angering China by calling too much attention to the virus or blaming Beijing for not managing the situation better, according to a White House official and a Republican close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted out photos from a briefing on the virus he attended with administration officials in the Situation Room, writing that ""we have the best experts anywhere in the world and they are on top of it 24/7!'' Just received a briefing on the Coronavirus in China from all of our GREAT agencies, who are also working closely w… https://t.co/3JD0tWoy2a— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1580342812000In keeping with the low-profile approach, the White House announced by email Wednesday night that the meeting included members of a task force that will lead the US response to the new virus. The 12-person team is chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and coordinated through the National Security Council. The president's comments contrast sharply with the fierce criticism he lobbed at his predecessor, President Barack Obama, during the 2014-15 Ebola crisis, which left more than 11,000 dead in three West African nations. At the time, Trump ripped into Obama as a ""dope"" and ""incompetent"" and called for a travel ban on visitors from Ebola-infected countries. Trump also advocated preventing infected American health care workers from coming home for treatment. Obama faced some criticism from public health officials for being slow to address the Ebola crisis initially, but also received plaudits for eventually attacking it with vigor. He nudged Congress to make a $5.4 billion emergency appropriation to aid the fight and sent 3,000 US troops to West Africa to help with the international response. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said he's taken a measure of comfort in the fact that Trump, so far, hasn't overreacted and has resisted ""fanning the flames'' as he did with his rhetoric during the Ebola crisis. That leaves room, Gostin said, for public health professionals to take the lead. ""As long as that continues and as long as there isn't political interference or mass quarantines in the US or outright travel bans, I will feel comfortable with how the White House is handling it,'' Gostin said. He added that he'd like to see Trump ask Congress for a $1 billion emergency appropriation to help agencies battling to contain the virus. Trump is well aware the virus outbreak in China could create a wild card for the US economy during an election year. And he has long prioritized the US economic relationship with China, especially during trade negotiations, and similarly largely held his tongue during widespread protests in Hong Kong. He also takes enormous pride in the personal relationship he's developed with Xi and has commended him for demonstrating ""transparency"" as he deals with the crisis. Trump said, ""we have it totally under control'' when he was asked about the new type of coronavirus while in Switzerland last week to attend an economic conference. And in a separate Twitter posting, he offered reassurance but scant detail for his confidence. ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" Trump tweeted. ""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well."" But some public health experts say Trump's rosy assessments of the situation don't match the ground truth. Gostin pointed to Chinese government bureaucratic delays that led to tens of thousands of people traveling outside of Wuhan province, increasing the likelihood that the virus will travel far beyond China. ""It's not accurate at all,'' Gostin said of Trump's assessment of China's handling of the outbreak. ""China manifestly does not have this under control."" Trump's budgets have proposed cuts to public health, only to be overruled by Congress, where there's strong bipartisan support for agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Indeed, the money government disease detectives are tapping to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional idea. The Department of Health and Human Services has accessed a $105 million fund lawmakers created to counter emerging threats from infectious diseases. That helps scientists to immediately deploy to help contain the outbreak, work on devising treatments for the virus, and investigate potential vaccines. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., an original sponsor of the idea, said the rapid response fund has proven its worth twice since it was set up in 2017. It was also tapped to help confront the most recent Ebola virus outbreak in Africa. Trump's Democratic presidential rivals have zeroed in on the president's efforts to reduce financing for public health organizations. Former Vice President Joe Biden and others have criticized Trump for eliminating a senior director position for global health security and biothreats at the National Security Council earlier in his term. Trump has also repeatedly sought budget cuts to the CDC and the National Institutes for Health. Congress resisted that, and the 2020 budget includes $8 billion for the CDC, $1.4 billion more than Trump's budget request. It also includes $41.7 billion for the NIH, $7.5 billion more than Trump's budget request. Biden wrote in an opinion article for USA Today this week that the ""possibility of a pandemic is a challenge Donald Trump is unqualified to handle as president."" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another Democratic contender for the 2020 nomination, tweeted that after the Ebola outbreak, Congress ""invested to prevent pandemics like coronavirus.

Coronavirus in China: India shares ‘evacuation’ forms with citizens stuck in Wuhan | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Indian embassy in Beijing on Wednesday started sharing “evacuation consent” forms online with Indians stuck in the coronavirus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan. A day earlier TOI had reported on the plight of Indians trapped in the city which is the epicentre of the virus outbreak. China has cut off access to Wuhan and 16 other cities in Hubei province to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. Many Indians TOI spoke to said they were running out of food and other provisions while strict limitations on their mobility had taken a mental toll. The form, shared with TOI by a member of the WeChat group ‘Indians in Wuhan’, read that those evacuated will undergo “a mandatory 14 days quarantine” on arrival in India. It added that the “individuals would be directly informed about the date and logistics of the evacuation”. ALSO READ: Coronavirus outbreak live updates: Kerala student is India's first confirmed caseThe form asked for full name, passport numbers, pick up location, details of contact person in India and whether the person was exhibiting any symptoms. It added that on the basis of medical checks as part of the evacuation process, a person could be rejected for evacuation or placed in quarantine in China. This clause seems to have added to their anxiety and confusion. Some said they have decided to opt out of the evacuation process. Gaurav Nath, a student at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology , told TOI, “What if they suspect us to be infected during the evacuation and put us in the hospital and we actually catch the infection there? It’s better to stay at the university.” Others who did not want to sign the form were concerned about missing their studies and worried about when they would be allowed to return. Earlier in the day, three students from Pakistan at WUST were admitted to the hospital on suspicion of infection. They were later cleared.

Three Japanese evacuated from Wuhan have new coronavirus - Times of India,"TOKYO: Three Japanese evacuated from the epicentre of a deadly new coronavirus outbreak have tested positive for the illness, the government said on Thursday as it faced criticism for the country's minimal quarantine measures. The new cases were announced as a second evacuation flight from Wuhan landed in Tokyo, and the government confirmed a second case of apparent person-to-person transmission of the virus in Japan. More than 400 people have now been repatriated to Japan from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak that has killed 170 people and infected thousands. But while returnees praised the government's effort to bring them home quickly, there has been criticism of Japan's decision to allow the arrivals to ""self-quarantine,"" with two people on the first flight even refusing to be tested for the virus. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said there were now 11 confirmed cases in Japan. ""In addition to the eight (previously known) cases, among the people who returned from Wuhan yesterday, infection has been confirmed in one person with symptoms and two other people who have no symptoms,"" he told Parliament. On Wednesday, authorities reported a second case involving someone who had not recently travelled to China. The woman was a tour guide who worked on the same bus as a driver who also contracted the virus without travelling to China. ""The eighth case is the second suspected incident of human-to-human transmission in Japan,"" Kato said. ""We are in a truly new situation."" Earlier on Thursday, 210 Japanese arrived on a second flight from Wuhan, with a third trip expected to collect remaining citizens. Medical professionals monitored those on board the planes, and 15 people from the first flight have been hospitalised with varying symptoms. Another 13 on the second flight reported feeling unwell, but it was not clear if any had been hospitalised. Japan is not forcibly quarantining arrivals, saying they lack the legal basis to confine people who have not tested positive for the virus. Instead, returnees have been asked to stay at home until they test negative for the virus. But Kato revealed that two people on the first flight had refused the test. ""This test is not mandatory and we ask for it on a voluntary basis,"" he told lawmakers. ""We don't have the legal basis to force them so we let them go home."" The two were asked to avoid public transport and quarantine officers will follow up on their health. Japan's approach sits in stark contrast with other countries that are isolating repatriated nationals for between 72 hours and 14 days. But regulations in Japan make similar measures difficult, and the law allows people to refuse testing, said Kazuo Kobayashi, head of the public hygiene department at the Osaka Institute of Public Health. ""(The authorities) can only make a request but it doesn't have binding power,"" he told AFP, declining to comment on the public safety implications. The government has decided to classify the new virus a ""designated infectious disease"", meaning it will be able to forcibly hospitalise those who test positive from February 7. But the rules on testing people with no symptoms will not be affected. Online there has been fierce criticism, with one Twitter user dubbing returnees who refused testing ""terrorists"". ""People talk about human rights, but how is quarantine discrimination?"" asked another, adding: ""Becoming the source of a pandemic would definitely be negative for a person who was released instead of quarantined."" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told parliament that the first flight was ""arranged in extreme chaos"" but that efforts were made to convince all those on the second flight to be tested for the virus. It was not yet clear, however, how many of them had agreed. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
 India reports first positive case of coronavirus; screening tightened at airports | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India on Thursday reported its first positive case of novel coronavirus (nCoV), increasing pressure on government to further tighten screening of passengers from abroad, particularly China, and augment health facilities to prevent any spread of the deadly virus. In a high level review meeting, the Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba decided that all those who have come from China after 15th January, 2020 will be tested as there in an incubation period for the virus. A student from Kerala, who was studying in Wuhan University and travelled to India, has tested positive for the virus, the health ministry said. ""The patient has tested positive for novel coronavirus and is in isolation at the hospital. The patient is stable and is being closely monitored,"" the ministry said. The government also stressed upon the need for 14 days’ home isolation for all those who have returned from China. As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The 2019 nCoV outbreak that has concerned health experts worldover started in China's Wuhan city early December last year and has so far infected at least 7711 in 31 provinces of China. Of this, 1370 were serious cases and 170 people have died. Most of the deaths were reported in elderlies with co-morbid conditions. Apart from China, 15 other countries have reported a total of 68 confirmed cases so far. In India, several states including Delhi, Haryana, Punjab Rajasthan have kept some people, with travel history to China, under observation after they showed n-CoV-like symptoms. With the virus spreading wider, the WHO has also decided to reconvene its Emergency Committee meeting on the 2019-nCoV on Thursday to consider declaring a global public health emergency. The committee will advise on recommendations to manage the outbreak. The health ministry in India maintained that it is fully prepared to handle any outbreak in the country. “Thermal screening sensors are operational and few more such equipment are being procured. The immigration and other staff members at the airports have been sensitized and dedicated ambulances are placed. Deployment of medical & para-medical staff is also being done for round-the-clock service,"" an official statement said. “Hospitals have prepared isolation wards, preparing for any contingency. Personal protection equipments and masks are available in adequate quantity in all the States/UTs.""

"Coronavirus China update: China virus death toll rises to 170, over 1,700 new cases | World News - Times of India","BEIJING: The death toll rose to 170 in the new virus outbreak in China on Thursday as foreign evacuees from the worst-hit region begin returning home under close observation and world health officials expressed ""great concern"" that the disease is starting to spread between people outside of China. Thursday's figures cover the previous 24 hours and represent an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,711. Of the new deaths, 37 were in the epicenter of the outbreak in Hubei province and one in the southwestern province of Sichuan. The news comes as the 195 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, the Hubei province city of 11 million where the outbreak originated, are undergoing three days of testing and monitoring at a Southern California military base to make sure they do not show signs of the virus. A group of 210 Japanese evacuees from Wuhan landed Thursday at Tokyo's Haneda airport on a second government chartered flight, according to the foreign ministry. Reports said nine of those aboard the flight showed signs of cough and fever. Three of the 206 Japanese who returned on Wednesday tested positive for the new coronavirus, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said during a parliamentary session. France, New Zealand, Australia and other countries are also pulling out their citizens or making plans to do so. World Health Organization emergencies chief said the few cases of human-to-human spread of the virus outside China — in Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam — were of ""great concern"" and were part of the reason the U.N. health agency's director-general was reconvening a committee of experts on Thursday to assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency. The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. Dr Michael Ryan spoke at a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday after returning from a trip to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government leaders. He said China was taking ""extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge"" posed by the outbreak. To date, about 99% of the cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it's likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed. In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS. Scientists say there are many questions to be answered about the new virus, including just how easily it spreads and how severe it is. In a report published Wednesday, Chinese researchers suggested that person-to-person spread among close contacts occurred as early as mid-December. ""Considerable efforts"" will be needed to control the spread if this ratio holds up elsewhere, researchers wrote in the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. More than half of the cases in which symptoms began before Jan. 1 were tied to a seafood market, but only 8% of cases after that have been, researchers found. They reported the average incubation period was five days. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."

China shuts down: The measures taken to curb a virus - Times of India,"BEIJING: China has enacted extraordinary measures to contain the spread of a new coronavirus that has killed more than 130 people, infected thousands and reached some 15 countries. Here is a rundown of the steps taken so far in an unprecedented effort: More than 56 million people are subject to travel curbs in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected. Public transport has been stopped in 18 cities there, with train stations shut, events cancelled and theatres, libraries and karaoke bars closed in some locations. The epicentre of the outbreak is provincial capital Wuhan, the biggest city on lockdown, where the government has halted all travel out of the Yangtze River metropolis of 11 million. Wuhan residents have been urged to stay home and authorities have restricted car traffic in the city centre. Similar quarantine measures are being taken in nearby cities, with strict controls on weddings and funerals, temperature screenings for new arrivals, and the suspension of online taxi services. The US and Japan airlifted out some of their trapped nationals on Wednesday. Europeans plan a similar operation this week. Beijing, Shanghai and other megacities have suspended the entry and departure of long-distance bus services. At least 2,000 inter-province train services have been cancelled since Friday -- most until February 8-9 but some for weeks. Chinese authorities have also asked citizens to delay international travel to stop the virus from spreading elsewhere overseas. Authorities had already suspended both domestic and overseas Chinese group tours over the weekend. Tourists from Hubei in Haikou, capital of the island province of Hainan, were told by the city government they had to spend 14 days in a hotel for centralised medical observation, and were forbidden to leave. Hundreds of millions of people criss-crossed the country last week for family reunions for the Lunar New Year holiday, in what is typically a joyous time of gatherings and public celebration. Instead, public health officials asked China's 1.4 billion citizens to confine themselves at home until all is clear. Schools and universities across the country were ordered not to reopen until further notice on Tuesday, a day after the holiday break was extended to try and reduce the spread of the virus. Wuhan and Beijing had earlier cancelled public events that usually attract hundreds of thousands of people to temples during the New Year holiday. Beijing's Forbidden City, a sprawling imperial palace, was closed from Saturday. Other famous landmarks including a section of the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs and Yinshan Pagoda also shut. Tibet's Potala Palace was shut down on Monday. Disneyland theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have closed down indefinitely. Women's Olympics football qualifiers scheduled for next week in Wuhan have been moved out of the country and will now be held in Sydney. China's film box-office earnings for Lunar New Year's Eve on Friday were just one-tenth of last year as people shunned crowds. US coffee chain Starbucks said it had shut all its stores in Hubei during the holiday break and more than half of its stores around the country. China has ordered sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains, while travellers are being screened for fever. Temperature screening checkpoints have been set up in hundreds of Chinese railway stations, according to state news agency Xinhua. Authorities have asked people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air and wear protective face masks. City authorities in Wuhan have gone further and made it mandatory to wear masks in public places. A similar order was issued in southern Guangdong province, which has 110 million people. With people rushing to get masks at pharmacies and on popular websites, China's industry and information technology ministry vowed to increase supply. Authorities in Wuhan are rushing to build two field hospitals by next week to ease pressure on medical facilities in the city that are struggling to handle a growing caseload. The first facility is expected to be operational by next Monday and will have a capacity of 1,000 beds spread over 25,000 square metres, according to state media. The second is slated to open two days later with 1,300 beds. The two new hospitals will be similar in size to the temporary facility built to tackle SARS in Beijing in 2003, when 650 people died from the disease in the mainland and Hong Kong.

 India among top 30 countries at 'high risk' from coronavirus spread: Study | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India is among the top 30 countries at ""high-risk"" from the spread of the deadly coronavirus, according to a study based on the number of air travellers predicted to arrive in the countries from the worst affected cities in China. Researchers from the University of Southampton in the UK compiled a list of cities and countries they believe are at high risk from the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - which has killed over 100 people so far, and infected thousands. The most ""at risk"" countries or regions worldwide are Thailand (1), Japan (2), and Hong Kong (3). The US is 6th on the list, Australia 10th, the UK 17th and India 23rd, the researchers said in the study released on Tuesday. According to the study by the university's WorldPop team, Bangkok in Thailand is currently the city most at risk from a global spread of the virus. Hong Kong is second on the list, followed by Taipei in Taiwan. Sydney, New York and London are among the top 20 other major international cities ranked in the research, released on Tuesday. Within mainland China, the cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chongqing are all identified as high-risk by the researchers, along with the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Henan. ""It's vital that we understand patterns of population movement, both within China and globally, in order to assess how this new virus might spread - domestically and internationally,"" said Andrew Tatem, a professor at the University of Southampton. ""By mapping these trends and identifying high-risk areas, we can help inform public health interventions, such as screenings and healthcare preparedness,"" Tatem said. The team used anonymised mobile phone and IP address data - which helps to identify devices - along with international air travel data to understand typical patterns of movement of people within China, and worldwide, during the annual 40-day Lunar New Year celebrations. From this, they identified 18 Chinese cities - including Wuhan - at high-risk from the new coronavirus, and established the volume of air passengers likely to be travelling from these cities to global destinations over a three month period. The team, including researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada, and the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, was then able to rank the top 30 most at-risk countries and cities around the world. The researchers acknowledge that their analysis is based on 'non-outbreak' travel patterns, but highlight that a high proportion of people travelled with symptoms at an early stage of the outbreak, before restrictions were put in place. Travel cordons are likely to have only coincided with the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan for the holiday period, the researchers noted. According to Wuhan authorities, it is likely that more than five million people had already left the city, they said. ""The spread of the new coronavirus is a fast moving situation and we are closely monitoring the epidemic in order to provide further up-to-date analysis on the likely spread,"" said Shengjie Lai from the University of Southampton.

"Bird flu scare hits sale of chicken, eggs | Bhubaneswar News - Times of India","BHUBANESWAR: Shops selling chicken wear a deserted look in the city ever since news spread of the detection of bird flu virus in the poultry farm of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) three days ago. There has been almost a 50 per cent drop in the sale of broiler and country chickens in the markets. The chicken vendors in big markets have had to keep the stock of chicken without slaughtering them waiting for the customers. “Earlier, we used to dress and keep the chicken ready beforehand. The stock would get exhausted quickly. But, now, due to the panic among people, we are keeping only livestock. Only when people ask for it do we cut the chicken,” said Manas Swain, who runs a poultry shop at Indradhanu market, one of the biggest markets in the city. Manas said his small shop used to exhaust 100 kg of dressed chicken every day. But now only half of it sells. “Household consumption has fallen drastically. Whatever we sell is because of the bulk order from hotels. But even hotels have started ordering less,” he added. Meanwhile, culling continued for the second consecutive day. The animal husbandry department deployed 14 rapid response teams (RRTs) for surveillance and culling of birds within one km radius of the epicentre of the affected area — the OUAT poultry farm. “Five RRTs culled 80 birds, disposed of 1059 eggs and 10 kg poultry feed. Out of the birds, 38 were layer chicks, 38 layer adults and four adult ducks,” said Ratnakar Rout, director, animal husbandry department, adding that the government paid compensation of Rs 25,904 to the chicken vendors. Sheikh Anwar, a bulk supplier of chickens, said he used to transport 10,000 birds every alternate day for supply to at least 30 shops. He expects chicken prices to slide. “The price of chicken, selling at Rs 180/kg (for dressed broiler), will start falling. Experts say if the chicken is boiled at more than 70 degrees centigrade, there will be no virus. Still people are panicking,” Anwar said. Riddhima Panda, a home-maker said she has to drop chicken curry from the menu because of the H5N1 virus. “I know if we boil for long, there won’t be any harm. But still the fear lingers. We even stopped having eggs,” she said. EoM Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Coronavirus alert in Madhya Pradesh after mother-son duo sent to isolation ward in Ujjain | Indore News - Times of India,"INDORE: A day after an Indian medical student from Wuhan and his mother were admitted to a hospital on suspicion of contracting novel coronavirus (nCoV) in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh government on Tuesday sounded an alert for the virus that has claimed 106 lives in 11 nations. Instructions have been issued to health department principal secretary and commissioner to make required arrangements at the district and civil hospitals in all the districts to combat the virus, State health minister Tulsiram Silawat said. “The state government is working on all possible fronts to check spread of the said virus,” he said. Silawat’s announcement came barely 24 hours after a medical student from Wuhan and his mother were admitted with cold-like symptoms and breathlessness at Madhav Nagar hospital in Ujjain. “Coronavirus is a serious issue but we will deal with it with full responsibility. We are expecting the blood sample report on the Ujjain patients from Pune.,” the minister said. Hours after the alert was sounded, a high-level meeting of various department heads of MGM Medical College was held and it was decided to start a six-bed isolation ward in the TB and Chest wing of the MY Hospital complex for the suspected nCoV cases. “Two ventilators would be assigned to the ward with adequate number of doctors and nurses,” medical college dean Dr Jyoti Bindal said in a release. People returning from China with cold, cough and fever will be kept in a triple layer seal in the quarantine zone, she said adding their samples will be sent to National institute of Virology, Pune. The suspected patients will be kept under intensive observation for 14 days and followed up after discharge, Dr Bindal said. Doctors at Madhav Nagar hospital in Ujjain claimed that the condition of mother son-duo was stable. “They are kept under constant observation. All parameters are being recorded,” Ujjain chief medical and health officer Dr Mahavir Maheshwari said. Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has so far killed 106 people and affected 4,515 people in China is a novel strain and not seen before. The virus is believed to have emerged from a seafood and animal market in China's Wuhan. The medical student admitted to the Ujjain hospital claimed that chances of him having contracted the virus are slim. “I am a vegetarian. The virus seems to have spread from non-vegetarian food. Chances are less that I might have contracted the disease,” he told TOI. He claimed that he presented himself before the doctors following guidelines issued by the central health ministry about mandatory screening of people returning from China. The medical student, elder of two siblings, was in Harsood to attend a family function, when he received a call from Delhi asking him to get screened. “Subsequently, we returned to Indore and met the doctor,” he said. Ujjain district collector Shashank Mishra said, “We are trying to identify people who have come in contact with the mother-son duo. Appropriate action will be taken once the reports are received from Pune.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

One placed in GMC’s isolation ward for suspected Coronavirus | Goa News - Times of India,"PANAJI: A traveller who arrived in Goa from China’s Kunshan city a week ago has been placed in the isolation ward of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, for suspected Coronavirus. The patient’s blood and nasal swab samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for testing. “All preliminary steps have been taken,” said state health secretary Sanjay Kumar, who chaired the first meeting of the newly-constituted task force on Tuesday. “A sample has been sent for laboratory testing.” Director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa said he was under observation as he complained of a sore throat. “He is just a traveller,” D’Sa said. “His wife and he arrived from China a week ago. He had visited Kunshan, which is around 750km away from Wuhan.” Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, is where the first case of the new Coronavirus was reported last month. Apart from GMC, the Goa government has made provisions at the Cottage hospital, Chicalim, where a ward of seven beds has been reserved for quarantining suspected Coronavirus cases. “The Cottage hospital has been selected because it’s close to the Dabolim airport,” D’Sa said. In Bambolim, GMC’s isolation ward has 30 beds, and dean Dr S M Bandekar said that an ICU with two beds would be added. Meanwhile, Kumar said selected airports that receive direct flights from China have thermal screeners. While he said that Goa currently doesn’t have the device, as a precautionary measure, a request to install one at the Goa international airport has been placed. Kumar said that the state government has taken preliminary steps and preparatory measures and is in a “comfortable position” to deal with cases that may be detected.

Coronavirus: Permanent medical unit soon to screen flyers at Lohegaon facility | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: With most of the country on its toes for any signs of coronavirus, the city airport is set to get a permanent virus screening facility. The facility — to be staffed by qualified medical professional — is being set up by Airports Authority of India in coordination with the Union health ministry, an airport official close to the development said. Currently, seven airports across the country — not including Pune — have been instructed to screen and check passengers in the wake of the global coronavirus outbreak. “The airport authorities have provided space in the terminal building for the unit,” the official said, adding that work was underway. “It will take 10 days to be ready,” the official added. The facility will be equipped to vaccinate — and if necessary, quarantine — any passenger infected with any virus. G Chanderamouli, AAI’s western regional director, said the immigration desk and customs officials are keeping a close eye on arriving international passengers. “The passengers’ points of origin are being monitored. Any suspicious case will be referred to the medical team,” Chanderamouli said. Customs officials said they had sent 3 to 4 people — who had come to Pune from China via Dubai — for a general check-up after some suspicions.

Assam vigil to stop Coronavirus outbreak | Guwahati News - Times of India,"GUWAHATI: With vigil being stepped up across all states in view of the Coronavirus outbreak in China, Assam health department has issued advisories to the joint directors of health services stationed in the districts to screen persons for suspected case of Coronavirus infection if they have returned from China or Nepal, or have come in contact with people who have visited the two countries. Director of health services, Assam, Rathindra Bhuyan told TOI on Tuesday that isolated observation beds have been set up in district hospitals and medical colleges of the state to treat patients in case anybody is found to be affected by Coronavirus. ""We have asked the health officials in the districts to be on alert and screen persons if they are suspected to be affected. This is especially for persons who have visited China or Nepal, or come in contact with those who visited the two countries,"" said Bhuyan. He added that the joint directors have been asked to screen these persons while looking out for symptoms such as fever or cough. If any suspected case is detected during screening, the patient's samples will be sent to National Institute of Virology in Pune. Minakshi Devi, state surveillance officer of Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP), said they are relieved that these persons are being screened by health experts in airports outside the state before they can come to Assam. Guwahati does not have direct flight connectivity with any of the cities in China or Nepal. However, IDSP has still asked the medical staff based in the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport to be on alert. Sources in the health department said that entry of people from Nepal to Assam through roadways may become a cause of worry if Coronavirus keeps spreading fast in the neighbouring country. ""It's easy to screen the visitors from China in the airports where there is watertight security. But it is really difficult to keep track of people coming from Nepal through the border points,"" said a health department official. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Deaths rise to 132 in China outbreak as foreigners leave - Times of India,"BEIJING: Countries began evacuating their citizens Wednesday from the Chinese city hardest-hit by an outbreak of a new virus that has killed 132 people and infected more than 6,000 on the mainland and abroad. A Japanese flight carrying evacuees home included four people with coughs and fevers. The three men and one woman were taken to a Tokyo hospital on separate ambulances for treatment and further medical checks. It wasn't immediately known whether they were infected with the new type of coronavirus that appeared in the central city of Wuhan in December. Its symptoms, including cough and fever and in severe cases pneumonia, are similar to many other illnesses. China's latest figures cover the previous 24 hours and add 26 to the number of deaths, 25 of which were in the central province of Hubei and its capital, Wuhan. The 5,974 cases on the mainland marked a rise of 1,459 from the previous day, although that rise is a smaller increase than the 1,771 new cases reported on Monday. Dozens of infections have been confirmed abroad as well. Chartered planes carrying evacuees home to Japan and the United States left Wuhan early Wednesday as other countries planned similar evacuations from areas China has shut down to try to contain the virus. The lockdown of 17 cities has trapped more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. A plane carrying Americans who had been in Wuhan left for Anchorage, Alaska, where they will be rescreened for the virus. U.S. hospitals are prepared to treat or quarantine people who may be infected. After departing Alaska, the plane is to fly to Ontario, California. At the Tokyo airport, Takeo Aoyama, an employee at Nippon Steel Corp.'s subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters he was relieved to be able to return home. ``We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly and we were still in the city,'' Aoyama said, his voice muffled by a white surgical mask. Tokyo Metropolitan Government confirmed the condition of the four ill passengers after the flight of 206 Japanese evacuees arrived. They were taken in separate ambulances to a Tokyo hospital for treatment and further health checks. All of the passengers had their temperatures checked before boarding and on the plane, and plans had been made for all of the evacuees to be treated and quarantined depending on their test results. Several countries have confirmed cases of the virus, with most of them being Chinese visitors, people who visited Wuhan or family members in close contact to the sick. Japan's six confirmed cases include a tour bus driver who drove visiting groups from Wuhan. Germany says four workers at an auto parts company possibly were infected when a colleague from Shanghai visited. Australia and New Zealand were the latest countries planning evacuations. Both countries also stepped up their travel advice to China, as did Britain. Experts have feared travel during the Lunar New Year holiday would enable the further spread of the virus, and China expanded the holiday to keep people home, closing schools and offices to try to contain it. Hong Kong's leader said the territory will cut all rail links to the mainland and halve the number of flights. Mongolia and North Korea were closing their borders with China, and many places have curtailed flights or are screening travelers arriving from China. Wuhan is building two hospitals in a matter of days to add 2,500 beds for treatment of patients with the virus. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS. The source of the virus and the full extent of its spread are still unknown. However, the World Health Organization said most cases reported to date ``have been milder, with around 20% of those infected experiencing severe illness.'' On Tuesday, WHO's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss the latest information on the outbreak and reiterate their commitment to bringing it under control. ``The National Health Commission presented China's strong public health capacities and resources to respond and manage respiratory disease outbreaks,'' WHO's statement said. It said discussions focused on ways to cooperate to contain the virus in Wuhan and other cities and provinces and studies that could contribute to the development of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and treatments. Other WHO experts will visit China as soon as possible, it said. ``Stopping the spread of this virus both in China and globally is WHO's highest priority,'' Tedros said.

Hong Kong halts trains from mainland China as virus spreads - Times of India,"BEIJING: Hong Kong's leader has announced that all rail links to mainland China will be cut starting Friday as fears grow about the spread of a new virus. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday that both the high-speed rail station and the regular train station would be closed. China's death toll from a new viral disease that is causing mounting global concern rose by 25 to at least 106 on Tuesday as the United States and other governments prepared to fly their citizens out of the locked-down city at center of the outbreak. The total includes the first death in Beijing, the Chinese capital, and 24 more fatalities in Hubei province, where the first illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus occurred in December. Asian stock markets tumbled for a second day, dragged down by worries about the virus's global economic impact. The U.S. Consulate in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where authorities cut off most access Jan. 22 in an effort to contain the disease, was preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the city on Wednesday. Japan and South Korea said they would send planes to Wuhan this week to evacuate their citizens. France, Mongolia and other governments also planned evacuations. China's increasingly drastic containment efforts began with the suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to 17 cities with more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed. China extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Sunday to reduce the risk of infection by keeping offices and factories nationwide closed and the public at home. Authorities in Shanghai, a global business center and home to 25 million people, extended the holiday in that city by an additional week to Feb. 9. U.S. health officials expanded their recommendation for people to avoid non-essential travel to any part of China, rather than just Wuhan and other areas most affected by the outbreak. Mongolia closed its vast border with China and North Korea said it was strengthening quarantine measures. Hong Kong and Malaysia are barring visitors from Hubei. Chinese travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide. There were 1,771 new cases confirmed in China on Monday, raising the national total to 4,515, according to the National Health Commission. It said 976 people were in serious condition. The government has sent 6,000 extra medical workers to Wuhan from across China, including 1,800 who were due to arrive Tuesday, a commission official, Jiao Yahui, said at a news conference. A baby boy was delivered by surgery in Wuhan after his 27-year-old mother was hospitalized as a ``highly suspected'' virus case, state TV reported. The mother, who has a fever and cough, was 37 weeks pregnant, or two weeks less than a standard full term. Doctors wore protective masks and clothing for the delivery Friday at Union Hospital. ``It was unlikely for her to be able to give natural birth,'' said the hospital's deputy director of obstetrics, Zhao Yin. ``After the baby was born, the mother would suffer less pressure in her lungs and she could get better treatment.'' Also Tuesday, the Education Ministry canceled English proficiency and other tests for students to apply to foreign universities. The ministry said the new semester for public schools and universities following Lunar New Year was postponed until further notice. The Hong Kong government announced some government offices would remain closed until at least Monday and non-essential public employees were allowed to work from home. Chinese financial markets were closed for the holiday, but stock indexes in Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney all declined. Beijing's official response has ``vastly improved'' since the 2002-03 SARS outbreak, which also originated in China, but ``fears of a global contagion are not put to bed,'' said Vishnu Varathan at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. Airlines, resorts and other companies that rely on travel and tourism suffered steep losses. Prices of gold and bonds rose as traders moved money into safe haven holdings. The Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the world's busiest, announced it was postponing the resumption of trading after the holiday by three days to Monday. Scientists are concerned about the new virus because it is closely related to other diseases including SARS, which killed nearly 800 people. So far, the new coronavirus doesn't seem to spread as easily among people as SARS or influenza. Most of the cases that spread between people were of family members and health workers who had contact with patients. That suggests the new virus isn't well adapted to infect people. China has reported eight cases in Hong Kong and five in Macao, and more than 45 cases have been confirmed elsewhere in the world. Almost all involve mainland Chinese tourists or people who visited Wuhan. On Tuesday, Taiwan said two 70-year-old tourists from Wuhan had been confirmed to have the disease, raising its total to seven cases. Thailand reported six members of a family from Hubei were new cases, raising its total to 14. Germany confirmed its first case late Monday. Infections also have been confirmed in the United States, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Canada, Australia and Sri Lanka. The five American cases _ two in southern California and one each in Washington state, Chicago and Arizona _ are people who had recently arrived from central China. Health officials said they had no evidence the virus was spreading in the United States and they believe the risk to Americans remains low. During the SARS outbreak, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak. Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week. The coronavirus family includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia. The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a Wuhan market. China on Sunday banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them.

Dozens of infections of the new type of coronavirus have been confirmed outside mainland China as well. A Japanese chartered flight carrying 206 evacuees from Wuhan included some who had coughs and fever on the plane, Kyodo News reported, citing health ministry officials. They were expected to be taken by ambulances to a Tokyo hospital specializing in infectious diseases. Takeo Aoyama, an employee at Nippon Steel Corp.'s subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters he was relieved to be able to return home. ""We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly and we were still in the city,"" Aoyama told reporters, wearing a white surgical mask that slightly muffled his voice. Another of the evacuees, Takayuki Kato, said their temperatures were taken before the plane left Wuhan and again by a doctor on board. Both Kato and Aoyama said they didn't see anyone with obvious symptoms or feeling ill near their seats. All of the passengers were expected to undergo further health checks and were expected to stay home until a lack of infection was confirmed. Aoyama said more than 400 Japanese people wishing to return to Japan are in Wuhan, including those who are working for a Japanese supermarket chain that stays open to serve customers who need food. He said it is important to step up preventive measures in Japan, but ""I hope we can also provide support for the Chinese people, which I think would also help the Japanese people who are still there."" A plane carrying Americans who had been in Wuhan left for Anchorage, Alaska, where they will be rescreened for the virus. Hospitals are prepared to treat or quarantine people who may be infected. Then the plane is scheduled to fly to Ontario, California. The British government is warning against ""all but essential travel"" to mainland China amid the outbreak of the new type of coronavirus. And Hong Kong's leader said the territory will cut all rail links to the mainland and halve the number of flights to stop the spread of the virus. South Korea also said it will send a plane, and France, Mongolia and other governments also planned evacuations. China has cut off access to Wuhan and 16 other cities in Hubei province to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. The lockdown has trapped more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. The Japanese flight was bringing 20,000 face masks as well as protective gear, all in short supply as Chinese hospitals treat a growing number of patients. Wuhan is building two hospitals in a matter of days to add 2,500 beds for treatment of patients with the virus. The sharp rise in infections recently suggests significant human-to-human spread of the virus, though it could also be explained by expanded monitoring efforts, said Malik Peiris, chair in virology at the University of Hong Kong. Experts worry the new virus may spread more easily than originally thought, or may have mutated into a form that does so. It is from the coronavirus family, which also can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS, which both emerged in the past two decades and are thought to have come from animals. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.

WHO says global risk of China coronavirus is 'high' - Times of India,"GENEVA: The World Health Organisation on Monday said the global risk from the deadly virus in China was ""high"", admitting an error in its previous reports that said it was ""moderate"". The UN health body said in a situation report published late Sunday that the risk was ""very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level"". In a footnote, the WHO said there had been an ""error"" in previous communications published on Thursday, Friday and Saturday which ""incorrectly"" said the global risk was ""moderate"". Asked for more detail, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said only that it was ""an error in the wording"". The WHO on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus an international public health emergency -- a rare designation used only for the most severe outbreaks that could trigger more concerted international action. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is visiting China this week to discuss further action to contain the virus, on Thursday said: ""This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency."" WHO's cautious approach can be seen in the context of past criticism over its slow or too hasty use of the term, first used for the deadly 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. During that outbreak, the UN health agency was criticised for sparking panic-buying of vaccines with its announcement that year that the outbreak had reached pandemic proportions, and then anger when it turned out the virus was not nearly as dangerous as first thought.

Germany confirms 1st case of new virus from China - Times of India,"BERLIN: Authorities in Germany have confirmed the country's first case of the new virus that emerged in central China. The Health Ministry in the southern state of Bavaria said late Monday that the man from Starnberg, south of Munich, is ``in a clinically good condition.'' Officials said the man is being medically monitored and isolated. Persons who were in close contact with the man are being informed about possible symptoms and hygiene measures. The ministry said it considers the risk to the general population in Bavaria to be ``low.'' Germany is the second European country to report a confirmed case of the virus. Authorities in France confirmed three cases in recent days _all Chinese citizens who recently returned from travels there. A spokesman for Bavaria's Health Ministry, Joerg Saeuberlich, was unable to say whether the Bavarian case involved recent travel to China. He said authorities to provide new details at a news conference in Munich at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT). The new type of coronavirus has infected thousands of people in China. Nearly all of the cases outside China are among people who recently traveled from there. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."

Malaysia imposes ban on Chinese tourists from Wuhan - Times of India,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia banned visitors from the Chinese city of Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province on Monday, in a bid to contain the spread of a deadly virus. A statement by the prime minister's office said the authorities will temporarily halt all issuance of visas for Chinese citizens from the area with immediate effect. ""The government has decided to suspend temporarily all immigration facilities ... to all China nationals from Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province,"" it said. Malaysia has reported four confirmed cases of the flu-like virus which started in the central-Chinese city and has spread worldwide. All four, including two children, are in stable condition. They are tourists from Wuhan who entered Malaysia for a holiday via neighbouring Singapore. The virus, similar to the SARS pathogen, has claimed at least 81 lives -- all of them in China. Malaysia welcomed 2.94 million visitors from China last year and is aiming to raise this to 3.48 million this year. The prime minister's office said the ban will be lifted when the situation returns to normal. Meanwhile, a campaign by Malaysians on petition website change.org urging the government to bar Chinese nationals from entering the country has gathered more than 383,000 signatures of the 500,000 target as of Monday evening. ""The government should think more of the health of Malaysians,"" the petition said.

"In Coronavirus, a ‘battle' that could humble China's strongman - Times of India","BEIJING: It took thousands of infections and scores of deaths from a mysterious virus for China's authoritarian leader to publicly say what had become glaringly obvious to many in recent weeks: The country is facing a grave public health crisis. After his declaration, the leader, Xi Jinping, put China on a virtual war footing to cope with the unfolding epidemic of the coronavirus. He convened an extraordinary session of the Communist Party's top political body, issuing orders for handling the crisis with the crisp, somber stoicism of a field marshal. ""We're sure to be able to win in this battle,"" he proclaimed on Saturday before his six grim-faced colleagues on the party's Politburo Standing Committee. Compared to the very low bar set by the Chinese leadership's secrecy and inaction during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, Xi has responded with speed and alacrity to the latest health emergency, a pneumonialike virus that at last official count has killed at least 80, sickened thousands in China and spread around the world. But there are also signs that the government, especially at the regional level in Hubei province, the source of the outbreak, was slow to recognize the danger and is continuing to mishandle the crisis. Some public health experts have asked whether the sweeping travel restrictions that have been imposed are leaving people without access to medical care, while many Chinese remain unconvinced the government is being completely forthcoming about the toll of the disease. ""Substantively, the response this time is more or less the same,"" said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. ""Local officials downplayed the outbreak at the initial, but crucial, stage of the outbreak. The media was muzzled. The public was kept in the dark. As a result, valuable time was lost."" The turnaround from complacency to nationwide mobilization typifies how China can respond to an unexpected crisis like a lumbering giant, reluctant to stir, but then capable of shattering urgency. It represents both sides of the authoritarian political bargain under Xi. A fear of upsetting the party's protocols and leaders' desire for unruffled stability can deter even officials who want to do well by the public. Conversely, the government can operate with brutal efficiency when it wants. It was only after a brief written statement under Xi's name on January 20, when he was touring a military base and shopping exposition in Yunnan province, that the vast Chinese state bureaucracy began to shudder into action. Officials then quickly acknowledged the dangers of the coronavirus and ordered drastic measures to stop the spread — perhaps, experts said, belatedly — including the lockdown of much of the province where the epidemic emerged, penning in 56 million people. The government also ordered the construction of two hospitals in Wuhan to deal exclusively with patients afflicted with the coronavirus, which are expected to open within days, not months or years. ""The thing about China is that they can mobilize agencies and resources faster than anybody else can,"" said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and author of ""Xi Jinping: The Backlash."" ""The other side is that they can conceal things."" ""In China there is no independent entity that can get on the front foot and disseminate information,"" he added. From a localized medical mystery a few weeks ago, the coronavirus has erupted as one of the most complex and unpredictable tests for Xi since he came to power more than seven years ago. Over that time, he has by some measures established himself as the most formidable Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. The epidemic and the effectiveness of the government's response remain subject to many unknowns, but the outbreak comes at a time when Xi has already been facing quiet whispers about his political acumen. In the past year, he has experienced repeated setbacks on some of the most vital issues on his agenda. Protests against China's tightening grip continue to convulse Hong Kong. Rancor with Washington was only partly eased by a trade deal that some said required China to promise too many concessions. Two weeks ago, voters in Taiwan, the island democracy that Xi has made clear should join a greater China, resoundingly reelected a president despised by Beijing. Xi's sheer dominance, according to several experts and political insiders, may be contributing to his problems by hampering internal debate that could help avoid misjudgments. Beijing, for example, has underestimated the staying power of the protesters in Hong Kong and the public support behind them. ""It's a paradox,"" said Rong Jian, an independent scholar of Chinese politics in Beijing. ""It's precisely because Xi is so powerful that policy problems often arise — nobody dares disagree, and problems are spotted too late."" While state and local officials have been criticized, the public health system has been credited with responding effectively, particularly compared with the response to the SARS crisis. In that case, officials covered up the extent of the viral outbreak for months, almost certainly abetting its spread and exacerbating the death toll, which reached nearly 800. This time, even as officials in Wuhan said nothing publicly, government scientists shared information with the World Health Organization on the last day of 2019, isolated the virus and posted details about it on an international database 10 days later. That allowed experts from around the world to quickly conclude that the new coronavirus, like the one from SARS, had very likely originated in bats and made the leap to humans through infection of another mammal in a market in Wuhan. The Lancet, one of the leading medical journals, praised China's handling of the outbreak so far in an editorial. ""The lessons from the SARS epidemic — where China was insufficiently prepared to implement infection control practices — have been successfully learned,"" it wrote. ""By most accounts, Chinese authorities are meeting international standards and isolating suspected cases and contacts, developing diagnostic and treatment procedures, and implementing public education campaigns."" The journal went on to emphasize that the ultimate success of the response would ""depend on maintaining trust between the authorities and the local population."" Xi's government, despite its call to arms, may have already undercut that trust. On the local level in Wuhan, people have vented anger and frustration, which is percolating on social media despite censorship. In widely circulated, and then censored, comments, a senior journalist with The Hubei Daily, the province's main party newspaper, called for a change of leadership in Wuhan. ""With this extraordinarily grim situation worsening and expanding by the day, those currently in office lack that commanding leadership,"" the journalist, Zhang Ouya, wrote on Sina.com Weibo, a popular Chinese social media service. There is evidence, too, that local authorities kept a lid on the crisis in the first days of January so as not to upset the cheerful tone for a provincial legislative session that is a highlight of the local political cycle. ""This year will be a major landmark year,"" Wang Xiaodong, the provincial governor, told the legislative members. ""Let us unite even more closely around the party central leadership with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core."" Wang is now widely accused of underplaying the virus threat. ""China is a much more decentralized place than it appears,"" said David Cowhig, a former American diplomat who served 10 years in China and monitored health and science issues. ""Local officials have great discretion; China is a coalition of ‘little' Big Brothers,"" he said. ""Xi realizes this and is trying to re-centralize China."" Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies China, said that the centralization of power since the SARS crisis did not appear to have strengthened expertise at the local level or the willingness of underequipped regional hospitals to report. ""I think the central health authorities are trying to be more transparent,"" he said, ""but the local government remains loath to share disease related information in a timely and accurate manner."" Not all the blame can fall on the officials in Wuhan. The central authorities still control the political and propaganda apparatus, which has sought to minimize the severity of the crisis. Before the standing committee's meeting on Saturday, Xi and other senior officials went about their business as if there were no crisis, appearing at a banquet on Thursday in the Great Hall of the People to celebrate the Lunar New Year. When he did speak, Xi emphasized the need for preserving public stability. The phrase alludes to the fear of popular unrest boiling over, which is, as ever, the party state's highest priority. It could become a reality if the epidemic, as predicted, inflicts sustained hardship on the economy and people's livelihood. ""The truth is in a public-health emergency; it's not just the medical professionals who matter,"" McGregor said. ""It's the management of it in the government and in the public that matters, too. It's hard to argue that they've done that well."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
Coronavirus alert: Health department starts screening fliers | Bhubaneswar News - Times of India,"BHUBANESWAR/JHARSUGUDA: The state government on Sunday started screening of passengers from Kuala Lumpur in view of Malaysia confirming some cases of coronavirus (2019 n-CoV) there. Odisha has, however, not found a single suspected case of corona that has killed more than 80 in China. After taking stock of the situation here, health secretary Nikunja Bihari Dhal on Monday said, “Our vulnerability is because of the direct flight from Malaysia, which has confirmed three n-CoV cases. A health team is stationed at the airport to check people flying from there. No suspected cases have been reported so far.” Bhubaneswar has only one direct international flight (AirAsia) connecting the city with Kuala Lumpur four days a week. Dhal said there is no cause of panic. Only alertness is needed. “Those having recent travel history to affected countries and developing symptoms of acute fever, running nose, cough sore throat and shortness of breath should report to the health unit stationed at the airport,” he said. Dhal said the state has also requested the Union health ministry to ensure facility for thermal screening of passengers, in which a thermal imager measures temperature from radiation from people screened. The Centre has already made such facility available in seven airports having flights to China and Hong Kong. The government also asked the hotels to ensure international travellers, particularly those who have travelled to affected countries in past one month,, make self-declaration about their health condition. Ajit Kumar Mohanty, director public health, said the suspected cases, if any, will be clinically examined in the isolation room in the airport and the persons would be shifted to the Capital Hospital. V V Rao, director, Biju Patnaik International Airport, said, “Commuters coming from Malaysia or with travel history to China are making a self-declaration about their clinical condition. Anyone having suspected symptoms is supposed to report the same to immigration authorities, who in turn will alert the health authorities.” The Capital Hospital besides AIIMS Bhubaneswar, SCB Medical College and Hospital Cuttack, VSS Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Burla and District Headquarters Hospital, Jharsuguda, have readied isolation wards for possible cases. Saroj Samal, district collector (Jharsuguda), after reviewing the preparedness there, said, “Screening of suspected passengers will be done at Jharsuguda airport from Tuesday. “We have also asked Vedanta Ltd Jharsuguda (aluminum company) for information regarding any official, who are from China or visiting China relating to any business. We will screen them as well,” he said. The Paradip port set up a special Coronavirus help desk and started thermal screening for crew members for ships Chief medical officer (CMO), Paradip Port Hospital , Prahallad Panda said temperature is being screened for all crew members of the ships coming from other countries after their arrival in the port. “We have set up an isolation ward in the hospital at Paradip to treat any suspected patient. Crew members, who exhibit the symptoms, will be sent to the hospital for further testing,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Coronavirus outbreak: China death toll spikes to 80, over 2,700 cases confirmed - Times of India","WUHAN: China said on Monday that the death toll from a deadly viral outbreak spiked to 80 as the hard-hit epicentre province of Hubei suffered 24 new fatalities, while total confirmed cases nationwide rose sharply to 2,744. While there were no new deaths confirmed outside of Hubei, the national tally of verified infections rose by 769, around half of them in Hubei, the National Health Commission said. It said 461 of those infected were in serious condition. China has locked down Hubei in the country's centre, an unprecedented operation affecting tens of millions of people and intended to slow transmission of the respiratory virus. The previously unknown contagion has caused global concern because of its similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pathogen, which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Drastic travel restrictions have been imposed outside the epicentre, with Shandong province and four cities -- Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and Tianjin - announcing bans on long-distance buses entering or leaving. Coronavirus outbreak: Americans may get to leave Wuhan, hope rises for IndiansThe move will affect millions of people travelling over the Lunar New Year holiday, which authorities said would be extended while the government works to contain the virus. The populous southern province of Guangdong, Jiangxi in central China, and three cities made it mandatory for residents to wear face masks in public. Originating in Hubei's capital of Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and across the world - with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries including as far away as the United States.

"Coronavirus in China: China extends holiday, businesses shut as virus toll rises | International Business News - Times of India","SHANGHAI: The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak in China rose to 81 on Monday, as the government extended the Lunar New Year holiday and more big businesses shut down or told staff to work from home in an effort to curb the spread. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited the central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, as the government sought to signal it was responding seriously to the crisis. The total number of confirmed cases in China rose about 30% to 2,744, about half of them in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. As worries grew around the world, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has had eight confirmed cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days. The ban did not cover Hong Kong residents. The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei climbed to 76 from 56, health officials said, with five deaths elsewhere in China, including the southern island province of Hainan, which reported its first fatality on Monday. While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, linked to people who traveled from Wuhan, no deaths have been reported elsewhere. Li is the most senior leader to visit Wuhan since the outbreak began. Clad in a blue protective suit and mask, he inspected efforts to contain the epidemic and spoke to patients and medical staff, the government said. The government is extending the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to February 2, in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. The Lunar New Year is usually a time for millions of people to travel, but many have had to cancel their plans because of travel curbs over the virus. IncubationWuhan is already in virtual lockdown and severe limits on movement are in place in several other Chinese cities. The city of 11 million clamped down further on Monday, announcing the suspension of visa and passport services until January 30. Despite the curbs, the mayor of Wuhan said on Sunday that five million people had left the city for holidays and other reasons. Images from Wuhan showing hospital corridors packed with people seeking treatment have circulated on social media, along with complaints of soaring prices for essentials such as vegetables. Chinese leaders have urged transparency in the crisis, after public trust was eroded by the cover-up of the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. Much is not known about the newly identified coronavirus, including how easily it spreads and just how dangerous it is. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. National Health Commission minister Ma Xiaowei said on Sunday the incubation period could range from one to 14 days, and the virus was infectious during incubation, unlike SARS. That compares with a World Health Organization (WHO) estimate of two to 10 days for the incubation period. “Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the virus to others is critical for control efforts,” the WHO said. The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a Wuhan market illegally selling wildlife. It has spread to other cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as more than 10 countries including France, Japan and the United States. ‘Overwhelmed’Australia confirmed its fifth case on Monday involving a woman on the last flight out of Wuhan to Sydney before China’s travel ban. Health minister Greg Hunt told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) authorities aimed to get about 100 Australian children and young people out of Wuhan. One father of two, Nathan Wang, told the ABC his wife was stuck in Wuhan with the children. “We absolutely want the children to come back, because hospitals in Wuhan are overwhelmed,” he said. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health experts have questioned its effectiveness. Last week the WHO stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is due to travel to Beijing to meet officials and health experts. Australia, France, Italy, Japan and the United States have all said they are working to evacuate citizens from Wuhan. Some of China’s biggest companies have been affected, with hotpot restaurant chain Haidilao International Holding shutting branches nationwide from Sunday until Friday. Gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd advised staff to work from home until February 7, and e-commerce firm Alibaba removed vendors’ offers of overpriced face masks from its online Taobao marketplace as prices surged.

China Virus: China extends holiday to buy time as virus keeps spreading | World News - Times of India,"WUHAN: China on Monday extended its biggest national holiday to buy time in the fight against a viral epidemic, as the death toll spiked to 80 despite unprecedented quarantine measures and travel lock downs. In a sign of the mounting official concern, Premier Li Keqiang visited the ground-zero province of Hubei to oversee containment efforts in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the virus emerged late last year. The government has sealed off Wuhan and neighbouring cities, effectively trapping tens of millions of people, in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. Thousands of foreigners have also been ensnared in the lockdowns, triggering a scramble from some countries to orchestrate evacuation flights from Wuhan for their citizens. 'Coronavirus harder to contain than SARS': All you need to knowTwenty-four new deaths were confirmed in Hubei on Monday, bringing the overall death toll to 80, while confirmed infections swelled to more than 2,700 nationwide. A nine-month-old baby was among those infected, authorities said, making her the youngest person to have been confirmed to have contracted the virus. And thousands more patients with flu-like symptoms were suspected to have the virus. Authorities around the country have also imposed aggressive curbs on transport during the usually high-traffic Lunar New Year holiday season now underway, in a race to cut off transmission routes. Typically hundreds of millions people criss-cross China in jam-packed buses and trains during the Lunar New Year holiday, a time for family reunions. However those festivities have been ruined this year by the efforts to contain the virus, which can be transmitted between humans like a common flu. The central government said Monday it would extend the national holiday, initially due to end on January 30, for three days to limit population flows. Authorities have also closed down popular public gathering spots, including parts of the Great Wall and tourism hotspots such as Shanghai Disneyland. With the virus having spread to around a dozen countries, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus headed to Beijing to meet with government officials on the crisis. ""My WHO colleagues and I would like to understand the latest developments and strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak,"" he said on Twitter. The WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak an international public health emergency, which would have prompted more concerted international action including possible trade or travel restrictions. Cases have been reported as far afield as France, the United States and Canada, with various countries in Asia also detecting cases. Those infected had previously been in China. The United States, France and Japan were among the countries looking to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan on Monday. Embassy in Beijing constantly checking on health, well-being of Indians: JaishankarHowever, days after plans for the emergency flights were initially floated, none had yet taken off. Most foreign governments had not announced evacuation plans, and their trapped citizens were growing increasingly fearful. ""I'm getting more concerned everyday,"" Do Quang Duy, 32, a Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP. ""When I look at the phone, I see dozens of reports and announcements of rising numbers of infected people, as well as deaths. I am very worried."" All of the fatalities so far have been in China, with most of those in Hubei. The government says the deaths have largely been elderly or people already weakened by pre-existing health conditions. China's National Health Commission said on Monday that there were 2,744 confirmed infections nationwide, an increase of 769 from the previous day. In addition, the number of suspected cases also doubled over 24 hours to nearly 6,000. Wuhan's mayor Zhou Xianwang, speaking at a press conference while wearing a mask, said on Sunday that around five million people had left the city for the Lunar New Year travel rush in January, further heightening fears about the contagion's spread. The virus is suspected of having come from animals in a market that sold a wide range of exotic wild game. On Sunday, the government said it was banning all trade in wildlife until the emergency is over, but conservationists called for Beijing to make the ban permanent to reduce the possibility of future outbreaks. It has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

Proposed Hong Kong virus quarantine building firebombed during protest - Times of India,"HONG KONG: Protesters threw petrol bombs on Sunday night at an empty public housing complex in Hong Kong that had been earmarked to become a temporary quarantine zone as the city battles an outbreak of the SARS-like Novel Coronavirus. Hong Kong has declared the virus that first began in central China as a public ""emergency"" -- the city's highest warning tier -- and on Saturday announced ramped-up measures to reduce the risk of further infections. Among them was a plan to turn a newly built but currently empty public housing block in Fanling into a quarantine facility. The buildings would be used to house people who may have come into contact with carriers of the virus as they wait to get tested, as well as frontline medical staff worried about infecting their families. The city has diagnosed six positive cases of the virus so far. Dozens of local residents and protesters opposed to the idea held rallies outside the complex on Sunday, with some setting up road blocks. In the evening, police said assailants threw petrol bombs at the buildings. An AFP photographer on the scene saw fierce flames coming from the entrance of two apartment blocks before firefighters got the blaze under control. Riot police were on scene and protesters had left, although some local residents were arguing with officers who used pepper spray. The Centre for Health Protection said the plan to turn the housing estate into a quarantine zone would be suspended. The agency has already turned a holiday park in an isolated rural area into a working quarantine facility. Two other holiday parks located away from major housing estates are also ready to be used as similar facilities. But officials say they have struggled to find hotels and spare rooms for doctors and nurses working on the isolation wards where patients are being treated. The virus outbreak comes at a time when Hong Kong is already boiling with widespread anti-government sentiment after seven months of often violent pro-democracy protests. The city's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam boasts record-low approval ratings while the police force is loathed in many neighbourhoods. The frequency and ferocity of protests have died down in the last six weeks, but sporadic clashes still take place. Police fired tear gas on Saturday night -- the first day of the Lunar New Year -- at small groups of masked protesters in Mongkok. Nearly 300 people were killed by SARS in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. The city's ability to combat the crisis was hampered by moves in mainland China to cover up and play down the outbreak, leaving a lasting legacy of distrust among many Hong Kongers. Animosity towards China has intensified in recent years as Beijing tightens political control over the semi-autonomous territory and as mainlanders compete with locals for jobs, property and goods in the pricey city.

China exempts US imports from tariffs for virus fight - Times of India,"BEIJING: Beijing announced Saturday that US imports that can be used in China's fight against a deadly new virus will be exempted from retaliatory tariffs imposed in the trade war. The decision comes as China is scrambling to contain the spread of the virus which has overwhelmed hospitals and caused shortages of medical supplies in the worst affected city, Wuhan. The US and China have been engaged in a bruising trade conflict for around two years, although both sides came to a ceasefire last month with Beijing agreeing to buy a further $200 billion of US products in a partial trade deal. But tit-for-tat levies remain on goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars. On Saturday, China announced that it would ""implement more preferential import tariff measures from January to March 2020, to step up support for prevention and control of the (ongoing) epidemic"". Authorities added that ""tariffs that have been levied (on goods used in the fight against the virus) can be refunded."" Beijing said it would relax its rules on tariff exemptions, and this would extend to goods such as disinfectants, protective supplies and emergency command vehicles.

China imposes first partial lockdown in city outside virus epicentre - Times of India,"BEIJING: China announced a partial lockdown in the southern city of Shantou on Sunday in a bid to control the spread of a deadly virus, the first such measure taken outside the epicentre of the disease. From midnight, non-emergency vehicles will be prohibited from entering the city of 5.6 million people, which is a 1,100-kilometre (680-mile) drive from Wuhan, the heart of the epidemic. People arriving at Shantou train stations will be screened and ""urged to return"", said city authorities. Buses, ferries, public transport and taxis will be suspended, Shantou authorities said on their official social media account. The measures are to ""spare no efforts in doing a good job of preventing and controlling"" the epidemic, Shantou officials said, and to ""cut off the channels of spreading the virus"". The new virus has infected nearly 2,000 across China and killed 56. Most of the dead are in Wuhan or the surrounding Hubei province. There have been two cases confirmed in Shantou and 98 in Guangdong province, according to the province's health commission. In Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei province, authorities have banned people from leaving the city of 11 million people. Transport bans have been placed in many other cities in Hubei, affecting some 56 million people. Shantou's statement did not announce restrictions on residents leaving the city, and said that the main highway could be used normally.

Coronavirus: French carmaker to evacuate expats from virus-hit Chinese city - Times of India,"PARIS: French carmaker PSA on Saturday said it would repatriate expat staff from Wuhan as fears grew that more cases of coronavirus would be found in France. Three cases of the virus have been confirmed in France while Chinese authorities have said the death toll there has risen to 41 with around 1,300 infected. The French firm, which makes brands including Peugeot and Citroen, said in a statement the evacuation was being ""implemented in full cooperation with the Chinese authorities and French consulate general"" and involved 38 people made up of staff members and their families working in the Wuhan region. They would be quarantined in the city of Changsha, around 300 kilometres (180 miles) from Wuhan where the virus originated, before being allowed to return ""to their countries of origin"", the company said in a statement. The first cases to be confirmed in Europe were announced by French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn on Friday. Others were ""being monitored"", said Paris emergency service chief Pierre Cali, without giving an exact figure. ""We are going to have patients suspected of having the virus, there are going to be (more) cases,"" warned Yazdan Yazdanpanah, head of infectious diseases at Paris's Bichat hospital where two of the three cases were being treated.

The other case involved a 48-year-old man, originally from China, who returned to France on January 22 after having ""passed through Wuhan"", according to Buzyn. He has been in hospital in the southwestern French city since Thursday after contacting doctors with a high temperature and a cough. ""Ten to 15 people"" who had been in contact with him had come forward, Bordeaux mayor Nicolas Florian said, adding that Chinese New Year festivities planned for Sunday had been cancelled by organisers ""as a precaution"". An in-depth investigation into the three cases was launched which identified all those who had had close contact with the three patients to ensure that they were properly monitored to prevent the spread of the virus, French health ministry officials said. All three were currently ""very well"", France's director-general of health Jerome Solomon said. ""We are all reassured by their progress,"" he added. A medical team several dozen strong would be put in place at Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport from Sunday, health authorities added on Saturday. The new virus has now infected people across China and in nearly a dozen other countries. China's most important celebration, the New Year festivities, has been all but cancelled for at least 56 million people as authorities expanded travel bans. The world's most populous country has scrambled to try to contain the disease, building a second field hospital in Wuhan to relieve overwhelmed medical facilities and closing more travel routes as the country marked the Lunar New Year holiday. A seafood and live animal market in Wuhan has been identified as the centre of the outbreak. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
"For one Chinese family in New York, it was simply time to go home, virus or not - Times of India","NEW YORK: Jonathan Niu got to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport five hours early on Friday, not least because he had a lot of luggage to check for his flight to his native China: He was hauling back boxes filled with hundreds of face masks. His mother and father, both in their 70s, came to visit him in New York about five months ago, their first trip there in 20 years. In the interim, a new coronavirus has emerged in China and become a fast-spreading global health crisis, prompting foreign governments to fly their citizens out of the country. Niu was among those who were traveling against the tide along with his parents, who missed their home after months away. ""Now it's time to go back,"" said Niu, 44, who moved to the United States more than 20 years ago and lives in Manhattan, where he works in finance. The family remembers past virus outbreaks, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and survived them, he said. He thought the US State Department was wise to warn Americans against nonessential travel to China because of the epidemic, which has infected nearly 10,000 people. But he wanted to shepherd his parents home. Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc joined other airlines on Friday in suspending all remaining US-China flights. Even so, Niu's father seemed relaxed ahead of his flight on China Eastern Airlines from Terminal 1. He smiled broadly, urging a reporter to immediately book a flight to China as well. His mother had been less sure. ""She was so nervous, she couldn't get any sleep,"" Niu said. After arriving, Niu said he planned to make sure his parents' home in Hefei, capital of the eastern province of Anhui, was well stocked with groceries and other supplies. He would then settle in and stay with them for a month or two in a sort of self-imposed quarantine before returning to New York. ""It's like a zombie movie,"" Niu said, although he imagined he might venture outside to a nearby store if he really needed to. ""I've downloaded a lot of movies on my iPad."" Niu figured he would cheer up his parents' neighbors by sharing some of his supply of face masks and drop off some at a nearby hospital. ""Everybody’s panicking there,"" he said. ""People can't get the masks."" The stash cost him about $400. He had also packed five or so masks in his carry-on luggage, thinking he would hand them to his seatmates on the plane. 'We need to stay home'Almost everyone waiting on line to check in to flights to Shanghai and Beijing at Terminal 1 on Friday were Chinese citizens returning home after a US vacation or work trip. Linda Xu, 40, had visited New York with her young son and daughter and her husband, and was bracing to be mostly confined with them indoors in their home in Beijing. ""We need to stay home,"" she said, her voice muffled by a mask. ""No school,"" said Shawn Xu, her 11-year-old son, seeming pleased. Two Americans in the line declined to answer questions about their trip. Four other Americans said they were connecting in Shanghai to other flights to Thailand or the Philippines and had no plans to leave the airport in China. All the airline staff at check-in desks wore face masks, as did about half of the passengers waiting in line. An employee for China Eastern Airlines at one of the desks said the masks had become mandatory for staff members in the last couple of days. After most passengers had checked in, two China Eastern flight attendants stood waiting on the terminal floor, their faces mostly hidden by masks. Another employee soon dashed over, bearing three boxes filled with another 150 face masks, which the attendants dropped in a plastic bag before turning to head toward the plane.

China faces more border curbs as virus death toll rises - Times of India,"SHANGHAI: The number of deaths from a coronavirus epidemic in China has risen by 46 to 259, the country's health authority said on Saturday, as the United States and other nations announced new border curbs on foreigners who have been in China. The central province of Hubei, the centre of the epidemic, is under a virtual quarantine, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down. Elsewhere in China, authorities have placed restrictions on travel and business activity. In its latest figures, China's National Health Commission said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China on Friday, bringing the cumulative total to 11,791. Around two dozen other countries have reported another 137 cases. The Chinese data would suggest it is less deadly than the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people of the some 8,000 it infected, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. In Beijing, counters were set up at the entrances of housing estates, where volunteers wearing red arm bands and masks noted down details of residents coming back from their hometowns after the Lunar New Year holiday. ""As long as I am properly protected and don't go to crowded places, I don’t feel scared at all about my hometown or Beijing,” said a 58-year-old migrant worker surnamed Sun. Others were more worried. ""There will be a huge number of people returning to the city, I think it will put Beijing at risk of more infections,"" said Zhang Chunlei, 45, another returning migrant worker. The World Health Organization, which this week declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, has said global trade and travel restrictions were not needed. But Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to ban foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering their territories. EvacuationsAustralia followed suit, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying the country will deny entry to all foreign nationals travelling from mainland China from Saturday. ""We're in fact operating with an abundance of caution in these circumstances,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney. ""So Australians can go about their daily lives with confidence."" Qantas Airways Ltd and Air New Zealand said travel bans forced them to suspend their direct flights to China from Feb. 9. All three major US airlines said on Friday they would cancel flights to mainland China. Nearly 10,000 flights have been suspended since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, according to travel and data analytics firm Cirium, illustrating concerns about a slowdown in economic activity in China and elsewhere. Many nations have put on charter flights to repatriate citizens from China and then place in isolation for around two weeks, the incubation period of the virus. More than 300 South Koreans arrived home on Saturday and Indonesian officials said around 250 nationals were being evacuated from Hubei. Britain said it was withdrawing some staff from its embassy and consulates in China. ""In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide assistance to British nationals from within China may be limited,"" the UK government said in a statement. Many of the costly private clinics catering to foreigners in China have started to turn people with fevers away, raising concerns among expats that they would have to rely on crowded local facilities. ""I don't want to go to the local hospital with a sore throat only to catch something else,"" said Czech national Veronika Krubner in Tianjin, who is considering leaving the country with her 21-month-old daughter. DisruptionsInfections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan, raising concerns that new hot spots are emerging despite strict travel restrictions. In one of them, Huanggang, authorities asked households to designate one individual who can leave the home, a local newspaper said. The city has a population of about 7.5 million. The northern city of Tianjin, home to some 15 million, suspended all schools and businesses until further notice. Although the WHO has praised China's efforts to contain the virus, the US-based China Human Rights Defenders urged Beijing to ease restrictions on movement and counter discrimination against residents of Wuhan and Hubei. ""Human rights must not be a casualty of the government’s work to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 200 people and affected millions,"" the group said. Still, efforts to contain the virus have caused disruptions and risk exacerbating a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy. Growth had already slowed in the fourth-quarter to a 30-year low of 6%. The virus impact prompted Capital Economics to almost halve its estimate for first-quarter growth to 3% from 5.7%. China's central bank said the impact was temporary and economic fundamentals remained sound, but it would increase monetary and credit support, including lowering lending costs for affected companies. Apple Inc said on Saturday it would close all of its official stores and corporate offices in China until Feb. 9, the latest of dozens of major companies, including Sweden's IKEA and Walmart Inc, restricting travel and operations due to the outbreak.

Any disease spread can be checked: Madurai doctors | Madurai News - Times of India,"MADURAI: Even as a deadly new strain of coronavirus continues to spread havoc across the world, doctors in Madurai have exuded confidence that the spread of any illness can be prevented, as was done in the case of swine flu. However, they admit that at the moment not much is known about the new virus in terms of its origin, spread, diagnosis, risk population and treatment. Chinese authorities had identified the coronavirus as a family of viruses that causes illnesses including the common cold, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). On Wednesday, a symposium on coronavirus was held at Government Rajaji Hospital here. “As researches show, many viruses which were so far dormant in animals have the ability to suddenly mutate and spread illness to human beings. Such instances are increasing which is of concern as it takes time to figure out and treat a new illness,” said Dr Prabhakaran, HOD of thoracic medicine at GRH.

"Coronavirus: 10-bed facility ready at GH; airlines, airport step up safety measures | Chennai News - Times of India","Chennai: As coronavirus infection continues to spread in China and cases surface in Southeast Asia and the Far East, the state government has laid out a protocol to manage patients detected with the novel strain. All passengers arriving at airports in Tamil Nadu from China and Hong Kong are being screened using thermal detectors to watch out for influenza-like symptoms in order to pick possible cases of new coronavirus identified in China. Airlines which fly to destinations where cases have been detected have told their crew to look out for passengers with symptoms of fever and report them to the authorities. If there are patients who are suspected and tested positive, they will be taken to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in the city. The hospital has 10 isolation beds and it can be increased to any number in multiple hospitals if necessary, said Dr K Kolandaisamy, director of public health. A multidisciplinary team comprising a public health expert, clinician and microbiologist will reach Chennai to review end-to-end preparedness for management and control of the virus - thermal screening and transferring of patients to hospitals for isolation. It will also visit tertiary hospitals attached to airports for reviewing the isolation wards and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks etc. The team will review whether infection control, surveillance and other guidelines are being followed and will coordinate with the government to support and strengthen preparedness, said a statement from the Union government. Though airports at Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok are screening passengers, airlines are also taking steps to ensure that passengers and crew are safe. Flights from the infected destinations are being fumigated and crew has been told to watch for passengers who show signs of fever. Chennai has direct flight link to Hong Kong and Japan where cases of the virus have been detected. There are around seven flights on weekdays and nine flights on weekends between Chennai and Singapore. Singapore Airlines said, “A health advisory notice by Singapore’s Ministry of Health is being distributed to passengers. We have in place standard operating procedures to handle inflight medical emergencies, including potentially infectious diseases. Any unwell passenger will be attended to by the medical authorities immediately after the aircraft lands. As an added measure, inflight announcements regarding coronavirus will be made on all outbound and inbound flights to Singapore. Surgical masks will also be made available to our crew who operate to affected stations.” In a statement IndiGo airlines, which operates flights to Chengdu and Guangzhou in China, said, “Our crew are taking appropriate precautions. There have been no cases reported yet in our Chinese points, which are around 1,000 km from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, nor indeed in India. We are in close touch with the government authorities and will advise of any alterations to our schedule, as and when they occur. Meantime, we have many thousands of forward bookings and are serving those customers as normal.” An airline official said China has stopped all tours of its citizens headed abroad and Cathay Pacific’s subsidiary Cathay Dragon has suspended flights between Wuhan and Hong Kong. “This has come as a relief as it will cut chances of the infection spreading.” Earlier, health minister C Vijayabaskar said airports will continue routine thermal screening of arriving passengers. If patients arriving in Chennai from China show symptoms of flu, they will be taken to the government hospital for treatment. Warning signs for the new strain, like other influenza viruses, includes fever, cough and breathing difficulties, while more advanced cases could lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and death. We always reserve 10 beds in the hospital for quarantine. They will be taken there,” he said. The state has also sent available educational material on the virus to doctors’ bodies to ensure they identify cases early. Tests for the new virus will be sent to National Institute of Virology lab, officials said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Markets around the world are feeling the coronavirus chill - Times of India,"NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks around the world fell this week on worries that a new type of virus in China may ultimately hit profits for companies from Wuhan to Washington. The World Health Organization has held off on calling the outbreak a global health emergency but says it may become one. The virus has killed more than two dozen people and infected more than 800, with the epicenter in the city of Wuhan in central China. The virus can transmit from human to human, which increases its potential spread. WHY ARE INVESTORS WORRIED?Past outbreaks of disease have caused sharp losses for stocks, at least temporarily. Stocks in Hong Kong lost about 10% in March and April of 2003 when the number of new SARS cases confirmed was accelerating, for example. Besides the physical toll of illnesses and deaths, fear of disease can cause people to stop traveling, shopping and eating out at restaurants. Even if the disease stays mostly outside the United States, it can significantly impact profits for U.S. companies. China accounted for 6% of all revenue for S&P 500 companies over the last 12 months, nearly double any other country besides the United States, according to FactSet. “It can have broad impacts well beyond China,” Procter & Gamble CFO Jon Moeller told analysts on Thursday. WHAT U.S. STOCKS ARE GETTING HIT HARDEST?Companies that get lots of business directly from China, particularly in the travel industry. Both Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts get the majority of their revenue from casinos in Macao, which is on the southern coast of China. Each lost more than 8% this past week. Airlines have been hurt by worries that the outbreak will keep customers from flying not only to and from China but across the region. United Airlines dropped 8.7% this week. It has about 5.5% of its capacity allocated to U.S-China/Hong Kong routes, more than its big rivals, according to Stifel analysts. But the impact could be felt beyond China. Consider Hawaii. Chinese tourists are the highest-spending visitors to the state, shelling out $349 per person per day in 2018. If Chinese vacationers stay home, U.S. hoteliers are vulnerable even if they have no locations in Asia. European luxury companies as a group get about 35% of their sales from Chinese customers, including sales made in China and in Europe by visiting Chinese tourists, according to J.P. Morgan analysts. SO ONLY TRAVEL AND RETAIL-ORIENTED COMPANIES ARE AT RISK? No. Wuhan is also a big industrial center in China, with factories pumping out steel, smartphones and automobiles. That could raise costs for companies further down the supply chain. DO OTHER RECENT OUTBREAKS GIVE A ROADMAP OF WHAT TO EXPECT? The closest corollary to this new coronavirus may be severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2002-2003, which ultimately led to 774 deaths and infected nearly 8,100, according to the World Health Organization. More than 80% of the deaths were in China and Hong Kong. Both SARS and the latest outbreak began spreading during the month of December, ahead of the crush of travel scheduled for the Lunar New Year holiday, and travel-related stocks were among the first and hardest hit. In general, stock markets tend to bottom with the peak in new cases during an outbreak, before rebounding within months, according to J.P. Morgan strategists. Stocks in Hong Kong recovered all their SARS-related losses by the second half of 2003. The U.S. market was not as impacted and rose steadily for most of the year. DOES THIS OUTBREAK LOOK LIKE IT WILL FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATH?Experts are hopeful this outbreak may not be as severe because China is acting more quickly and forcefully. As for corporate profits, the shift to online shopping in China could help mitigate the effects of people staying away from stores. But the move to digital life also carries risks: Social media is much more popular than it was in 2002-2003, and panic can shoot quickly through social networks. Any sharp cutbacks in travel, though, will weigh on oil prices. China is the world’s biggest driver for growth in oil demand. Oil fell 2.5% Friday.ARE THERE ANY POTENTIAL WINNERS IN ALL THIS? Stocks of vaccine makers initially surged on speculation that their sales could get a boost. Analysts said Novavax, a company with a market value of $250 million, is exploring the development of a vaccine candidate for this new coronavirus. It jumped nearly 36% this week. Inovio Pharmaceuticals, which said it received a grant of up to $9 million to develop a vaccine against the new virus, was up nearly 29%. Those big moves may be overblown, though. Raymond James analyst Chris Meekins said in a report that he doesn’t expect any U.S. government funding to address the issue anytime soon, which is what could really move the stocks. When markets have tumbled in the past on pandemic worries, telecoms and other stocks known for having low volatility have tended to hold up better than the overall market.This story has not been edited by The Times of India and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News.(This story has not been edited by timesofindia.com and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.)"
Coronavirus: India 'requests' China to permit Indian students stuck in Wuhan to leave - Times of India,"BEIJING: As the coronavirus turned virulent, India is understood to have requested China to permit over 250 Indian students stuck in Wuhan, the epicentre of the new SARS-like virus, to leave the city, sources here said on Saturday. About 700 Indian students, mostly medical students, are believed to be studying in different universities in Wuhan and its surrounding areas. Authorities have prevented anyone from leaving Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the heart of the viral outbreak which has so far infected nearly 1,300 people and killed 41 others. While majority of the Indian students left for home on Chinese New Year holidays, over 250 to 300 students are said to be still in the city and its surrounding areas. Besides the students, the fast spreading virus has become a major worry for their parents back home. Some students managed to leave the city just before it was sealed off on January 23. India has stepped up monitoring of passengers arriving from China, especially from Wuhan. The sources here said that in view of the prevailing situation, India has requested both the Chinese foreign ministry and the local officials in Wuhan to consider making arrangements for the Indian students to leave. Asked whether China would consider any request of countries to move their citizens out of Wuhan, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told media here on Thursday that, “We always help foreign consular officials in China in their official jobs, we offer them all the assistance and convenience necessary and we work to guarantee foreign citizens legitimate rights and interest in China”. While specific detailed would be provided by local officials, he said China in principle always handles issues according to domestic laws, international laws and bilateral consular agreements. Authorities have extended transport bans to 17 other cities around Wuhan in an effort to control the SARS-like virus, restricting travel for around 56 million in Hubei province. On Saturday, the city officials have also banned all private transport in the city as part of stepped up measures to ensure little movement in the city. While India has earlier issued travel advisories to Indians travelling to China in view the coronavirus, the Indian Embassy here in the last few days has set up hotlines for the students in Wuhan to extend assistance and has talked to local officials about proper supply of food and other necessities for them.

"China coronavirus death toll rises to 56, total cases near 2,000 - Times of India","WUHAN: The death toll from a virus in China has risen to 56 and the number of people infected across the country is nearing 2,000, authorities said Sunday. Fifteen more people have died and at least 688 new cases of the coronavirus have now been confirmed, according to the National Health Commission. Among the new deaths, 13 were in Hubei, the province at the heart of the outbreak, while Shanghai reported its first death. At least 52 people have now died in total in Hubei, two in central Henan province, one in Heilongjiang in the northeast and one in Hebei in the north. Hubei's health authorities separately reported 323 new confirmed cases of the virus, which first emerged in the provincial capital, Wuhan, in late December. Chinese authorities have so far reported 1,975 cases nationwide. President Xi Jinping warned Saturday that China faced a ""grave situation"" as authorities raced to contain a respiratory illness that has caused the widespread abandonment of Lunar New Year celebrations nationwide and overwhelmed health facilities in Hubei. The contagion remained centred on the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, which accounted for seven of the new deaths and 46 of the new confirmed cases, said the Hubei Health Commission. Wuhan and more than a dozen other cities in the province have been locked down in a rapidly expanding quarantine effort marked by transport shutdowns and other restrictions on movement. The previously unknown virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pathogen, which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. It also has struck at possibly the worst time for China, when hundreds of millions of people are travelling across the country or overseas to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday, China's most important festival. Hundreds of military doctors have been sent to Hubei and authorities are rushing to build a pair of field hospitals to deal with the crisis as patients swamp local medical facilities. The virus has spread nationwide in China and cases have been reported in several other countries as far away as the United States, France and Australia.

Russia to evacuate citizens from China as virus toll rises - Times of India,"SHANGHAI: China faced mounting isolation from international travel curbs and flight suspensions on Saturday, with Russia to start pulling out its citizens next week, as the death toll from a spreading coronavirus outbreak rose to 259. The epidemic has led to mass evacuations of foreign citizens as world airlines halt flights, and risks exacerbating a slowdown in growth in the world's second-largest economy. The Russian military was to start evacuating Russian citizens from China on Monday and Tuesday, Interfax and TASS news agencies reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying the evacuations would be from regions that had been most affected by the outbreak. Peskov first said that evacuation will start on Saturday but later corrected himself. Russia has already reported its first two cases of coronavirus and restricted direct flights to China. China's National Health Commission said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China as of Friday, bringing the total to 11,791. Around two dozen other countries have reported another 137 cases. The death toll rose by 46 to 259, all in China. The Chinese data would suggest it is less deadly than the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people of the some 8,000 it infected, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.

"Cotton, castor prices fall as virus clouds export prospects | Ahmedabad News - Times of India","Ahmedabad: Prices of cotton and castor seed have eased in local markets, as the novel coronavirus outbreak in China has clouded export prospects. While China is a major buyer, Gujarat is a leading supplier of these commodities. Castor prices have declined to Rs 4,050 a quintal from Rs 4,180 a fortnight ago. Prices in tghe futures market are even lower, due to the uncertainty, market players say. China imports 2 lakh tonnes of castor oil worth Rs 2,500 crore every year, which is 40% of India’s castor oil exports. “There is no impact on exports currently. However, business sentiment has been dampened due to the coronavirus outbreak. If this situation persists and derivative product makers in China are compelled to shut factories, it will certainly reduce our exports,” said B V Mehta, executive director, the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA). According to Arun Dalal, a cotton broker from Ahmedabad, cotton prices have dipped by Rs 500 per candy (356kg) over the past week. The price of the Shankar-6 cotton variety has come down to between Rs 39,800 and Rs 39,900 from Rs 40,300-40,400 per candy. “Cotton exports to China have also slowed mainly because of the Lunar New Year holidays and the shutting down of a dozen Chinese cities to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Payments are being delayed and letters of credit (LCs) are not being honoured as banks are closed due to the holidays,” said Nirav Patel, a city-based cotton exporter. “Consignments are lying at ports and exporters are in a quandary as whether to ship goods to China or not. So far 5-6 lakh bales of cotton have been shipped to China from India and 3 lakh bales are presently stuck,” he added. “60% of the total exports of cotton yarn from spinning units in Gujarat goes to China. With production affected in Chinese factories due to the virus, demand has declined significantly. As a result, the price of 30 combed hosiery cotton yarn, which is exported to China, has gone down from Rs 207/kg to Rs 200/kg,” said Dr Bharat Boghra, chairman, All Gujarat Spinners’ Association (AGSA). “Several chemicals such as H-Acid, vinyl sulphone, J-Acid, Tobias acid, beta naphthol, naphthalene, gamma acid, K-Acid, among others are imported from China. With the outbreak, prices of these chemicals have risen significantly,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Chemexil Gujarat region.“The prices are expected to remain high as the virus has crippled various provinces of China such as Hebei and Guangdong, where various factories are located,” he added. 20% raw material shortage expected Several Indian manufacturers are heavily dependent on China for raw-material imports and the coronavirus outbreak and resultant shutdown in China is expected to affect Indian manufacturers in a big way. Ritesh Goenka, director of an electronics OEM manufacturing company in China, said, “Due to the Chinese New Year, industrial units were to remain shut till February 2. However, based on the notification form the Chinese government, this has been extended to February 10 and it is expected the last even till February 20. As Indian industry is heavily import-dependent on China, a raw-material scarcity to the order or 20-30% of requirement is expected over the next three months.” “The shortage of raw materials will also lead to a significant increase in prices in the Indian market which will affect demand, as local players will wait for prices to fall. Overall, this is expected to hurt sales by at least 30%,” said Goenka. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"US advises no travel to China, where virus deaths top 200 - Times of India","BEIJING: The US advised against all travel to China as the number of cases of a worrying new virus spiked more than tenfold in a week, including the highest death toll in a 24-hour period reported Friday. The virus has infected almost 10,000 people globally in just two months, a worrying sign of its spread among people that prompted the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a global emergency. The State Department's travel advisory told Americans currently in China to consider departing using commercial means, and requested that all non-essential US government personnel defer travel in light of the virus. China as of Friday morning counted 9,692 confirmed cases with a death toll of 213, including 43 new fatalities. The vast majority of the cases have been in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan, where the first illnesses were detected in December. No deaths have been reported outside China. The National Health Commission reported 596 cases have been ""cured and discharged from hospital."" WHO noted most people who got the illness had milder cases, though 20% experienced severe symptoms. Symptoms of the new coronavirus include fever and cough and in severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia. Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it will send charter flights to bring home residents of Hubei from overseas. It gave few details, but said those from Hubei and especially Wuhan would be sent directly back as soon as possible in light of the ""practical difficulties"" they were encountering. China has placed more than 50 million people in the region under virtual quarantine, while foreign countries, companies and airlines have cut back severely on travel to China and quarantined those who recently passed through Wuhan. The virus is believed to have a two-week incubation period, during which those infected can pass on the illness even if they show no symptoms such as fever and cough. Since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December, 18 countries have reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is. Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and WHO noted with its emergency declaration Thursday it was especially concerned that some cases abroad also involved human-to-human transmission. It defines an international emergency as an ""extraordinary event"" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. ""The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. ""Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it. ""This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China,"" he said. ""On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak."" A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries. On Friday, the US Embassy in Beijing said it was authorizing the departure of family members and all non-emergency US government employees from Beijing and the consulates in the cities of Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang. Staff from the Wuhan consulate departed earlier this week. The decision was made ""out of an abundance of caution related to logistical disruptions stemming from restricted transportation and availability of appropriate health care related to the novel coronavirus,"" the embassy said. The level 4 ""Do Not Travel"" advisory is the highest grade of warning. Mike Wester, a businessman in Beijing who has lived in China for 19 years, said he has no plans to leave. ""I feel safer self-quarantining myself here at home than I do risking travel,"" said Wester. He pointed to potential risks from crowds at airports and being required to remove a mask for passport and security checks. Speaking by Skype from Utah, Kelly Flanagan, 36, a school counselor in China since 2011, said she is planning to stay out of China as she watches the virus spread. ""This is probably going to be awhile,"" said Flanagan, who said her Type 1 diabetes added to her health concerns. From the US she is working remotely with her students to help them pass English proficiency exams. Japan and Germany also advised against non-essential travel and Britain did as well, except for Hong Kong and Macao. Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China, where transport links have shut down in places and businesses including Starbucks and McDonald's temporarily closing hundreds of shops. ""There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,"" he said. He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders. China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said Thursday evening in New York that ""we are still at a very critical stage in fighting the coronavirus"" but stressed that the epidemic is still mainly confined to China and urged the international community against any overreaction. He said China appreciated ""the friendly gesture made by the international community"" in providing medical equipment, and ""what are needed urgently,"" especially in Hubei province, are masks and other protective medical supplies including glasses. Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus is worrying. In Japan, a tour guide and bus driver became infected after escorting two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, five employees of German auto parts supplier Webasto became ill after a Chinese colleague visited. The woman had shown no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to China. ""That's the kind of transmission chain that we don't want to see,"" said Marion Koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a member of WHO's emergency committee. On Friday, Thailand said a taxi driver became its first case of person-to-person spread. The Southeast Asian country, a popular travel destination for Chinese, has counted 19 cases in all. The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a cousin of the new virus. Both are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that can cause the common cold. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
"Possible virus case traps 7,000 on cruise ship - Times of India","ROME: A cruise ship owned by Carnival Corp. was blocked from leaving an Italian port with some 7,000 people on board, after a passenger came down with symptoms that raised concerns about a possible case of coronavirus. The ship was bound for La Spezia in the Liguria region, with 1,000 crew and 6,000 passengers, 750 of whom came from China, a port spokesman said Carnival’s Italian unit Costa Crociere SpA said that a 54-year-old woman from Macau is currently in isolation on board its Costa Smeralda cruise ship in the port of Civitavecchia, near Rome. A medical team from a Rome hospital has examined the patient, who demonstrated fever and respiratory symptoms, according to the Italian Coast Guard. The Costa Smeralda case could mark the first case of a cruise ship being affected by the coronavirus. It would also be the first confirmed case of the disease in Italy. Italian media reported that passengers were protesting the lockdown. “We don’t have information, no internet, because on the ship it doesn’t work,” Ansa new agency cited a passenger as saying. “But above all we’re having our meals together in the common areas and we don’t know if someone is infected.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
China rushes to build new hospital for virus within 10 days - Times of India,"BEIJING: China is rushing to build a new hospital in a staggering 10 days to treat patients at the epicentre of a deadly virus outbreak that has stricken hundreds of people, state media reported Friday. The facility in the central city of Wuhan is expected to be in use by February 3 to serve a rising number of patients infected by a coronavirus that has left at least 26 people dead and millions on lockdown in an effort to curb the spread. Dozens of excavators and trucks were filmed working on the site by state broadcaster CCTV. It will have a capacity of 1,000 beds spread over 25,000 square metres, the official Xinhua news agency said. Construction began as reports surfaced of bed shortages in hospitals designated as dealing with the outbreak, which has now infected 830 people across China. Xinhua said the new facility is aimed at ""alleviating the shortage of medical treatment resources and improving the ability to care for patients"". In 2003 China erected a hospital on Beijing's rural outskirts in barely a week to cater to a rapidly rising number of patients suffering from SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed 349 people in mainland China and 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Xiaotangshan Hospital consisted of prefabricated structures and Xinhua reported Friday that Wuhan was building the new facility based on the same model. The city of over 11 million people has been centralising its treatment of the new virus by isolating patients in 61 clinics and designated hospitals. Chinese officials have said the virus likely originated from wild animals at a seafood market in the city but it has since spread to several countries around Asia and beyond. The outbreak has prompted authorities in at least eight Chinese cities to impose travel restrictions and cancel public events to curb the spread.

 Shiv Sena: Why life-threatening viruses always come out of China? | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Claiming that life-threatening viruses often originate in China, the Shiv Sena on Friday said the ""world community"" should find out if pathogens like novel coronavirus are emerging from ""efforts to produce biological weapons"". The outbreak of a new coronavirus was detected in China's Wuhan city earlier this month. The epidemic has killed 170 people and infected more than 7,000 worldwide. In the editorial of its mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Shiv Sena noted that several developed countries including the United States and Japan are combating the new virus. ""But it also needs to be traced how such life-threatening viruses are always spawned in China. China has a biological laboratory where the coronavirus was (first) found,"" it said. ""Experiments are carried out on different animals there ... The world community should also find out if such viruses are emerging out of efforts to produce biological weapons of mass destruction for the future,"" the party said. The Sena, which leads a coalition government in Maharashtra, also suggested that ""special squads"" be formed as a precautionary measure in India's northeastern states which share border with China to stop spread of the disease. In Maharashtra, at least 12 people have been quarantined at government hospitals for possible exposure to the virus, though no confirmed case has been found.

Coronavirus: Two under watch in Mumbai; special ward set up | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Two persons who returned from China were kept under medical observation here for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus which has infected a large number of people in the neighbouring country, a BMC health officer said on Friday. In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has created an isolation ward at its Kasturba hospital in Chinchpokali. ""The isolation ward has been created for diagnosis and treatment of persons suspected to have the coronavirus infection,"" said Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer of the BMC. Keskar said civic health authorities have been kept two persons, who returned from China, under observation for mild cough and exhibiting cold-related symptoms. Further details about the persons kept under surveillance were awaited. She said doctors at the Mumbai International Airport have been asked to send travellers returning from China to the isolation ward if they show any symptoms of the coronavirus. ""All private doctors in the city have been asked to alert us (the BMC) if they observe symptoms of the coronavirus in anyone who has returned from China,"" she said. According to Kasturba Hospital sources, they have received detailed instructions from the Maharashtra government about the coronavirus and how to deal with the illness and they have been instructed to strictly follow those. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed people in China is a novel strain and not seen before. Common symptoms of the novel coronavirus strain include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, according to the WHO.

North Korea says it has intensified efforts to block virus - Times of India,"PYONGYANG: North Korea is intensifying efforts to prevent the spread of a new virus from China into the isolated country by blocking tourists, reducing flights and mobilizing more screening efforts, a health official said Thursday. Kim Dong Gun, a director from the North's Health Ministry, told The Associated Press the North has taken “strong preventative measures so as not to allow this virus come into our homeland.” Kim said the country's anti-epidemic headquarters has strengthened inspections at borders, harbors and airports, while health workers are “exerting all their efforts to find out, segregate and cure any patients and any suspected patients.” Local governments under the guidance of the central public health committee ""are devoting all their energies to block the spread of the novel coronavirus,” Kim said. North Korea has yet to report any illnesses from the new type of coronavirus that was first detected last month in neighboring China. It has sickened thousands, most of them China, but South Korea has reported six cases. Pedestrians and children walking on Pyongyang's streets were wearing face masks. Doctors at the capital's No. 3 Hospital discussed news about the outbreak in China and other countries. Also on Thursday, South Korea said the Koreas have agreed to suspend operations of their liaison office in the North Korean border town of Kaesong until the outbreak is controlled. Dozens of South Korean officials returned home Thursday evening. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said emergency anti-epidemic headquarters have been established in Pyongyang and elsewhere and said the North will maintain an emergency alert status until the risk of infections disappear. The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper recently called the fight against the virus a matter of ""national existence."" North Korea's state media has been increasing its coverage of the outbreak as it grew in number and beyond the epicenter. Before the Lunar New Year holiday, the North began telling foreign embassies and tour operators it had planned strengthened travel controls and quarantine measures. All tourism to North Korea has virtually stopped, while travelers with essential reasons to enter the country can expect a month in quarantine. Flights from Pyongyang to Beijing and Vladivostok have been reduced to a minimum. North Korea took similar precautions during the Ebola outbreak in 2014-2015 and the 2003 spread of SARS. The North even suspended South Korean tours to Diamond Mountain resort for two months in 2003, temporarily depriving itself of a valuable cash source, to guard itself against SARS.

Policymakers fret over risk to global growth from China virus outbreak - Times of India,"By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Leika KiharaWASHINGTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - A rapidly spreading virus outbreak in China is emerging as a potentially major new risk to the global economy and leaving policymakers, still grappling with the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war, fretting over the widening fallout.In a sign of alarm over the possible damage, Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya said on Thursday China's huge presence in the world economy must be taken into account in gauging the impact the outbreak could have on global growth.Stocks around the world tumbled on Thursday as the death toll from the spread of the coronavirus reached 170, forcing airlines to cut flights and some stores to close.The potential impact on the world economy from the outbreak took center stage in U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's news conference on Wednesday.""China's economy is very important in the global economy now, and when China's economy slows down we do feel that - not as much though as countries that are near China, or that trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries,"" Powell said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also voiced concern on Thursday, saying he was closely watching the impact on Japan's economy including declining inbound tourism.Zhang Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, projected the outbreak would cut China's first-quarter growth by one percentage point to 5% or lower.China has imposed travel restrictions and shut businesses to contain the outbreak, but has not quelled rising concern among companies and governments across the world.Asian stocks sank on Thursday as the death toll from the virus rose and more cases were reported around the world.""Apart from the risk to human lives, it is likely to hit travel and consumption activities. In a scenario of widespread infection, it could materially weaken economic growth and fiscal positions of governments in Asia,"" S&P said on Thursday.BIGGER DAMAGE THAN SARSAnalysts are comparing the current coronavirus outbreak to the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which led to about 800 deaths and slowed Asia's economic growth.Many say the impact on global growth could be bigger this time as China now accounts for a larger share of the world economy, a view echoed by BOJ's Amamiya.The number of Chinese tourists visiting Japan has increased by more than 20 times since then, Amamiya said. ""The outbreak also spread during China's Lunar (New Year) holiday, when consumption tends to peak,"" he added.""We're looking very carefully at developments, including how much the impact could spread,"" Amamiya said in a seminar in Tokyo hosted by Jiji news agency.The fallout from the epidemic casts a shadow over the Bank of Japan's projection that global growth will pick up around mid-year and help Japan's economy sustain a moderate recovery.China is Japan's second-largest export destination. The Chinese make up 30% of all tourists visiting Japan and nearly 40% of the total sum foreign tourists spent last year, an industry survey showed.

"China counts 170 virus deaths, new countries find infections - Times of India","BEIJING: China counted 170 deaths from a new virus Thursday and more countries reported infections, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China's worst-hit region returned home to medical observation and even isolation. India and the Philippines reported their first cases, in a traveler and a student who had both been in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the new type of coronavirus first surfaced in December. South Korea confirmed a case that was locally spread, in a man who had contact with a patient diagnosed earlier. Locally spread cases outside China have been a worrying concern among global health officials, as potential signs of the virus spreading more easily and the difficulty of containing it. The World Health Organization is reconvening experts on Thursday to assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency. The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. Thursday's figures for mainland China cover the previous 24 hours and represent an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,711. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Three of Japan's confirmed cases were among a group of evacuees who returned on a government-chartered flight from Wuhan on Wednesday. Japan's foreign ministry said a second flight carrying 210 Japanese evacuees landed Thursday at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Reports said nine of those aboard the flight showed signs of cough and fever. India's health ministry said a student in Kerala state who had been studying in Wuhan was confirmed to have the virus after returning home during the Lunar New Year break. Philippine health officials say a woman who traveled to the country from Wuhan via Hong Kong had tested positive. The United States evacuated 195 Americans from Wuhan who are being tested and monitored at a Southern California military base. A statement from the Embassy in Beijing said additional evacuation flights were being planned for Monday or surrounding days. France, New Zealand, Australia, India, Singapore and other countries are also trying to get out their citizens. Taiwan, the self-governing republic China considers its own territory, has also asked to be able to repatriate its passport holders from Wuhan, but it, and the United Kingdom, said they were awaiting approval from Beijing. In South Korea, residents in two cities where quarantine facilities are being prepared threw eggs and water bottles at government officials to protest plans to isolate in the neighborhood 700 South Koreans the government plans to evacuate from China. Amid reports of shortages in food and daily necessities in hot-spot areas, Chinese authorities are ""stepping up efforts to ensure continuous supply and stable prices,"" the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited ministry of commerce data showing current reserves in Wuhan can ensure a secure supply of rice and cooking oil for more than 15 days, pork and eggs for more than 10 days and vegetables for about five days. China's highly developed online shopping and home delivery businesses were important in ensuring those confined to home by choice or by order could get food and other essentials. ""I'd just like to ask that folks don't order anything other than the daily necessities,"" Hou Yanbo, deputy director of market supervision from the National Post Administration, told reporters at a daily briefing. China extended its Lunar New Year holiday to Sunday to try to contain the virus, but the wave of returning travelers could potentially cause the virus to further spread. Transport ministry spokesman Wu Chungeng outlined a series of rigorous temperature checks and other ""severe measures"" to detect possibly infectious passengers. Transport restrictions such as those isolating Wuhan and suspending inter-provincial bus services would remain in place, Wu said. ""It's definitely very challenging, but we're confident we can exert effective control,"" Wu told reporters at the briefing. School openings in Hong Kong, Beijing and other regions have been extended by at least two weeks. The WHO emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, spoke in Geneva after returning from Beijing. He said China was taking ""extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge"" posed by the outbreak. To date, about 99% of the cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it's likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed. In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS. Scientists say there are many questions to be answered about the new virus, including just how easily it spreads and how severe it is. Chinese authorities have demanded anyone who traveled from or through Wuhan report to health authorities and self-quarantine themselves for 14 days, the maximum incubation period during which patients can be infectious even if they don't show symptoms. China has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumors —a reflection of the one-party Communist state's determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media. That stands in stark contrast to the initial response to SARS, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. The delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people. This time, in addition to working with WHO, China's health minister Ma Xiaowei has been in touch with foreign colleagues, including US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar.

"Wary of irking China, Trump offers rosy take on virus threat - Times of India","WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump had plenty to talk about during his latest big campaign rally, regaling a friendly crowd in New Jersey with his thoughts about impeachment, the economy, the border wall, local politics and much more. But the president was conspicuously quiet about one big issue that has much of the globe on pins and needles: the spread of a deadly new type of coronavirus. A self-described germaphobe, Trump has had little to say in public about the new virus that so far has killed more than 170 people in China, sickened thousands more there and led to a handful of confirmed cases in the U.S. And he speaks in broad terms when he does talk about it. “We're very much involved with them, right now, on the virus that's going around,” Trump said of China before signing a trade deal at the White House on Wednesday. He said he had discussed the situation with Chinese President Xi Jinping and added, “We're working very closely with China.” Aides and confidants say Trump's careful approach is part of a political strategy crafted to avoid upsetting the stock market or angering China by calling too much attention to the virus or blaming Beijing for not managing the situation better, according to a White House official and a Republican close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted out photos from a briefing on the virus he attended with administration officials in the Situation Room, writing that “we have the best experts anywhere in the world and they are on top of it 24/7!” In keeping with the low-profile approach, the White House announced by email Wednesday night that the meeting included members of a task force that will lead the US response to the new virus. The 12-person team is chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and coordinated through the National Security Council. The president's comments contrast sharply with the fierce criticism he lobbed at his predecessor, President Barack Obama, during the 2014-15 Ebola crisis, which left more than 11,000 dead in three West African nations. At the time, Trump ripped into Obama as a “dope” and “incompetent"" and called for a travel ban on visitors from Ebola-infected countries. Trump also advocated preventing infected American health care workers from coming home for treatment. Obama faced some criticism from public health officials for being slow to address the Ebola crisis initially, but also received plaudits for eventually attacking it with vigor. He nudged Congress to make a USD 5.4 billion emergency appropriation to aid the fight and sent 3,000 US troops to West Africa to help with the international response. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said he's taken a measure of comfort in the fact that Trump, so far, hasn't overreacted and has resisted “fanning the flames” as he did with his rhetoric during the Ebola crisis. That leaves room, Gostin said, for public health professionals to take the lead. ""As long as that continues and as long as there isn't political interference or mass quarantines in the U.S. or outright travel bans, I will feel comfortable with how the White House is handling it,” Gostin said. He added that he'd like to see Trump ask Congress for a $1 billion emergency appropriation to help agencies battling to contain the virus. Trump is well aware the virus outbreak in China could create a wild card for the US economy during an election year. And he has long prioritized the US economic relationship with China, especially during trade negotiations, and similarly largely held his tongue during widespread protests in Hong Kong. He also takes enormous pride in the personal relationship he's developed with Xi and has commended him for demonstrating “transparency"" as he deals with the crisis. Trump said “we have it totally under control” when he was asked about the new type of coronavirus while in Switzerland last week to attend an economic conference. And in a separate Twitter posting, he offered reassurance but scant detail for his confidence. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
South Korea confirms second coronavirus case - Times of India,"SEOUL: South Korea on Friday confirmed its second case of the SARS-like virus that has killed at least 25 in China, as concerns mount about a wider outbreak. Several nations including the US have stepped up checks on airport passengers to detect the coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The virus has caused alarm in China and abroad because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. On Friday, Seoul's health ministry said a South Korean man in his 50s started experiencing symptoms while working in Wuhan on Jan 10. He was tested upon returning to the country earlier this week, and was confirmed to be South Korea's second case of the virus on Thursday, the ministry added. ""The patient was adequately aware of the situation in Wuhan ... and cooperated well with the health authorities' requests during the monitoring period after returning home,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Stranded in Wuhan: foreigners raise call for help in virus epicentre - Times of India,"WUHAN: Pregnant, newly wed and now trapped at the Chinese epicentre of a global health crisis, Thai national Aphinya is among thousands of foreigners desperate to escape - and watching helplessly as the US and Japan fly their citizens home.  Hundreds were flown to safety this week to Tokyo, Singapore and California on government-chartered flights, but those from countries with less diplomatic clout fear they are being left behind.  ""I feel hurt that they don't care about us,"" Aphinya Thasripech, 32, told AFP.  ""Either I could starve or I'll get infected and die,"" said the factory worker, who is two months pregnant.  So far 170 people have been killed by the virus since it emerged from a market in Wuhan, and more than 7,700 people have been sickened.  The illness has also spread around the world, with cases being recorded as far away as the United Arab Emirates, Finland and the United States, but all of the deaths have been in China.  China has imposed transport bans in and around Wuhan - effectively trapping tens of millions of people -- including thousands of foreigners - in a bid to contain the virus.  Aphinya arrived in China on two weeks ago to marry her Chinese husband in Xiantao -- about 200 kilometres (120 miles) from Wuhan.  Now the city is a virtual ghost town, with restaurants and shops shuttered.  Aphinya said she is worried for the health of her unborn baby, and desperate for the Thai government to get her out.  For days, the government in Bangkok has said they are awaiting ""permission"" from China to evacuate 65 citizens known to be at ground zero.  But the wait is taking its toll.  ""Sooner or later, it will get to us,"" said Aphinya, adding she had heard that a man had collapsed in a restaurant near her.  Thai medical student Badeephak Kaosala has barricaded himself in his dorm room with a dwindling supply of food and water.  He has watched with disbelief as wealthy nations have mounted mercy flights for their stricken citizens, with no word from home on when -- or if -- he might get out.  ""China has given permission to so many other countries... so we feel really down,"" , 23, told AFP.  -- 'Only fools want to stay' -- South Korea, France and Britain have all announced preparations to evacuate their citizens. Japan has already brought out two plane-loads.  But ""fear, frustration and panic"" is mounting among those still trapped, said Pakistani Ruqia Shaikh, 33, who was visiting friends when the city was locked down.  There are around 500 Pakistani students in Wuhan. Currently four have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, an official in Islamabad has said.  Those with families are eager to leave, said Ruqia, though some students prefer to remain where they are -- happier to take their chances against the disease than run the gauntlet of Pakistan's poor health facilities.  ""Our country is not capable of treating the coronavirus,"" she told AFP.  But Fadil, an Indonesian doctoral student in Wuhan who goes by one name, said he and his friends are desperate to leave -- even if only to another Chinese city.  There are about 100 Indonesians in Wuhan, and another 143 elsewhere in Hubei province.  ""The key thing is that we want to get out of here,"" he said. ""Only fools would want to stay in Wuhan.""  A few Myanmar nationals living in Wuhan have taken to Facebook, issuing public pleas to be brought home.

Coronavirus Disease: What we know about the new coronavirus spreading in China and beyond | World News - Times of India,"An outbreak of a new coronavirus that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has killed 17 and infected nearly 600 people globally. Global health authorities fear the transmission rate will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.  KNOWN CASES China's National Health Commission confirmed 571 cases and 17 deaths at the end of Jan 22. Thailand reported four cases, and South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the United States one each. Patients in these cases were either residents of Wuhan or recent visitors to the city. AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING ORIGINChinese authorities are trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say came from a market in Wuhan where wildlife was traded illegally. The World Health Organization (WHO) says an animal appears most likely to be the primary source. China's National Health Commission Vice Minister Li Bin told reporters on Jan. 22 there was evidence of respiratory transmission of the virus from patient to patient. Chinese authorities say 15 medical staff have been infected. Some experts say the virus may not be as deadly as other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people during a 2002-2003 outbreak also originating from China. COUNTER-MEASURESThere is no vaccine for the new virus, which China says is mutating. Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. Chinese authorities shut down all urban transport networks and suspended outgoing flights from Wuhan as of 0200 GMT Thursday, urged residents to not leave the city and advised against travel into the city. They have also stepped up monitoring and disinfection efforts ahead of the Lunar New Year break that starts on Jan. 24. Airports in the United States and Britain, as well as many Asian countries, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea, stepped up screening of passengers from Wuhan. Russia strengthened sanitary and quarantine controls at entry points. Taiwan advised people not to visit Wuhan unless absolutely necessary and suspended Wuhan tourist groups from visiting the island. Britain, Singapore and Australia also have advised against all but essential travel to the city. The WHO sent directives to hospitals around the world on infection prevention and control. The U.N. body will decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak a global emergency. PUBLIC, COMPANIES REACT While the WHO has yet to recommend trade or travel restrictions, some Chinese travel booking platforms and airlines have offered free cancellations for Wuhan trips. Beyond Wuhan, some Chinese have begun cancelling travel plans for the Lunar New Year and avoiding public areas like cinemas and shopping centres. Companies are handing out masks and warning staff to avoid Wuhan. Shanghai's Disneyland will waive some rescheduling fees for customers who change travel plans. Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd will let passengers to Wuhan change or cancel flights without charge through Feb. 15 and permit cabin crew to wear masks on flights to the mainland.

Virus crisis exposes cracks in China’s facade of unity - Times of India,"From the outside, China’s Communist Party appears powerful and effective. It has tightened its control over Chinese politics and culture, the economy and everyday life, projecting the image of a gradually unifying society. The coronavirus outbreak has blown up that facade. Staff members at the prestigious Union Hospital in Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, have joined others around China in begging online for medical supplies. Videos show patients in Wuhan beseeching medical staff for treatment. Residents of Wuhan and its province, Hubei, are being chased off planes and ousted from hotels and villages. Online critics are comparing current leaders unfavorably with past ones, even though the older generation had its own tarnished record on responding to emergencies. Some people have urged local party officials to kill themselves. As cracks show in China’s veneer of stability, even some with ties to the party leadership are calling for those in power to shine light on divisions rather than papering them over. The crisis has shown that China remains riddled with vulnerabilities that no amount of censorship or strong-arming can hide. “The local government’s tolerance level of different online voices is way too low,” wrote Hu Xijin, the editor of the Global Times newspaper, a nationalist, party-controlled outlet that fiercely defends Beijing from its critics, in a social media post. Government agencies have weakened the checks-and-balances function of the Chinese news media, Hu wrote, citing the example of eight early whistleblowers who were summoned for talks by the Wuhan police. The coronavirus outbreak has already killed more than 130 people and infected almost 6,000 in China, mostly in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei. For online critics of the government’s responses, which at times have been slow or seemingly random, the crisis has prompted a rethinking of the grand trade-off with the party, in which the people have surrendered individual rights for the promise of stability and prosperity. “The current system looks so vibrant yet it’s shattered completely by a governance crisis,” one user wrote on social media site Weibo. “We gave up our rights in exchange for protection,” the user wrote. “But what kind of protection is it? Where will our long-lasting political apathy lead us?” The post was shared over 7,000 times and liked 27,000 times before censors deleted it. Westerners can be easily awed by how quickly and forcefully the Chinese government can mobilize resources and build infrastructure. Even some international public health experts have said they were impressed with the speed and scale of China’s lockdown on more than a dozen cities, which has affected 56 million people. The Chinese propaganda machine has highlighted such abilities as two new Wuhan coronavirus hospitals are built from scratch, to be completed in days. This single-minded pursuit of efficiency masks deep problems. Propaganda videos and flashy new buildings don’t show the toll that this relentless drive can take on people, society or the environment. Many Chinese people are willing to go along. Partly, the state has taught them to think that way. But many are satisfied with the status quo because they believe that the party has kept their interests in mind. The epidemic now threatens to change some of that thinking. Officials in Wuhan initially played down the threat and censored information as the disease spread throughout the country and even internationally. The city and the province then abruptly imposed a lockdown on travel, even though millions had already left for China’s Lunar New Year holiday. Local residents complained that restrictions later imposed on traffic made it difficult for people to get to work and seek medical assistance, perhaps hindering prevention efforts rather than helping them. Wuhan’s medical system was so overwhelmed that videos of overworked medical workers having breakdowns and desperate patients pleading for help circulated widely online. The situation was so dire that Zhang Ouya, a senior reporter at the state-run Hubei Daily, wrote that “Hubei must immediately replace its commanders” on his verified Weibo account. The post was soon deleted, but a screenshot circulated widely. In an official document leaked online, the newspaper apologized to Wuhan officials and promised that its staff would post only positive content. For many people in China, the most unexpected revelation came when local hospitals ran out of supplies and had to ask for donations on social media, going around the Chinese bureaucracy. As the crisis expanded, even hospitals in Beijing and other provinces resorted to public appeals for face masks and protective medical gowns. “I’ve always thought we have the most refined state-run system, which can pool and deploy resources at a moment’s notice,” wrote a Weibo user called Meng Chang, a former journalist in Beijing. But the reality was disappointing, he wrote: “Where is the omnipotent system?” National leaders, meanwhile, look out of touch. As the outbreak became a national crisis, the front page of the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, last week extolled the leadership but didn't mention Wuhan. “There’re no people in the People’s Daily,” one of my WeChat connections, an economist, messaged me. China Central Television, the state broadcaster, featured a banquet held by the leadership to celebrate the country’s successes. On Friday night, the eve of the Lunar New Year, CCTV’s annual holiday broadcast worked in six minutes of praise for Wuhan’s medical workers between the skits and songs. Wuhan’s people went unmentioned. “I was very sad when watching the Spring Festival gala last night,” a woman named Jiujiu told the podcast Gushi FM. “Wuhan has come to this, yet the whole nation still seemed full of great joy.” Some within China’s institutions appear to be trying to fix the problems. While Weibo has censored many posts about the epidemic, it appears to be leaving loopholes for its users to vent. Wang Gaofei, Weibo’s chief executive, posted research by scientists at the University of Washington that showed a correlation between greater news coverage and a reduction in infections. But in a country where history is often rewritten to serve the party’s interests, the lessons of the past can be forgotten. Discussion of SARS, the outbreak that killed hundreds 17 years ago, has been muted. Even as many Chinese people quietly complain about current leaders, they wax nostalgic about the role that former President Hu Jintao played in the SARS epidemic, apparently forgetting that Beijing tried to cover up that outbreak for three months. A video of a CCTV interview with Beijing’s mayor at the time, Wang Qishan, who is now China’s vice president, was viewed over 4 million times in two hours before it was deleted. The comments were full of praises for his candid and confident answers and yearning for a strong leader like him. “It’s not that this nation has a bad memory,” wrote one person who pointed out the irony. “It’s because those in power don’t like that you remember.” The police in various parts of China have fined or detained over 40 people in the past few days for spreading “rumors,” many of which claimed that there were confirmed cases of the virus locally, according to a tally by a WeChat account based on media reports. Wang Heyan, an investigative reporter for the magazine Caixin who has written about corruption cases involving top Chinese leaders, lamented on her WeChat timeline that she and her colleagues couldn’t get any medical workers to talk to them in Wuhan. Even after she promised them anonymity, Wang said, the workers feared reprisals. “If all medical workers aren’t willing to take a little risk to speak the truth and the media can’t report the truth, in the end everyone, including the doctors, will be victims,” she wrote. A reporter from Beijing News also complained on social media that even though he was in the epicenter of the epidemic, he couldn’t write a single word about what he had learned. Many Chinese still have strong belief in the power of the central government. After Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan on Monday, a week after the epidemic became a full-blown crisis, a retiree told my colleague Chris Buckley, “In China, if a leader visits, that shows that all the resources of the government can be mobilized.” Li Haipeng, a former journalist, predicted as early as last week that eventually the state would come to Wuhan’s rescue. “The state will be interpreted, proved and trusted as the only savior,” he wrote on Weibo. “All our stories are the same: They start with the failure of the state and end with its victory.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
Rajasthan alert on China coronavirus | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: An alert has been sounded across the state on novel coronavirus, a virus that has infected over 400 people and caused nine deaths in China. Since many people travel from Jaipur to China for business purposes, the health department has alerted its staff. The state is vulnerable to novel coronavirus as it is a zoonotic disease and the state had reported 16 deaths due to such zoonotic diseases in 2019. In all, 3,111 people had also tested positive for three zoonotic diseases — Scrub Typhus, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) and Brucellosis last year. Since, novel coronavirus is also a zoonotic disease, the health department is taking help of the agriculture department to ward off any chances of novel coronavirus entering the state. “We have alerted all chief medical health officers in the state on coronavirus. We have sent them guidelines and information about the disease,” said Dr KK Sharma, director (health), health department. According to the health department, the clinical signs and symptoms of the virus are mainly fever with a few patients having difficulty in breathing. Moreover, the mode of transmission is unclear as of now. The health department officials said so far there is little evidence of significant human-to-human transmission. Besides, World Health Organisation has issued an advice for international travellers stating that while the cause of the pneumonia seems to be a novel coronavirus, transmission potential and modes of transmission remain unclear. Therefore, it would be prudent to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections while travelling in or from affected areas (currently Wuhan City). WHO pointed out that travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).

"BJP holds protest rally, says ‘JNU virus’ entered Rajgarh | Bhopal News - Times of India","Bhopal: BJP on Wednesday held a massive protest in Rajgarh with the demand to register FIR against the district collector and officials involved in alleged assault of party workers during a pro-CAA rally on Sunday. The party leaders said the incident shows that ‘Jawaharlal Nehru University virus’ has also entered the district. “I have heard that ‘JNU virus’ has also entered Rajgarh. I came to know that the district collector Nidhi Nivedita has studied in JNU. The public of Rajgarh better knows how to eliminate the virus,” said BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya, during the protest rally in Rajgarh-Biaora town. Comparing Sunday’s incident with the JNU protests, the BJP leader further said, “In JNU, the students raise anti-national slogans and also often insult the Tricolour there. Here too, our workers carrying Tricolour were humiliated by government officials, which is a sign of the JNU culture.” BJP had announced to launch an agitation against the Congress government over the Rajgarh incident in which two senior women officials took on some unruly protesters, allegedly for misbehaving with them while trying to take out a pro-CAA rally by defying prohibitory orders under Section 144. In video clips of the Sunday’s incident, Nivedita can be purportedly seen slapping a man and the deputy collector taking on some men who were part of the rally in Biaora. BJP leaders said that they will move court if a case is not registered against Nivedita. The party had also sent a fact-finding team on Monday to assess the cause of the incident. Later, party top leaders decided to reach Rajgarh to register FIR against the officials involved in the assault of its workers. On Wednesday afternoon, BJP state president Rakesh Singh, former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Vijayavargiya and Leader of Opposition (LoP) Gopal Bhargava reached Rajgarh to ensure that an FIR be registered against Nivedita and other officials. They also held a vehicle rally, with top leaders greeting people on a truck and addressed a huge public gathering. Making a scathing attack on the Congress-led Kamal Nath government, former CM Chouhan said that BJP workers will not remain silent. “The officials who had assaulted our workers will face consequences”, he said. “Who gave you (collector) permission to beat (BJP) workers who were peacefully demonstrating with Tricolours in their hands? Don’t be egoistic, else your ego will be crushed. In which law is it written that a person carrying the Indian flag should be beaten up? This would be the last nail in the coffin of the Kamal Nath government,” said Chouhan. The former CM further hit out at the Congress government and said, “Listen Kamal Nath! We will burn your Lanka to ashes. BJP workers do not tease anyone, but when someone teases us, we do not spare them. Never take BJP workers lightly, otherwise you (Congress) will have to pay a very heavy price,” said an agitated Chouhan. Chouhan also said that if cops refuse to take complaint against the administrative officials, the BJP leaders would reach the police station to lodge the FIR. After his threat, police officers reached the stage and took the complaint against the collector and deputy collector. Rakesh Singh and LoP Bhargava also called upon the workers to continue with their awareness campaign in support of the CAA. Singh said that BJP workers will hit the road and the struggle against the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh will continue. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Germany, Japan confirm human-to-human transmission of virus - Times of India","NEW YORK: Health officials on Tuesday reported what appear to be the first known cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Germany and in Japan. Another case was recently reported in Vietnam. The cases show that countries across the world are now faced with the task of limiting the spread of the disease on their own soil, not just seeking to identify and quarantine ailing patients who had travelled from China. Japan’s ministry of health, labour and welfare said the first Japanese national — and the sixth person in Japan overall — to be diagnosed with the coronavirus was a man in his 60s. He had never been to Wuhan, but he had worked as a bus driver earlier this month for two different group tours from that city, officials said. The man began experiencing symptoms on January 14 and was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Tuesday. The infected German, whose case was also confirmed on Tuesday, is a 33-yearold man from Bavaria who had been in contact with a Chinese woman in Germany, officials said. The woman was diagnosed with the virus after flying home to China. The man was in good condition, German officials said. “It was to be expected that the virus would come to Germany,” Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said in a statement on Tuesday. The WHO said on Friday that there appeared to have been a case of human-to-human transmission in Vietnam. The person had never been to China, but had a relative who had visited Wuhan, and was confirmed to have the virus. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."

Xi says China fighting 'demon' virus as nations prepare airlifts - Times of India,"WUHAN: China is battling a ""demon"" virus that has so far killed more than 100 people, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday, as nations readied planes to airlift foreigners trapped at the epicentre of the outbreak. Xi made his remarks during talks with the head of the World Health Organization in Beijing amid growing global concerns about a novel coronavirus that has infected thousands in China and reached more than a dozen other countries. In a development that could cause more jitters abroad, Japan and Germany reported the first confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission outside of China. The infection is believed to have originated in a wild animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where it jumped to humans before spreading rapidly across the country, prompting authorities to enact drastic nationwide travel restrictions in recent days. Countries are also concerned about the fate of thousands of foreigners stuck in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people that has been sealed off by Chinese authorities in a bid to contain the disease. Tokyo deployed a plane to the virus-stricken metropolis late Tuesday that was scheduled to repatriate Japanese nationals on Wednesday, the same day that a US aircraft is expected to bring American citizens back to their homeland. France and South Korea are also planning to fly out their citizens later this week, and several other countries, including Germany, were considering doing the same. ""Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection,"" Xi told WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide,"" the Chinese leader said, pledging that the government would be transparent and release information in a ""timely"" manner. His comments came after anger simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local officials in central Hubei province. Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about this crisis as compared to its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003. But others say local cadres were more focused on projecting stability earlier in January than adequately responding to the outbreak during regional political meetings. Since then, the number of cases has soared -- doubling to more than 4,500 in the past 24 hours. The WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. Until Tuesday, all reported cases in more than a dozen countries had involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. But in Japan, a man in his 60s apparently contracted the virus after driving two groups of tourists from the city earlier in January, the health ministry said. And a 33-year-old German man contracted the disease from a Chinese colleague from Shanghai who visited Germany last week, according to health officials. Vietnam has been investigating a possible case of human-to-human transmission. The development came after countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Philippines announced tighter visa restrictions for people coming from China. China has taken its own drastic steps to stop the virus, which health officials say is passed on between people through sneezing or coughing, and possibly through physical contact. Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at China's National Health Commission, told the official Xinhua news agency on Tuesday that the outbreak could peak in a week or 10 days. Authorities initially sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province late last week, trapping more than 50 million people. China has since extended the Lunar New Year holiday to keep people indoors as much as possible, and suspended a wide range of train services. On Tuesday, authorities urged Chinese citizens to delay any foreign travel ""to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people"". Wuhan, meanwhile, has been turned into a near ghost-town under a lockdown that has largely confined the industrial hub's residents to their homes. With a ban on car traffic, the streets were nearly deserted apart from the occasional ambulance -- although the city's hospitals are overwhelmed. ""Everyone goes out wearing masks and they are worried about the infection,"" said David, a Chinese man who works in Shanghai but ended up trapped in Wuhan after it was put under quarantine.

WHO chief says China virus evacuations not recommended: Report - Times of India,"BEIJING: The World Health Organisation ""does not recommend the evacuation"" of foreign nationals from China's virus-hit Hubei province, the chief of the UN health body, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Tuesday as he called on the international community to remain calm. His remarks during his meeting with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi came as India, US and several other countries are finalising plans to evacuate their citizens from Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak. Over 250 Indians, mostly students, research scholars and professionals are working in Indian and international companies in Hubei province for which Wuhan is the capital where the deadly coronavirus first emerged last month. China on Tuesday reported 24 more deaths from coronavirus epidemic, taking the number of fatalities to 106 as the confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the outbreak stand at 4,515. Crucially from China's point of view, Ghebreyesus said the WHO ""does not recommend the evacuation of nationals, and called on the international community to remain calm and not overreact,"" according to state-run Xinhua news agency. Thousands of foreign nationals from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh besides large number of people from African countries were reportedly held up in the virus-hit province. China has already permitted to evacuate US and various other countries which had Consulates in Wuhan. Ghebreyesus, who is visiting Beijing for talks with Chinese officials on the crisis, appreciated China's efforts in curbing the spread of pneumonia. During his meeting with Wang, Ghebreyesus said the WHO and the international community speak highly of and fully affirm the decisive measures the Chinese government has taken, Xinhua reported. ""The WHO is confident in China's epidemic prevention and control ability,"" he said. After the virus outbreak, China identified the pathogens in record time, shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus with the WHO and other nations, and carried out a series of effective measures to curb the spread of the virus, he said, adding that the power of China's system and the effectiveness of its measures are ""rarely seen in the world"" and are ""admirable."" He said the WHO hopes to strengthen cooperation with China and is willing to provide all necessary help. Wang said China ""appreciates the WHO's objective and just stance and its full recognition to China's anti-virus measures"". ""Your visit to China not only shows your support for China but also injects impetus into China's cooperation with the WHO,"" said Wang. ""We have full capability, confidence and resources to overcome the epidemic at an early date,"" Wang said. China is willing to continuously deepen cooperation with the international community, especially the WHO, in an open and transparent manner to contribute to global public health, Wang said. In New Delhi, Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong also said the WHO ""does not recommend the evacuation of nationals, and called on the international community to remain calm and not overreact."" ""The WHO is confident in China's epidemic prevention and control ability,"" Sun tweeted. On Sunday, the WHO admitted an error in its assessment of the global risk of a deadly virus in China, saying it was ""high"" and not ""moderate"", reports said. The Geneva-based health body said in its latest situation report that the risk was ""very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.""

"China virus spreads to US, Taiwan; claims sixth victim - Times of India","An outbreak of a viral lung illnesses in central China has spread more widely across the Asian nation, sickening several hundred, and global health officials are attempting to contain an illness that has crossed borders to five countries, including the US. Six deaths have been reported and cases have been found five other countries. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said on Tuesday that a case had been identified in Washington state from a person recently travelling in China. Since the new coronavirus was first detected in December in China’s Wuhan province, the number of infections from the has grown to 291, with 139 of them over the past weekend. While the vast majority of the cases are in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in the eastern inland of China, infections have been reported in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhejiang and Henan. Four cases have been confirmed overseas among Chinese travellers in South Korea, Japan and Thailand. A Taiwanese businesswoman who just returned from Wuhan tested positive for the virus, Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control reported on Tuesday. Health officials still don’t know how dangerous the virus is or exactly how it spreads, but the rapid rise in illnesses has prompted tightened borders and a rapid attempt to trace contacts of those who have become ill. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization is scheduled to debate whether to declare the situation a public health emergency of international concern, a designation used for complex epidemics that can cross borders. Russia has tightened border controls with China, and the US has set up airport checkpoints for passengers coming from China. On Tuesday, the US said that it had added new checkpoints in Atlanta and Chicago, in addition to New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Some new cases have involved doctors and nurses, a sign that the virus is being transmitted from person to person. The infection, which can cause pneumonia in patients, has evoked comparisons to SARS. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, originated in China and spread through airports and hospitals around the globe in a matter of months in the early 2000s. While it isn’t clear how the Wuhan virus compares to SARS in strength or transmissibility, with the Chinese New Year travel season about to send billions of people on holiday journeys, no one wants to take a chance. A WHO emergency declaration could include recommendations to restrict travel or trade to stop the outbreak. The agency has formed teams at its Geneva headquarters to study the virus, its spread and its symptoms and is sending a team to China to help gather information, according to David Heymann, an infectious disease researcher in the UK who advises the agency.

On the menu at China virus market: Rats and live wolf pups - Times of India,"SHANGHAI: The food market where China's deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed nine people and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat — setting Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. A price list circulating on China's internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game — 112 items in all. ""Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,"" said the price list for the vendor, ""Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses"". Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from ""wild animals at the seafood market"" though the exact source remains undetermined. China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licenses, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected. The Beijing News published a photo Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy — like the civet or some rats or bats — or for purported health benefits that are unproven by science. But this brings growing human health risks, said Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Program. Walzer said 70 percent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. ""Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,"" he said. ""It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases."" Bats are thought to have spawned SARS, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. SARS was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. Following SARS, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to SARS, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world.

China fighting 'demon' virus as contagion spreads abroad: Xi Jinping - Times of India,"WUHAN: President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that China was in a struggle against a ""demon"" epidemic, as the death toll from the new SARS-like virus soared to 106 and the first cases of human-to-human contagion were detected abroad. Xi made his remarks during talks with head of the World Health Organization in Beijing as a host of nations prepared to airlift their citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

The WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. But global concern has been growing, with Japan and Germany on Tuesday reporting the first human-to-human infections outside China. Until now, all cases in more than a dozen countries involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. In Japan, a man in his sixties contracted the virus apparently after driving two groups of tourists from the city earlier in January, the health ministry said. He was hospitalised with flu-like symptoms on Saturday. On the other side of the world, a 33-year-old German man caught the disease off a Chinese colleague from Shanghai who visited Germany last week, according to health officials. The development came after countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Philippines announced tighter visa restrictions for people coming from China. Experts believe the virus came from a wild animal market in Wuhan and then jumped to humans, with Chinese health officials saying on Tuesday that people infect each other through sneezing or coughing, and possibly through contact. Authorities initially sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province late last week, trapping more than 50 million people. China then halted international and domestic group tours. It also imposed a wide range of travel restrictions inside China, suspending long-distance bus routes and more than 2,000 train services. But with the death toll climbing and more fatalities reported in Chinese cities far away from Wuhan, authorities on Tuesday urged people to delay any foreign travel ""to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people"", the National Immigration Administration said. Wuhan, meanwhile, has been turned into a near ghost-town under a lockdown that has largely confined the industrial hub's 11 million people to their homes. With a ban on car traffic, the streets were nearly deserted apart from the occasional ambulance -- although the city's hospitals are overwhelmed.

China virus toll passes 130 as U.S. weighs flight ban - Times of India,"(Updates death and patient toll from China, U.S. ruling against suspending air traffic)* Death toll from outbreak rises to 132* China confirms 1,459 new cases reported on Tuesday alone* U.S. considers suspending China-U.S. air traffic - sourcesBy Huizhong Wu and Judy HuaBEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The death toll from a new coronavirus in China rose sharply to 132 on Wednesday with nearly 1,500 new cases, heaping pressure on Beijing to control the disease as U.S. officials said the White House was weighing whether to suspend all flights to the country.The White House is holding daily meetings on the outbreak and monitoring China-U.S. flights as a likely source of infections, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters, though it had decided against suspending air traffic on Tuesday.Two U.S. officials said the administration had not taken any options off the table, however, including a temporary ban on flights, if public health data supported the move.Fears of the spreading virus have already pushed airlines around the world to reduce flights to China and global companies to restrict employee travel to the country, while sectors from mining to luxury goods have been shaken by concerns for global growth in the event of a worst-case pandemic.China's National Health Commission on Wednesday said the total number of deaths from the flu-like virus rose by 26 on Tuesday to 132, while the number of confirmed cases rose by 1,459 to a total of 5,974.New cases were also reported around the world, including Germany where four people from the same company were infected after one of them contracted it from a colleague while visiting their workplace in China.The German cases raise concerns about the human-to-human spread of the virus which can be transmitted in droplets from coughs and sneezes and has an incubation period of up to 14 days.Known as ""2019-nCoV"", the newly identified coronavirus emerged late last year in Wuhan, a major transportation hub and capital of central Hubei province with a population of 11 million people.China has since moved to lock down most of Hubei province, with a population around the same as Italy, to contain the epidemic. Most of the confirmed deaths and patients from the outbreak are in Hubei.Health authorities believe the virus originated from an animal and have pointed to a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was traded illegally.The virus has spread to more than a dozen countries and cases such as those in Germany show it is spreading through human contact and not only through travellers from China.Experts say it is too early to know what its death rate will be, since there are likely to be many cases of milder disease going undetected.""The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide,"" state television quoted Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a meeting with World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Beijing on Tuesday.""China will strengthen international cooperation and welcomes the WHO participation in virus prevention... China is confident of winning the battle against the virus.""China's assurances failed to calm investors, however, as and health authorities around the world continued to step up efforts to stop the virus from spreading on their shores.The United States said it was expanding screening of arrivals from China from five to 20 airports and would consider imposing further travel curbs.""All options for dealing with infectious disease spread have to be on the table, including travel restrictions,"" said U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar.From France to Japan, governments were organising evacuations, while Hong Kong - scene of anti-China unrest for months - planned to suspend rail and ferry links with the mainland. United Airlines said it was suspending some flights between the United States and China for a week from Feb. 1 due to a ""significant decline in demand.""The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said a chartered plane would pick up its consular staff on Wednesday. The European Commission said it would help fund two aircraft to fly EU citizens home, with 250 French nationals leaving on the first flight.

Hong Kong halts trains from mainland China as virus spreads - Times of India,"BEIJING : Hong Kong's leader announced Tuesday that all rail links to mainland China will be cut starting Friday as fears grow about the spread of a new virus. Chief Executive Carrie Lam, wearing a green surgical mask, said both the high-speed rail station and the regular train station would be closed. She stopped short of a total closing of the border but said that flights from the mainland would also be reduced. China's death toll from a new viral disease that is causing mounting global concern rose by 25 to at least 106 on Tuesday as the United States and other governments prepared to fly their citizens out of the locked-down city at center of the outbreak. The total includes the first death in Beijing, the Chinese capital, and 24 more fatalities in Hubei province, where the first illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus occurred in December. Asian stock markets tumbled for a second day, dragged down by worries about the virus's global economic impact. The U.S. Consulate in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where authorities cut off most access Jan. 22 in an effort to contain the disease, was preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the city on Wednesday. Japan and South Korea said they would send planes to Wuhan this week to evacuate their citizens. France, Mongolia and other governments also planned evacuations. China's increasingly drastic containment efforts began with the suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to 17 cities with more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed. China extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Sunday to reduce the risk of infection by keeping offices and factories nationwide closed and the public at home. Authorities in Shanghai, a global business center and home to 25 million people, extended the holiday in that city by an additional week to Feb. 9. U.S. health officials expanded their recommendation for people to avoid non-essential travel to any part of China, rather than just Wuhan and other areas most affected by the outbreak. Mongolia closed its vast border with China and North Korea said it was strengthening quarantine measures. Hong Kong and Malaysia are barring visitors from Hubei. Chinese travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide. There were 1,771 new cases confirmed in China on Monday, raising the national total to 4,515, according to the National Health Commission. It said 976 people were in serious condition. The government has sent 6,000 extra medical workers to Wuhan from across China, including 1,800 who were due to arrive Tuesday, a commission official, Jiao Yahui, said at a news conference. A baby boy was delivered by surgery in Wuhan after his 27-year-old mother was hospitalized as a ``highly suspected'' virus case, state TV reported. The mother, who has a fever and cough, was 37 weeks pregnant, or two weeks less than a standard full term. Doctors wore protective masks and clothing for the delivery Friday at Union Hospital. ``It was unlikely for her to be able to give natural birth,'' said the hospital's deputy director of obstetrics, Zhao Yin. ``After the baby was born, the mother would suffer less pressure in her lungs and she could get better treatment.'' Also Tuesday, the Education Ministry canceled English proficiency and other tests for students to apply to foreign universities. The ministry said the new semester for public schools and universities following Lunar New Year was postponed until further notice. The Hong Kong government announced some government offices would remain closed until at least Monday and non-essential public employees were allowed to work from home. Chinese financial markets were closed for the holiday, but stock indexes in Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney all declined. Beijing's official response has ``vastly improved'' since the 2002-03 SARS outbreak, which also originated in China, but ``fears of a global contagion are not put to bed,'' said Vishnu Varathan at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. Airlines, resorts and other companies that rely on travel and tourism suffered steep losses. Prices of gold and bonds rose as traders moved money into safe haven holdings. The Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the world's busiest, announced it was postponing the resumption of trading after the holiday by three days to Monday. Scientists are concerned about the new virus because it is closely related to other diseases including SARS, which killed nearly 800 people. So far, the new coronavirus doesn't seem to spread as easily among people as SARS or influenza. Most of the cases that spread between people were of family members and health workers who had contact with patients. That suggests the new virus isn't well adapted to infect people. China has reported eight cases in Hong Kong and five in Macao, and more than 45 cases have been confirmed elsewhere in the world. Almost all involve mainland Chinese tourists or people who visited Wuhan. On Tuesday, Taiwan said two 70-year-old tourists from Wuhan had been confirmed to have the disease, raising its total to seven cases. Thailand reported six members of a family from Hubei were new cases, raising its total to 14. Germany confirmed its first case late Monday. Infections also have been confirmed in the United States, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Canada, Australia and Sri Lanka. The five American cases _ two in southern California and one each in Washington state, Chicago and Arizona _ are people who had recently arrived from central China. Health officials said they had no evidence the virus was spreading in the United States and they believe the risk to Americans remains low. During the SARS outbreak, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak. Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week. The coronavirus family includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia. The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a Wuhan market. China on Sunday banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them.

Coronavirus: China virus toll rises to nine as pandemic fears grow - Times of India,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI: The death toll from a new flu-like coronavirus in China rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases, Chinese health officials said as authorities stepped up efforts to control the outbreak by discouraging public gatherings in Hubei province. Another 2,197 people who came into contact with infected people were isolated, with 765 so far released from observation, National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin told reporters, adding that there was already evidence that the virus was being spread through ""respiratory transmission"". ""Recently there has been a big change in the number of cases, which is related to our deepening our understanding of the disease, improving diagnostic methods and optimising the distribution of diagnostic kits,"" Li said. As China vowed to tighten containment measures in hospitals, the World Health Organization (WHO) was due to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency. The virus, originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Macau, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. The Chinese government has been providing daily updates on the number of cases in a bid to head off public panic, as millions of people prepare to travel domestically and abroad for the country's Lunar New Year celebrations starting this week. ""At present, during the Lunar New Year, the rise in the mobility of the public has objectively increased the risk of the epidemic spreading and the difficulty of prevention and control,"" Li warned, noting that the mutation of the virus could also bring further risks. Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, said on Wednesday he was advising company employees not to visit China over the coming Lunar New Year holiday, amid concerns over the virus. Fears of a pandemic similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people in 2002-2003 have roiled global markets, with aviation and luxury goods stocks hit particularly hard and the Chinese yuan tumbling. On Tuesday the death toll stood at six with about 300 confirmed cases. WHO SAYS MORE CASES EXPECTEDWHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said new cases of the coronavirus would appear as China stepped up monitoring. Li said there was as yet no evidence of ""super-spreaders"" capable of disseminating the virus more widely, as happened during the SARS outbreak. Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected in China. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The viral infection can cause pneumonia and be passed from person to person. Though the origin of the virus has yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan's seafood market. The new virus was adapting and mutating, underscoring the challenges for health authorities in controlling the outbreak, Gao Fu, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news briefing. Officials found to have covered up infections would be a ""sinner for eternity before the Party and the people"", the Chinese Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Commission said in a post on its WeChat social media account that was subsequently deleted. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called on China on Wednesday to share ""correct"" information about a new coronavirus and for the WHO not to exclude Taiwan from collaboration on the outbreak for political reasons. Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organisations unless it accepts it is part of China. Taiwan on Tuesday confirmed its first case of the coronavirus, a woman returning to Taiwan from Wuhan. Taiwan joined Australia in warning citizens to avoid travel to Wuhan, and airports around the world have stepped up screening of travellers from China. Tsai also ordered tour groups from Wuhan not to come to Taiwan for the time being. The Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed on Wednesday its first case of pneumonia linked to the newly identified coronavirus and tightened body-temperature screening measures in casinos and around the city. Several foreign tour operators said North Korea will ban foreign tourists starting Wednesday due to the spread of the virus. The vast majority of tourists to North Korea come from China, Pyongyang's main supporter. North Korea is estimated to earn millions of dollars from the steady flow of Chinese tourists. Tourism is one of the last major ways that North Korea can legally earn foreign cash due to international sanctions. VIRUS IMPACTS OLYMPICS QUALIFYINGQualifying boxing matches for Asia and Oceania region for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo set to take place in Wuhan in February have been cancelled due to fears over the virus, Japan's Kyodo news agency said on Wednesday. However, the Australian women's soccer team, the Matildas, were still preparing for a trip to Wuhan for Olympic qualifiers early next month, head coach Ante Milicic has said. Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, one of the airlines affected the most by the SARS outbreak, said it would allow flight attendants to wear a surgical mask while operating mainland China flights due to concerns over the new virus. The Cathay Pacific Airways Flight Attendants Union said it had received a ""tremendous"" amount of messages from members concerned over catching the virus, and attendants on all flights should have the option to wear a mask. ""All of them are worried about the risk they are taking every time they go to work,"" the union said on its Facebook page. Cathay's website said that with immediate effect, rebooking, rerouting and refund charges would be waived for all tickets arriving to or departing from Wuhan through Feb. 15. China's aviation regulator late on Tuesday told mainland carriers to refund or change flights to Wuhan without charge at the request of passengers, which analysts at Daiwa said had affected more than 24 airlines. Some other travel firms are also allowing free cancellations on bookings to Wuhan. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
"What is Coronavirus: Everything we know about Coronavirus symptoms, infection, disease, precautions, | India News - Times of India","Even as the Union Health Ministry has sounded an alert at international airports for thermal screening of passengers arriving from China for the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) — also known as the Wuhan virus — the WHO is convening an Emergency Committee later today to discuss steps to contain its spread. Macau confirmed on Wednesday its first case of pneumonia linked to an outbreak of a new coronavirus strain in the central mainland China city of Wuhan, China's state news agency Xinhua said. The death toll from the new flu-like coronavirus in China rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases. The virus, originating in Wuhan at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. So what’s Coronavirus and how can it be prevented?  What is CoronavirusCoronavirus is an umbrella term for viruses that cause illness ranging from common cold to diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). TransmissionAccording to the WHO, CoV are zoonotic — meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans, though the 2019-nCoV, suspected to have spread from consumption of seafood, is now starting to spread from human to human as well. This can happen when an uninfected person comes into contact with the secretions of an infected person — such as via sneezing, handshake or cough. In fact, several such CoV are present among animals which haven't yet infected humans. FYI: MERS was said to have spread from camels to humans while the needle of suspicion for SARS rests on civet cats. SymptomsAs per WHO, ""common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.""  Why is it 'novel'2019-nCoV is a new strain of CoV, discovered in 2019 which is why it's written as 2019-nCoV. It's called novel since this strain has previously not been detected in humans. It was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China — which is why it's also called the Wuhan virus — and brought to WHO's notice on December 31, 2019 after cases of pneumonia caused by unknown reasons came to light.  Is it fatal?Yes, unfortunately. So far, of the nearly 300 cases of the 2019-nCoV that have been detected — 291 in China, 2 in Thailand and 1 each in South Korea, Japan and now, even the US — there have been 6 deaths, all of them in China, including 2 on Tuesday. However, a report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London puts the total number of infected people at 1,700. Is there a cure?Unfortunately, right now there's no known cure or vaccine for the 2019-nCoV or for the other CoV. This means that prevention is the best option to reduce the risk of infection — which includes avoiding contact with people who are sick as also avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth, in addition to frequently washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds.

Motegi said the government is making arrangements for additional flights that will leave for Wuhan as early as Wednesday. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
"Kolkata in sick bay as temperature swing spreads cold, fever | Kolkata News - Times of India","KOLKATA: A late-winter temperature fluctuation has activated a spate of viruses in Kolkata, leading to the spread of cough and cold infection, accompanied by fever. Children and the elderly have been affected in large numbers. With the mercury unlikely to settle till at least the end of this week, the outbreak may not end soon. It might complicate matters if the dreaded coronavirus, now raging in China and had similar symptoms, reached the city, feared experts. The city’s maximum temperature swayed violently last week, jumping from 22 degrees Celsius to 29 degrees before sliding down to 22 degrees again. It could rise again, predicted the Met office. Such frequent temperature variations help viruses multiply, especially when the mercury slides up. “Most common viruses, like rhino, human meta-pneumo and the influenza virus die out in cold. They start multiplying when the ambient temperature and humidity rises, which is happening now. When the temperature remains low, our immune system and body temperature adapt to the change. If the mercury shoots up suddenly, it fails to adjust to the alteration, making us vulnerable to viral attacks,” said AMRI Hospital consultant Debashish Saha. A traffic sergeant with the Kolkata Police contracted a respiratory tract infection and had to be admitted to a private hospital off EM Bypass this week. According to doctors, he had shed his warm clothes during the afternoon heat last week and consumed chilled water. “But the temperature dropped immediately after that. His system was rendered vulnerable by the temperature change and this is a classic case of a viral attack. There are thousands like him across the city now,” said Fortis Hospital internal medicine consultant Joydeep Ghosh. While rhino virus, human meta-pneumo virus and influenza virus are likely to have struck, it is difficult to identify them unless a test is carried out. But the state doesn’t have the facility. It is the viral fever with severe cough that has doctors worried as it has been striking children more frequently. “A persistent cough has struck scores of children over the last one week. In some cases, it is accompanied by fever. Those with a history of respiratory illnesses, like asthma, have been suffering more than the rest. Children are more vulnerable due to their low immunity and the fact that they are more likely to catch an infection from their school or while travelling by public transport,” said paediatrician Shantanu Ray. The common viruses trigger similar symptoms, which recede in three-five days, according to consultant P K Nemani. “But a bacterial infection can lead to complications and delay recovery. The elderly and children are vulnerable,” said Nemani. Seasonal viruses were highly contagious, so an outbreak was difficult to prevent in winter, said Belle Vue Clinic critical care consultant Samarjit Naskar. “These viruses are transmitted through sneeze and cough droplets, which can travel six feet. So, public places and transport usually help spread them. The only option is to use handkerchiefs and not to touch objects with bare hands,” said Naskar.

Wuhan mayor says willing to resign if it helps contain virus - Times of India,"BEIJING: The mayor of the Chinese city where a deadly virus broke out says he would be willing to resign if it helps the government contain its spread. Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV that both he and Wuhan's Communist Party secretary are willing to take responsibility for closing off the city, including being removed from office. As the virus spread through China and overseas, transportation links to the city were cut last week to prevent more people from leaving. Zhou also responded to allegations that the city was slow to disclose information in the early days of the outbreak, saying local governments are restricted from releasing information about infectious diseases without authorization. Public health officials in Canada said Monday that the wife of the man who is Canada's first case of the emerging virus from China has also tested positive for the virus. Ontario said the woman has been in self-imposed isolation since arriving in Toronto with her husband last week. Ontario Chief Medical Officer of health David Williams said the woman tested positive for the virus at Ontario's public health laboratory. He said because she has been in self-isolation, the risk to Canadians remains low. But Canadian officials have been reaching out to those aboard the China Southern Airlines flight who sat within two meters (6 1/2 feet) of the man. Public health officials said the woman's husband, a man in his 50s, had been showing mild symptoms on his flight from Guangzhou, China, to Toronto. His first flight started in Wuhan. Cambodia's health minister says a Chinese visitor to a popular resort is his country's first case of the new virus. Hong Kong has confirmed two more cases of a new virus that started in central China, raising its total to eight. Thailand's prime minister has spoken on television to try to reassure citizens that his government is taking all possible measures to cope with the outbreak of a deadly pneumonia-like virus in China. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha spoke Monday as public concerns rose after eight cases of the virus had been confirmed in the country, seven of them visitors from China and one Thai. He said authorities so far '""are able to control the situation 100%, but we should not be careless."" The prime minister said ""suitable measures"" have been taken to control the outbreak, including monitoring at the country's five international airports. Chinese health authorities said the new coronavirus had infected 2,744 people and killed 80 as of midnight Sunday. Germany's foreign minister says his country is considering evacuating its citizens from Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the center of a outbreak of a pneumonia-like virus that has killed 80 people so far.

 Virus in China boosts demand for made-in-India face masks | India News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: The demand for N95 masks in China, where people continue to walk with masks over the nose and mouth to protect themselves against the coronavirus, is making Indian manufacturers and dealers of the special safety gear smile. It has also led to an increase in cost by at least 50%. With common disposable surgical masks considered ineffective against large, infectious particles, experts are asking people at risk — health workers and care givers — to use the N95. “But many in China are wearing it. N95 offers better protection by filtering out small particles,” said Manoj Vakharia, treasurer of Scientific and Surgical Dealers and Manufacturers Association (SIDMA). “Now, instead of importing from China, many dealers here are exporting them to that country.” With China limiting exports, many Asian countries are now approaching Indian dealers. “We are sending boxes of masks we bought from China. Apart from this we are procuring fresh ones directly from manufacturers here,” said Anil Gupta of Mumbai-based Avishankar International Private Limited. On Monday, several Indian manufacturers hiked prices. “Dealers here used to buy N95 masks at Rs 25 a piece. Now, it is at least Rs 38. Some other varieties such as N95plus are sold at a much higher price. Manufacturers are also demanding that we pay 100% money in advance,” said Chennai-based J Jayaseelan, chairman of Indian Drug Manufacturers Association. Corporates placing orders have just two demands — the masks should be National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified and delivered in a week. Dealers say this may not be possible as Indian manufacturing units don’t have large capacities. “China is the largest manufacturer of masks and India 1% of it. This is first time we are getting orders from there…,” said Nikunj Kedia, director, Bellcross Industries. “A mask costing Rs 25-Rs 30 a unit is being exported at Rs 60-Rs 70 a unit,” he said. His company manufactures wide range of disposables such as disposable cap, gloves, masks and surgical drapes, among others. Shiv Kumar Mangal, CEO of Faridabad-headquartered Manglam Medikits which has received orders from Hong Kong and Europe, said, “There is a bit of panic due to which existing supplies are being bought even at higher prices.” Customers are not hesitating to order the consignment via air, he said. “We have flown a couple of consignments to Hong Kong.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"Mongolia closes border, China extends holiday to fight virus - Times of India","BEIJING (AP) — China expanded its sweeping efforts on Monday to contain a dangerous new virus, extending the Lunar New Year holiday to keep the public at home and avoid spreading infection as the death toll rose to 81. Mongolia closed its vast border with China, and Hong Kong and Malaysia announced they were barring entry to visitors from the Chinese province at the center of the outbreak following a warning by Chinese officials that the virus’ ability to spread was growing. Travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide, adding to the rising economic losses.Stock markets around the world were down sharply Monday as investors worried the outbreak could hurt the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 550 points following a sell-off in in markets in Europe and Japan, and closed with a loss of 453 points, or 1.6%. Airlines, resorts and other companies that rely on travel and tourism suffered steep losses, while apparel and technology companies that get a significant amount of revenue from China also declined.China has confirmed more than 2,700 cases of the new virus, most in the central city of Wuhan where the illness first surfaced last month. More than 40 cases have been confirmed elsewhere in the world with virtually all of them involving Chinese tourists or people who visited Wuhan recently.China's increasingly drastic containment efforts began with the Jan. 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China where the virus was first detected last month. That lockdown has expanded to 17 cities with more than 50 million people — the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed. The end of the Lunar New Year holiday, China’s busiest travel season, was pushed back to Sunday from Thursday to “reduce mass gatherings” and “block the spread of the epidemic,” a Cabinet statement said. The government of Shanghai, a metropolis of 25 million people and a global business center, extended the Lunar New York holiday by an additional week to Feb. 9. It ordered sports stadiums to close and religious events to cancel.Tens of millions of people in China and around Asia had been due to crowd into planes, trains and buses to return to work after visiting their hometowns or tourist sites for the holiday. Schools will postpone reopening until further notice, the Cabinet said.The death toll rose Monday when the southern island province of Hainan in the South China Sea reported its first fatality, an 80-year-old woman whose family arrived from Wuhan on Jan. 17. Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, has accounted for 76 of the deaths reported so far. There have been one each in Shanghai and the provinces of Hebei in the north, Heilongjiang in the northeast and Henan in central China. The spread of the illness is being watched around the globe, with a small number of cases appearing in other countries. Sri Lanka confirmed its first case Monday. Cases also have been confirmed in the United States, Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Canada and Australia. As of Monday, there were five Americans diagnosed with the virus in Washington state, Chicago, Southern California and Arizona. U.S. health officials said Monday they had no evidence the virus was spreading in the U.S. and they believe the risk to Americans remains low. China also reported eight cases in Hong Kong and five in Macao. Dr. Chuang Shuk-kwan, the head of Hong Kong's communicable disease branch, said the city's eight cases all have Hubei ties, so there was no no sign yet that it is spreading to Hong Kong's general population.Mongolia is the second country to close its border with China, following North Korea. Neither has reported any cases of the virus. Mongolia also closed its schools, universities and playgrounds for more than a month — until March 2.China’s No. 2 leader, Premier Li Keqiang, visited Wuhan to “guide epidemic prevention work,” the Cabinet website said. Photos showed Li, in a blue smock and green face mask, meeting hospital employees.Later, the premier, wearing a face mask and a dark windbreaker, visited a supermarket in the beleaguered city. Shoppers, also wearing masks, cheered to him, “Happy New Year!”“To get the epidemic under control in Wuhan and the good health of people in Wuhan will be good news for the whole country,” Li told the crowd. Elsewhere, the Potala Palace in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, closed indefinitely to tourists on Monday. The former imperial palace in Beijing closed Friday and other major tourist sites also have shut down, including two of Hong Kong's most popular tourist attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park.The disruption to industry and consumer spending threaten to depress Chinese economic growth that Beijing is struggling to shore up after it sank to a multi-decade low of 6.1% last year. That could spread shock waves to other Asian economies that rely on China as a source of tourists and export markets. The outbreak is a “notable downside risk” to growth, though it could potentially be a “high impact but short-lived event,” said Tommy Wu and Priyanka Kishore of Oxford Economics in a report. They pointed to the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, when economic activity plunged but recovered relatively quickly. The impact should be less severe than SARS because of faster official reaction and “increased transparency,” they said. Abroad, economies including Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines with big tourism industries that rely on Chinese travelers “seem most at risk,” said Wu and Kishore. The U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, said it was arranging to evacuate its diplomats and some American citizens on Tuesday. The French government said it would fly its citizens in Wuhan to France and quarantine them there. Japan also was preparing to fly its citizens out of Wuhan.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his government is considering evacuating its estimated 90 citizens in Wuhan.The National Health Commission said 2,744 cases in mainland China were confirmed by midnight Sunday. The youngest is a 9-month-old girl in Beijing. China's health minister, Ma Xiaowei, warned Sunday that the country was entering a “crucial stage"" as “it seems like the ability of the virus to spread is getting stronger."" The epidemic has revived memories of the SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people. Then, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak. The National Health Commission said anyone traveling from Wuhan is required to register with community health stations and quarantine themselves at home for 14 days — the virus' maximum incubation period.Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week. The virus is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan. On Sunday, authorities banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them.___Associated Press video journalist Alice Fung in Hong Kong and writers Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Frank Jordans in Berlin and Carlo Piovano in London contributed to this story.This story has not been edited by The Times of India and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News.(This story has not been edited by timesofindia.com and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.)"

Fig leaf or first defence? Deploying flimsy masks against virus - Times of India,"BANGKOK: As fears of a deadly virus sweep the globe, panicked members of the public are depending on a flimsy first line of defence — surgical masks that are coveted, but in short supply and of limited use. While Asian commuters cover their noses and mouths with the blue-green paper-thin covers — and social media buzzes with mask emojis, rumours of stockpiles and shortages — the humble medical mask has become an essential weapon in the battle against an invisible enemy. Cheap, mass-made and usually readily available at convenience stores, experts dispute the usefulness of masks as a tool to block transmission of the new SARS-like virus. While the basic, loose-fitting mask can help restrict the spread of cough droplets from infected people, they are a ""one-way"" defence and do not create an effective barrier to breathing in dangerous airborne microbes. ""It is not one of the recommended barrier measures"" for people who have not been contaminated, according to France's health minister Agnes Buzyn. Satoshi Hiroi, a senior researcher at the Osaka Institute of Public Heath, told AFP, that high-quality masks could be effective, referring to more expensive, tight-fitting respirators used to filter fine particulates of dust and pollution. ""But as always, there is no 100-percent guarantee,"" he said, adding, the science was still out on exactly how the virus — which has so far killed 106 people and infected over 4,000 — is transmitted. Still, on Bangkok's streets many members of the public put faith in surgical masks on Tuesday, an act of self-defence in worrying times. ""I'm very concerned about the virus,"" Tanyamon Jamophast, 28, told AFP. ""Everywhere I go (in addition to a mask) I also bring alcohol and gel sanitiser to clean my hands and avoid areas with Chinese tourists."" Others wore heavier duty — and more effective — PM2.5 or 3M (N95) masks, in a city shrouded for weeks by damaging pollution. Fourteen infections, all but one detected in Chinese visitors, have been reported in Thailand, a peak season destination for the tour groups from the mainland. For chemist Suphak Saphakkul that has led to the most intense panic-buying of medical items he has witnessed since the SARS epidemic in 2002/3. ""All our (mask) suppliers are out of stock. These masks are made in China and the country itself is out of stock,"" he said. ""We know that it does not provide 100 percent protection but it is better than nothing ... (and) it can also reassure the public."" Even for those who have one, there is a proper method to masking up. On Monday the mayor of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, took an online battering after wearing his mask inside-out. ""You can inhale the virus if there is a gap between the mask and the face,"" added Satoshi Hiroi of the Osaka Institute of Public Heath. Meanwhile the Hubei provincial governor was pilloried for not wearing a mask during a press conference — contravening an order to cover-up in public. Regular hand washing with soap, alcohol rubs and avoiding touching one's face as well as crowded places are endorsed by the World Health Organization as effective personal hygiene habits against infection. The advice has not stopped a run on the shelves, stockpiling or price hikes for medical masks, from Cambodia to Tokyo and Hubei to Hong Kong, where queues stretched outside the remaining retailers with stocks. In Bangkok, it is a case of better safe than sorry. ""I just want to be as careful as I can,"" said 50-year-old commuter Apinya Sukprasitchai.

Rupee widens losses to third day as China virus spreads fears - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The rupee weakened by 10 paise to close at 71.43 against the US currency on Monday, extending losses for a third straight session, amid fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak in China stoking fears about more trouble for the global economy. The domestic currency has lost 24 paise in the last three trading sessions. At the interbank foreign exchange market on Monday, the rupee opened on a weak note at 71.51. During the day, the local unit reclaimed some lost ground and finally settled for the day at 71.43 against the US dollar, down 10 paise over its previous close.

Sharma further said that fresh cues for the rupee will depend on the Union Budget, scheduled on February 1, and dollar demand from central banks. Moreover, high volatility is likely this week as two major central banks policy decision -- Bank of England (BoE) and US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) -- is scheduled. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, rose by 0.02 per cent to 97.87. Meanwhile, the 10-year Indian government bond yield was at 6.56 per cent. Forex dealers said the Indian rupee and bonds declined in line with other Asian peers after intensifying coronavirus spread from China to other countries. However, from India's perspective it was a respite that benchmark Brent crude oil prices moderated to $59.04 per barrel, down 2.51 per cent. The fall in crude prices was attributed to expected demand slump over rising Coronavirus cases in China.

"China virus outbreak: US, Japan prepare evacuation; toll rises to 56 - Times of India","BEIJING: The new virus accelerated its spread in China with 56 deaths so far, and the US Consulate in the epicenter of the outbreak, the central city of Wuhan, announced on Sunday it will evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight. Meanwhile, Japan too said it will evacuate all its nationals from Wuhan. Mayor of China's Wuhan expects another 1,000 virus cases in the city""We have decided to send back all (Japanese citizens in Wuhan) to Japan if they wish so, by every means including a chartered flight,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters. Chinese President Xi Jinping called the outbreak a grave situation, and the government stepped up efforts to restrict travel and public gatherings while rushing medical staff and supplies to Wuhan, which remains on lockdown. Anyone traveling from Wuhan is now required to register with community health stations and quarantine themselves at home for 14 days, according to an order from the National Health Commission. The latest figures reported Sunday morning cover the previous 24 hours and mark an increase of 15 deaths and 688 cases for a total of 1,975 infections. The government also reported five cases in Hong Kong, two in Macao and three in Taiwan. Small numbers of cases have been found in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the US, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France and Australia. Canada said it discovered its first case, the man in his 50s who recently flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou, China, and then on to Toronto. A notice from the US Embassy in Beijing said there would be limited capacity to transport US citizens on the Tuesday flight from Wuhan that will proceed directly to San Francisco. It said that in the event there are not enough seats, priority will be given to to individuals ""at greater risk from coronavirus."" The French Consulate also was considering an evacuation of its nationals from the city. It said it's working on arranging a bus service to help French citizens leave Wuhan. French automaker PSA Group said it will evacuate its employees from Wuhan, quarantine them and then bring them to France. The Foreign Ministry said it was working on ""eventual options"" to evacuate French citizens from Wuhan ""who want to leave."" It didn't elaborate. An Ethiopian student in Wuhan told The Associated Press that it's becoming difficult to buy food and the situation was worsening. ""There are more than 100 Ethiopian students who are studying in Wuhan, and 300 in Hubei province,"" said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for his safety. ""We fear that we will be sick soon. Our school didn't arrange anything ... (other than) giving us masks."" He did not say which school. Also Sunday, two of Hong Kong's biggest attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park, announced they were closing for the time being. ""As a precautionary measure in line with prevention efforts taking place across Hong Kong, we are temporarily closing Hong Kong Disneyland park out of consideration for the health and safety of our guests and cast members,"" the park said in a statement. It said a reopening date would be announced based on the advisement of local authorities. Travel agencies have been told to halt all group tours, and concern is growing over the potential impact of millions of people traveling back to the cities after the Lunar New Year holiday ends on Thursday. The vast majority of the infections and all the deaths have been in mainland China, but fresh cases are popping up. Singapore reported its fourth case on Sunday, a 36-year-old man from Wuhan. The Health Ministry said he did not exhibit any symptoms on his flight. He developed a cough the next day, sought treatment on Jan. 24 and was immediately isolated. South Korea confirmed its third case, according to Yonhap news agency. In the heart of the outbreak where 11 million residents are already on lockdown, Wuhan banned most vehicle use, including private cars, in downtown areas starting Sunday. The city will assign 6,000 taxis to neighborhoods to help people get around if they need to. Wuhan plans to build a second makeshift hospital with about 1,000 beds to handle the growing number of patients. The city has said another hospital was expected to be completed Feb. 3. Medical workers in Wuhan have been among those infected and local media reported a doctor died on Saturday morning. The 62-year-old physician worked at the ear, nose and throat department at Hubei Xinhua Hospital. He was hospitalized on January 18 and died a week later. Xinhua also said medical supplies are being rushed to the city, including 14,000 protective suits, 110,000 pairs of gloves and masks and goggles. The National Health Commission said it is bringing in medical teams to help handle the outbreak, a day after videos circulating online showed throngs of frantic people in masks lined up for examinations and complaints that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity. The Chinese military dispatched 450 medical staff, some with experience in past outbreaks, including SARS and Ebola, who arrived in Wuhan late Friday to help treat many patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia, Xinhua reported. The new virus comes from a large family of what are known as coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal. China cut off trains, planes and other links to Wuhan on Wednesday, as well as public transportation within the city, and has steadily expanded a lockdown to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million — greater than that of New York, London, Paris and Moscow combined. A growing number of cities and provinces were enacting their own travel restrictions to contain the virus. The city of Shantou, almost 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southeast of Wuhan, was banning bus, taxi, ferry and car-hailing services from Monday. Only those authorized would be allowed to enter the city to maintain supplies or provide services. Shantou has reported two cases, with another 96 in the surrounding province of Guangdong. Elsewhere, long-distance, inter-provincial bus services had been suspended, including those to and from Beijing. The rapid increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis is getting worse but could reflect better monitoring and reporting of the virus. Those killed by the virus have mostly been middle-aged or elderly people, sometimes suffering from other conditions that weaken their ability to fight back. It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which kills tens of thousands of people every year in the US alone.

"Mayor of China's Wuhan expects another 1,000 virus cases in the city - Times of India","SHANGHAI: The mayor of China's Wuhan, epicentre of an outbreak of a coronavirus that has killed 56 and infected more than 2,000 in China, said on Sunday he expects another 1,000 new patients in the city, highlighting the immense pressure on Wuhan's infrastructure. Wuhan's city government will step up construction of specialised hospitals to deal with infected patients, Zhou Xianwang told reporters. The pressure on supplies of medical goods such as protective suits, masks and glasses had largely eased, he said, thanks in part to increased private donations. Wuhan, a city of about 11 million and capital of Hubei province, has been under virtual lockdown amid intensifying efforts to contain the outbreak. Images of hospital corridors packed with people seeking treatment have circulated widely on Chinese social media, and residents have complained of soaring prices on essentials such as vegetables.

"With 726 dengue cases, Goa sees three-fold rise in 2019 | Goa News - Times of India","PANAJI: In 2019, Goa registered 726 dengue cases. The number was highest in a decade. There was a steady rise in cases since 2017, but the number saw three-fold increase in 2019. Health department authorities say the exceptional rise in cases in 2019 was due to a spurt in other parts of the country. They feel that the scene in 2020 will not be as bad as last year if precautionary measures are taken ahead of monsoon. “We had more cases last year as there was high incidence of dengue across the country,” said Dr Anant Palekar, in-charge of national vector control programme in Goa. “It is not right to assume that we will have more dengue cases this year as well,” he said, adding, “with proper precautions, spread of dengue virus can be controlled”. Palekar said that post-November 2019, there were a few cases. “There has been sporadic prevalence, mostly in Vasco. We get one or two cases of dengue a week,” he said. Majority of dengue cases, including a death incident, occurred during monsoon. Quite a few cases were also detected in some upmarket areas of Panaji. Dengue mosquitos were found breeding in houses where people keep flower pots. In areas where there is no regular water supply, dengue mosquitoes breed. “We advise people to cover up water storage tanks, especially in those areas where there is irregular water supply and clean those once a week,” he said. Besides, improper disposal of waste can also be a source of dengue spread. “Used plastic cups, coconut shells or items that can hold water could be a source for dengue mosquito breeding. People must keep their surroundings clean,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"35 H1N1 cases in January, state says situation in control | Hyderabad News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: With a drop in temperature, there has been a steady rise in number of swine flu (H1N1) cases in the state. As many as 35 cases have been reported since the beginning of the year, most of them are from the city and its peripheral areas. Officials had sent out prior alerts of a possible outbreak in recent months and expect the number of cases to rise till February. Currently, two patients are undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital while another is being treated at the Chest Hospital. The 35 samples which have tested positive are among 138 samples which tested for the presence of the virus. It is reported the virus may have mutated. However, officials are not raising an alarm as there was no outbreak reported. “Most cases are reported from different areas of the city with many samples being sent from corporate hospitals. With the temperature fluctuation, this had been expected but the numbers are less than what they were during the same period last year. It is possible that a mutation may occur given the two-year trend of change in strain noticed so far,” said a senior official from the state health department. In anticipation of an H1N1 outbreak, the health department had been issuing advisories since last two months.

China virus toll hits 41; Australia reports first four cases - Times of India,"BEIJING: The death toll from China's coronavirus outbreak jumped on Saturday to 41 as the Lunar New Year got off to a gloomy start, with Hong Kong declaring a virus emergency, scrapping celebrations, and restricting links to mainland China. Australia on Saturday confirmed its first four cases, Malaysia confirmed three and France reported Europe's first cases on Friday, as health authorities around the world scrambled to prevent a pandemic. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday declared a virus emergency in the Asian financial hub, with five confirmed cases, immediately halting official visits to mainland China and scrapping official Lunar New Year celebrations. Inbound and outbound flights and high speed rail trips between Hong Kong and Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, would be halted, and schools, now on Lunar New Year holidays, would remain shut until February 17. The territory was also treating 122 people suspected of having the disease. The death toll in China rose to 41 on Saturday from 26 a day earlier and more than 1,300 people have been infected globally with a virus traced to a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Hu Yinghai, deputy director-general of the Civil Affairs Department in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, made an appeal on Saturday for masks and protective suits. Hospitals in the city have made similar pleas. ""We are steadily pushing forward the disease control and prevention ... But right now we are facing an extremely severe public health crisis,"" he told a news briefing. Vehicles carrying emergency supplies and medical staff for Wuhan would be exempted from tolls and given traffic priority, China's transportation ministry said on Saturday. Wuhan said it would ban non-essential vehicles from its downtown starting Sunday to control the spread of the virus, further paralysing a city of 11 million that has been on virtual lockdown since Thursday, with nearly all flights cancelled and checkpoints blocking the main roads leading out of town. Authorities have since imposed transport restrictions on nearly all of Hubei province, which has a population of 59 million. In Australia, three men, aged 53, 43 and 35 in New South Wales were in stable condition after they were confirmed to have the virus after returning from Wuhan earlier this month. A Chinese national in his 50s, who had been in Wuhan, was also in stable condition in a Melbourne hospital after arriving from China on Jan. 19, Victoria Health officials said. State-run China Global Television Network reported in a tweet on Saturday that a doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan, 62-year-old Liang Wudong, had died from the virus. It was not immediately clear if his death was already counted in the official toll of 41, of which 39 were in the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located. U.S. coffee chain Starbucks said on Saturday that it was closing all its outlets in Hubei province for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, following a similar move by McDonald's in five Hubei cities. Protective suitsIn Beijing on Saturday, workers in white protective suits checked temperatures of passengers entering the subway at the central railway station, while some train services in eastern China's Yangtze River Delta region were suspended, the local railway operator said. The number of confirmed cases in China stands at 1,287. The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday it had 63 patients under investigation, with two confirmed cases. While China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after cover-up of the 2002/2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome spread, officials in Wuhan have come in for criticism over their handling of the current outbreak. In rare public dissent, a senior journalist at a Hubei provincial newspaper run by the ruling Communist Party on Friday called for a ""immediate"" change of leadership in Wuhan on the Twitter-like Weibo. The post was later removed. Reinforcements to WuhanThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus an ""emergency in China"" this week but stopped short of declaring it of international concern. Human-to-human transmission has been observed in the virus. China's National Health Commission said it had formed six medical teams totalling 1,230 medical staff to help Wuhan. Hubei province, where authorities are rushing to build a 1,000 bed hospital in six days to treat patients, announced on Saturday that there were 658 patients affected by the virus in treatment, 57 of whom were critically ill. The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing conditions, the WHO said. New year disruptionsAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, though some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings. There are fears the transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which began on Saturday, although many have cancelled their plans, with airlines and railways in China providing free refunds. The virus outbreak and efforts to contain it have put a dampener on what is ordinarily a festive time of year. Sanya, a popular resort destination on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, announced that it was shutting all tourist sites, while the island's capital city, Haikou, said visitors from Wuhan would be placed under 14-day quarantine in a hotel. Shanghai Disneyland was closed from Saturday. The theme park has a 100,000 daily capacity and sold out during last year's Lunar New Year holiday.

Coronavirus: All you need to know about symptoms and risksOn Wall Street, stocks slumped amid fears over the widening crisis, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 170 points and the S&P 500 posting its worst day in three months. Health care companies suffered losses, along with financial institutions, airlines and other tourism and travel industry businesses. Transportation was shut down in Wuhan, the city of 11 million where the outbreak originated, and in at least 12 other cities in central China's Hubei province, encompassing a population bigger than that of New York, London, Paris and Moscow combined. Hospitals in Wuhan grappled with a flood of patients and a lack of supplies. Videos circulating online showed throngs of frantic people in masks lined up for examinations, and some complained that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity. Authorities in Wuhan and elsewhere put out calls for medicine, disinfection equipment, masks, goggles, gowns and other protective gear. Wuhan officials said they are rapidly constructing a new hospital to deal with the crisis, to be completed Feb. 3. It will be modeled on a SARS hospital that was built in Beijing in just six days during the SARS outbreak. The seriousness of the crisis was still an open question. The new virus comes from a large family of what are known as coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. But it is not clear just how lethal this coronavirus is, or even whether it is as dangerous as ordinary flu, which kills tens of thousands of people every year in the US alone. Scientists say it is also not clear if it spreads as easily as SARS, its genetic cousin, which also originated in China and killed about 800 people in 2002-03. The rapid increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis is getting worse. It could instead reflect better monitoring and reporting of the newly discovered virus, which can cause cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever and shortness of breath, but can worsen to pneumonia. ""It's still too early to draw conclusions about how severe the virus is because at the beginning of any outbreak you would focus more on the severe cases,"" said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva. ""And then maybe we are missing some mild cases because people will just be a little bit sick and will not have it tested. And they will recover."" In France, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said that two infected patients had traveled in China and that France should brace for more such cases. A third case was announced in a statement from her ministry about three hours later. ""We see how difficult it is in today's world to close the frontiers. In reality, it's not possible,"" she said. Buzyn said authorities are seeking to reach anyone who might have come in contact with the patients: ""It's important to control the fire as quickly as possible."" In the US, the latest person confirmed to have the disease was reported to be doing well. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention likewise said it is expecting more Americans to be diagnosed with the virus. Still, ""CDC believes that the immediate risk to the American public continues to be low at this time, but the situation continues to evolve rapidly,"" said the agency's Dr. Nancy Messonnier. With Chinese authorities afraid that public gatherings will hasten the spread of the virus, the outbreak put a damper on Lunar New Year. Temples locked their doors, Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland and other major tourist destinations closed, and people canceled restaurant reservations ahead of the holiday, normally a time of family reunions, sightseeing trips, fireworks displays and other festivities in the country of 1.4 billion people. Wuhan's usually bustling streets, malls and other public spaces were unnervingly quiet and masks were mandatory in public. Shoppers emptied store shelves, stocking up for what could be an extended period of isolation. Karaoke bars, movie theaters and internet cafes around the region were shut down. While most of the deaths have been older patients, a 36-year-old man in Hubei died on Thursday. The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or involved people who visited the city or had personal connections to those infected. About two dozen cases in all have been confirmed outside mainland China, nearly all of them in Asia: Hong Kong, Macao, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam and Nepal. Recalling the government's initial cover-up of SARS, many Chinese are suspicious of the case numbers reported by officials. Authorities have promised transparency. China's cabinet, the State Council, announced it will be collecting information on government departments that have failed in their response to the outbreak, including ""delays, concealment and under-reporting of the epidemic.""

"China orders nationwide measures to detect virus on flights, trains, buses - Times of India","BEIJING: China has ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses, as the death toll and number of patients has skyrocketed. Inspection stations will be set up and passengers with suspected pneumonia must be ""immediately transported"" to a medical centre, the National Health Commission said in a statement. The isolation of suspected cases must be followed by disinfection of the train, plane or bus. The statement said ""all departments of transportation"" must ""strictly"" introduce prevention and control measures including screening measures in airports, railway stations, bus stations and ports. The measures apply across all transportation routes as well as at customs and border inspections. Staff serving passengers must all wear masks, the NHC said. The travel authority must also provide details about those in close contact with the suspected infection case, such as those sitting in the same carriage. The order applies across all provinces and regions. All areas should formulate ""emergency response plans"" to the outbreak including training medical staff. The announcement came as the death toll jumped to 41 and the number of cases reached almost 1,300. In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, the Chinese army deployed 450 medical specialists to overwhelmed hospitals. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
Coronavirus: Government steps up screening at Tamil Nadu airports | Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: All passengers arriving at airports in the state will be screened for influenza-like symptoms to pick possible cases of new coronavirus identified in China. Health minister C Vijayabaskar said the state was working to prevent cross-border spread of the new strain and has strengthened health infrastructure and resources to handle emergencies. ""We will be doing a routine thermal screening of passengers arriving at our airports. Medical teams are stationed at the airports to help passengers,"" he said. Warning signs for the new strain, like other influenza viruses, include fever, cough and breathing difficulties, while more advanced cases could lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and death. The state has sent available educational material about the virus to doctors' bodies to ensure they identify cases early. Tests for the new virus will be sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) lab, officials said. The new strain of coronavirus belongs to the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). ""We are told that as of now it has been detected in Wuhan in China. We are being cautious, aware and practising usual precautions. There is no panic as of now,"" said state health secretary Beela Rajesh. Director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy said although screening is being done by authorities at airports, better benefits have been seen when people with a respiratory illnesses seek medical attention and share travel history with doctors. ""Outbreaks of SARS, H1N1 and other such epidemics have seen better outcomes when people seek treatment,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"President Xi warns virus spreading fast, China facing ‘grave situation’ - Times of India","BEIJING: President Xi Jinping said China was facing a “grave situation” as the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped to 41, overshadowing celebrations of the Lunar New Year that began on Saturday. China also announced further transport restrictions. With more than 1,400 people infected worldwide, most of them in China, Hong Kong declared a virus emergency, scrapped celebrations and restricted links to mainland China. Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday, Malaysia confirmed four and France reported Europe’s first cases on Friday, as health authorities around the world scrambled to prevent a pandemic. In Hong Kong, with five confirmed cases, the city’s leader Carrie Lam said flights and high speed rail trips between the city and Wuhan will be halted. Schools in Hong Kong that are currently on Lunar New Year holidays will remain closed until February 17. Xi held a politburo meeting on Saturday on measures to fight the “accelerating” outbreak, state television reported. The death toll in China has risen to 41, authorities reported on Saturday, up from 26 a day earlier. As of 6pm local time, 1,372 people in China had been infected with the virus — traced to a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and US. In Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, officials appealed for masks and protective suits. “We are steadily pushing forward the disease control and prevention ... But right now we are facing an extremely severe public health crisis,” Hu Yinghai, deputy director-general of the civil affairs department, said. Ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing said it was halting inter-city services to and from Beijing from Sunday, while the capital will also stop running inter-province shuttle buses. State broadcaster CCTV, citing an announcement from China's tourism industry association, said the country would halt all group tours, both at home and abroad, from Monday. Wuhan said it would ban non-essential vehicles from its downtown starting Sunday, further paralysing a city of 11 million that has been on virtual lockdown since Thursday, with nearly all flights cancelled and checkpoints blocking the main roads leading out of town. Authorities have since imposed transport restrictions on nearly all of Hubei province, which has a population of 59 million. Australia confirmed its first four cases in two different cities on Saturday, and the country’s chief health official said he expected more cases as Australia is a popular destination for Chinese tourists. State-run China Global Television Network reported on Saturday that a doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan, 62-year-old Liang Wudong, had died from the virus. US coffee chain Starbucks said it was closing all its outlets in Hubei province for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, following a similar move by McDonald’s in five Hubei cities. Workers in white protective suits checked temperatures of passengers entering the subway at Beijing’s central railway station on Saturday, while some train services in the eastern Yangtze River Delta region were suspended, the local railway operator said. There are fears transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the Lunar New Year holiday, although many have cancelled their plans. Shanghai Disneyland was closed from Saturday. Beijing’s Lama Temple, where people make offerings for the new year, has also closed, as have some other temples. The WHO this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency. A report by infectious disease specialists at Imperial College, London on Saturday said that despite this, the epidemic “represents a clear and ongoing global health threat"" adding: “It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China”.

"China shuts transport, temples, Great Wall as virus toll hits 26 - Times of India","Authorities on Friday greatly expanded a travel lockdown in China by suspending transport in 10 cities, including the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak, effectively penning in at least 30 million residents in an effort to contain the virus. The new limits — abruptly decreed before the Lunar New Year holiday, China’s busiest travel season — were an extraordinary step that underlined the governing Communist Party’s deepening fears about the outbreak of a little-understood coronavirus. Just one day after China restricted travel in and from the centre of the outbreak, Wuhan, a city of 11million and the capital of Hubei province, and four nearby towns, the government announced plans to suspend public transportation services covering more than half the population of the province. The rapidly expanding outbreak has overwhelmed the province’s hospitals and fuelled fears of a global pandemic. Health officials reported on Friday that the new strain of a coronavirus has killed 26 people and affected 1,100 in various countries. On Thursday, authorities imposed a travel lockdown in Wuhan, and airlines cancelled hundreds of flights to the city, leaving thousands stranded. Later in the day, officials said they would also halt public transportation in the nearby cities of Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang and Chibi. By Friday, restrictions had been announced in five other cities. Several said the Lunar New Year on Saturday would pass without the usual celebrations or vacation travel. Residents said that the city was now also confronting food supply problems because so many shops and markets had closed. “We won’t have a new year celebration tonight. There’s no feeling for it, and no food,” said Wu Qiang, a resident in his 50s who was waiting outside the hospital entrance for word about his son. The majority of the deaths have occurred in Hubei province but two deaths have been confirmed outside the centre of the outbreak. The disease has also been detected in Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the US, in travellers who had visited China. A Chicago woman became the second US patient to be diagnosed with the new virus, health officials announced on Friday. The woman in her 60s returned from China on Jauary 13. Earlier this week, a man in Washington state was diagnosed with the virus after returning from a trip to China. A Texas student may have be infected, US health officials said. The Texas A&M University student is in isolation at home. In Britain, nine people were awaiting results on whether they have contracted the coronavirus; 14 people total have been tested for the disease, with five given the all clear. Meanwhile, Shanghai Disneyland, one of the biggest tourist attractions in China, will shut down on Saturday as Chinese authorities look for ways to reduce crowds to stop the spread of the virus. Also, authorities operating the Badaling section of the Great Wall of China, a popular tourist destination north of Beijing, said it would temporarily close beginning Saturday.

"France confirms 3 cases of virus from China, 1st in Europe - Times of India","PARIS (AP) — France on Friday announced three confirmed cases of the deadly new virus from China, the first outside Asia and the United States. Authorities said all three sickened people had traveled to China. Two of them belonged to the same family. They were the first cases registered in Europe.Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said she expects more cases and that the virus must be battled like a wildfire. She said the likely reason that France has the first European cases is that it quickly developed a test allowing medics to rapidly diagnose the sickened. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.France on Friday announced the first cases outside Asia and the United States of the deadly new virus from China, and the country's health minister said Europe should brace for other new cases from the spreading epidemic that she said must be fought like a wildfire. Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said the two confirmed cases, Europe's first, both involved people who had traveled to China, where hundreds of people have fallen ill and more than two dozen have died. The sickened patients in France were quickly hospitalized, in isolation, one in Paris, the other in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.In part because of Europe's open borders, the minister said she expects more cases.“We see how difficult it is in today's world to close the frontiers. In reality, it's not possible,” she said.“We have two cases,” she added. “We will probably have other cases.”Buzyn said speed in diagnosing new cases will be essential in slowing the spread of the virus. She said the likely reason that France has the first European cases is that it quickly developed a test allowing medics to rapidly diagnose the sickened.“You have to treat an epidemic as you would a fire, that's to say find the source very quickly,” she said. “We identified the first positive cases very quickly.""One of people sickened, a 48-year-old man, passed through Wuhan, the epicenter in China for the virus, before traveling to France on Wednesday, the minister said. He has been hospitalized in Bordeaux since Thursday. She said he is a French national who traveled to China for work and who lives in the Bordeaux area.The other person is hospitalized in a large city hospital in Paris. The minister said that person also traveled to China but that she had little other information about that case because it was only confirmed just minutes before she spoke at a hastily called evening news conference.The Bordeaux patient was in contact with about 10 people before he was taken into care, the minister said. French authorities are seeking to contact them.The minister urged people who suspect they've sickened to call emergency services and to stay at home to avoid spreading the virus. She said those who came into contact with the two sickened patients would be told likewise.“It's important to control the fire as quickly as possible. Hence the need to piece together patient histories and to find people who were in contact with the patient,” she said. “We will do everything possible to confine this epidemic,"" she pledged. The French minister promised “total transparency” as the country battles the outbreak and said her ministry would give daily news updates “so there is no false information on social networks.”She said informing the public is “the most effective barrier"" against the spread of the virus, more so than taking people's temperatures as they arrive at airports and other entry points to test if they have a fever. Such tests are easily fooled and provide a false sense of security, she said.“People only need to take aspirin 15 minutes before landing to no longer have a fever,” she said. The number of confirmed cases around the world has climbed sharply to more than 850, the bulk of them in China. There have been at least 25 deaths, all of them in China.The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or involved people who visited the city or had personal connections to those infected. Fewer than two dozen cases in all have been confirmed outside mainland China, in Hong Kong, Macao, the U.S., South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam.The U.S. reported its second case, involving a Chicago woman in her 60s who was hospitalized after returning from China.

No Mickey Mouse parade as Shanghai Disney shuts to prevent spread of virus - Times of India,"WUHAN: China stepped up measures to contain a virus that has killed 25 people and infected more than 800, with public transport suspended in 10 cities, the shutting of temples and the rapid construction of a hospital to treat the infected. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday declared the new coronavirus an emergency for China but stopped short of declaring the epidemic of international concern. Health authorities fear the infection rate could accelerate over the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel to their homes and abroad during week-long holidays, which began on Friday. Shanghai Disneyland will close from Saturday over fears the virus could run rife over the peak holiday period. At the railway station in Wuhan, where the virus emerged last month, the few passengers who took the risk of returning home to the city at the epicentre of the crisis put on a brave face. ""What choice do I have? It’s Chinese New Year. We have to see our family,” said one arriving traveller named Hu. As of Thursday, there were 830 confirmed cases and 25 people had died, the National Health Commission. Most cases are in the central city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife. Preliminary research suggested that in the most recent stage of its evolution, the Wuhan virus crossed to humans from snakes. Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and neighbouring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million, were in virtual lockdown. Rail stations were largely shut, with few trains stopping, flights suspended and checkpoints on main roads in and out. About 10 people got off a high-speed train that pulled into Wuhan on Friday afternoon but nobody boarded before it resumed its journey. ""I’m not afraid. I trust the government. I need to be with my family,"" said a passenger, dragging two large cases out of the station. He declined to give his name. Wuhan was building a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat those infected, with the aim of having it ready by Monday, the official Changjiang Daily reported. The prefabricated buildings were being erected around a holiday complex originally intended for workers, set in gardens by a lake on the outskirts of the city. Television footage showed about 30 mechanical diggers clawing at brown earth as they prepared the site. Wuhan hospitals called for donations of protective equipment such as masks and suits, as supplies ran low and the number of cases grew. Non-fatal cases have also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States, prompting several airlines to suspend flights to and from Wuhan. Airports worldwide have stepped up the screening of passengers from China. CHINA EMERGENCY, NOT GLOBAL The WHO said on Thursday it was a ""bit too early"" to consider the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, a designation requiring countries to step up their response. ""Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""It has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one."" The previously unknown virus, which has no cure and can spread through respiratory transmission, has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Frustration with the government response appeared to be growing in Wuhan with some fearing it was too late. ""In the very beginning, they didn't take action and hardly offered any information to the public,"" a 30-year-old Wuhan resident, who declined to provide her name, told Reuters. ""Clearly it's too late."" Three research teams are to start work on vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said. The plan is to have at least one in clinical trials by June. Some experts believe the virus is not as dangerous as the one that caused the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which also began in China and killed nearly 800 people, or the one that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which has killed more than 700 people since 2012. TEMPLES, FORBIDDEN CITY, RAIL STATIONS SHUT Chinese authorities have advised people to avoid crowds and 10 cities in the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located, have suspended some transport over the outbreak, the Hubei Daily reported. In Zhijiang city, all public venues have been shut except hospitals, some markets, petrol stations and drug stores, the paper reported. Some famous temples have closed due to virus. Beijing's Lama Temple, where people make offerings for the new year, will close from Friday. Beijing also cancelled two Lunar New Year temple fairs, and closed the Forbidden City, the capital's most famous tourist attraction. Shanghai Disneyland will close from Saturday. The theme park has a 100,000 daily capacity and sold out during last year's Lunar New Year holiday. The virus is expected to dent China's growth after months of economic worries over trade tensions with the United States. A National Australia Bank research team estimated China's gross domestic product growth for the first quarter could be hit by about 1 percentage point.

Up to 70 percent chance of Chinese virus reaching Europe: Analysis - Times of India,"PARIS: There is up to a 70 percent chance of a patient carrying the deadly coronavirus that originated in China arriving in Europe, according to calculations released Friday by French researchers. The National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) analysed flight paths between Europe and China, where hundreds of people have contracted the previously unseen virus. The outbreak has killed 26 people after appearing first at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, a key international transit hub. Although Chinese authorities have moved swiftly to quarantine 13 cities, cases have already been confirmed in South Korea, Japan, Thailand and the United States. Iserm concluded that there was a 33-70 percent risk of a patient arriving in Europe by air. ""Given air traffic patterns, the countries most exposed are Germany and Britain,"" it said in a statement.

During a news conference in Geneva, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that while the epidemic was clearly a crisis in China, “it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.”The steps taken by China to shut down cities with more than 18 million people are unprecedented in public health, as countries typically shy away from such extreme measures. Tedros said that while WHO's role is to provide science-based recommendations, “at the end of the day, a sovereign country has the autonomy to do what it thinks is right.” However, he added that WHO hoped the actions taken by China would be “short in duration.” The decision not to declare a global emergency “should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we’re not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth,” Tedros said. “WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.”The United Nations health agency made the decision after independent experts spent two days assessing information about the spread of the newly identified coronavirus.“It’s too early to consider this as a public health emergency of international concern,” Didier Houssin, the chair of the emergency advisory committee, said, noting that the panel “was very divided, almost 50-50.”WHO defines a global emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas, the swine flu pandemic, and polio. A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous foreign governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. Deciding whether an outbreak amounts to an international crisis therefore can also be politically fraught. In 2014, WHO resisted declaring the devastating Ebola epidemic in West Africa to be a global emergency because it feared the announcement would anger Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. During a news conference in Geneva, Houssin suggested that China's view of the outbreak was a factor in Thursday's decision. “The perception of this declaration by the international community, in the most affected country, by the people struggling with the virus, certainly has to be considered,” he said. Hundreds of people infected with the new virus have fallen ill in China, and 17 have died. The first cases appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China.Other cases have been reported in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore, Vietnam and Hong Kong reported their first cases Thursday. While airports in many major cities around the world have instituted health screenings for arriving passengers from China, Tedros said that “for the moment, WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade.”Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that regardless of the decision not to declare an emergency, many more resources were needed to stop the virus. “There are still many missing pieces in the jigsaw puzzle to fully understanding this new virus, which is spreading rapidly across China and most probably around the world,” Piot said in a statement. “There cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action.”This story has not been edited by The Times of India and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News.(This story has not been edited by timesofindia.com and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.)"
World airports taking precautions after China virus ourbreak - Times of India,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Airports around the world have begun taking precautions to deal with an anticipated influx of Chinese tourists taking Lunar New Year holidays, just as the outbreak of a pneumonia-like virus in China has prompted officials there to take drastic measures to prevent its spread.Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, announced on Thursday that, following government guidance, all passengers arriving on direct flights from China will receive thermal screening at the gate upon arrival and be provided with informational brochures. The screening will be conducted at secured, closed gates by teams from the Dubai Health Authority and the Airport Medical Center, Dubai Airports said in a statement provided to The Associated Press.The airport authority would not say whether it expected a drop in passengers from China for the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins Friday, following China's decision to close off Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, where a newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month. Chinese are expected to take an estimated 3 billion trips during the 40-day spike in travel.China shut down train stations, the airport, subways, ferries and long-distance shuttle buses in the city, and local authorities have demanded all residents wear masks in public places.At dawn on Thursday, Italian Red Cross officials were on hand at Rome's Fiumicino airport to meet the last flight from Wuhan before the Chinese city's airport was shut down. The 202 passengers were taken to a special sterile area for a screening of their body temperature by health workers wearing sanitary suits, goggles and masks, but none were found to be suffering from the virus, Dr. Michele Bonizzi said.“The passengers passed through this structure where, if there had been — and that was not the case today — a need to do further tests our ambulance was there” to take them to a hospital, she said. Before flights from Wuhan were grounded, passengers arriving in the U.S. from flights originating in the city were directed to Kennedy Airport in New York, Los Angeles International, San Francisco International, O'Hare Airport in Chicago and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport where facilities were set up for screening. British authorities said passengers arriving from China to Heathrow Airport in London, Europe's busiest, and other airports were not being screened but that they were being given information leaflets on what to do if they fall ill. Germany's Fraport, the operator of Frankfurt Airport, said it had not yet received any government guidance advising screening take place so there are currently no travel restrictions.In China, measures similar to the lockdown in Wuhan were being taken at nearby cities in Hubei province, with public transport suspended and theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment centers closed beginning Friday, according to state media reports. The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-2003 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, which developed from camels.So far, most of China's 571 cases have been in Wuhan and a total of 17 people have died, all of them in and around the city.The Lunar New Year is one of the world's largest annual movement of people, and previously Dubai Airports said it was “preparing to welcome thousands of Chinese travelers” ahead of the weekend.Preliminary figures show Dubai Airport welcomed some 3.7 million passengers from China, a 5% increase year-on-year. _____Associated Press writers David Koenig in Dallas, Jill Lawless in London, and Tricia Thomas in Rome contributed to this story.

Hong Kong turns holiday camps into quarantine zones as virus fears spike - Times of India,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong will turn two holiday camps, including a former military barracks, into quarantine zones for people who may have come into contact with carriers of the Wuhan virus, officials announced Thursday. The international financial hub has been on high alert for the virus, which has killed 17 people since the outbreak started in central China. The same sites were used as quarantine facilities during the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. Nearly 300 people in Hong Kong were killed by SARS, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. So far two people in the city have tested positive for the new coronavirus -- which is similar to the SARS pathogen. Both had visited Wuhan in recent days. They are being treated on isolation wards in hospital. The gambling hub of Macau, which is hugely popular with mainland tourists, also confirmed two cases this week. On Thursday, Macau's tourism bureau announced it was cancelling all official Lunar New Year celebrations in response. In Hong Kong, officials announced they would convert two holiday parks to isolate any potential cases while they await test results. ""We will have a full team of staff to operate the quarantine camps,"" Wong Ka-hing, the director of the Centre for Health Protection, told reporters. Wong said three people who had come into close contact with the two confirmed cases would be taken to a camp in rural Sai Kung district later Thursday. Another holiday camp, a former British military barracks on Hong Kong island, was being prepared to serve as a quarantine facility. The three people are the wife of one of the confirmed cases and two medical staff, health officials said. Those who test positive for the Wuhan virus will then be treated in isolation wards at the city's hospitals, but the holiday camp quarantine zones will lower the risk of the virus spreading while people await results. The same system was used during the SARS outbreak, which dramatically transformed Hong Kong into a place where the population is now far more conscious of contagion and hygiene standards. Door handles, elevator buttons and escalator handles in the city's myriad skyscrapers and metro stations are routinely sterilised multiple times a day, while an unguarded sneeze on the crowded subway can cause neighbouring commuters to scramble for distance. Surgical face masks are ubiquitous, not just in the winter flu season, with many shops selling out in recent days. Hong Kong's difficulties in battling SARS were compounded by the veil of secrecy that surrounded the outbreak on the authoritarian mainland. But officials insist they are more prepared than 2003 and say Chinese authorities are being much more transparent with data. Nonetheless, suspicion of the mainland remains high in Hong Kong, especially as it convulses with anti-government protests sparked by fears Beijing is eroding the city's unique freedoms. On Thursday, health officials were questioned by reporters as to why they weren't advising all arrivals at the city's high-speed train link with the mainland to fill out health declaration forms. ""We are now actively considering to extend the compulsory health declaration to cover the high-speed rail link,"" Wong said. He added that any decision to cancel Lunar New Year celebrations like Macau has would need to be taken by the government. Officials have also been criticised by opposition lawmakers for allowing relatives of the first confirmed case to travel on to Manila. Hospital Authority Director Chung Kin-lai said around half of the roughly 500 beds available in isolation wards within Hong Kong's hospitals were currently occupied by patients with various illnesses. ""We have planned to cut some non-urgent services after the Lunar New Year in order to guarantee supply for places,"" she told reporters. She added that extra emergency clinics could also be opened within 48 hours if a major epidemic broke out. Hong Kong's train operator MTR Corporation also said it was no longer selling tickets to Wuhan, which has been placed under lockdown by Chinese authorities. Cathay Pacific said it would stop flights to the city until February 29. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."

"Early start to H1N1 season, 40-year old Satara man dies in Pune | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: It is still too soon to know how severe this season will be, but swine flu claimed its first victim in the city and the state this year on January 10. The 40-year-old man from the rural parts of Satara died after he tested positive for the contagion at KEM Hospital in Rasta Peth. It is still too soon to know how severe this season will be, but swine flu claimed its first victim in the city and the state this year on January 10Currently, a 64-year-old woman of Sangvi in Pune is critical and undergoing treatment at the intensive care unit of Sahyadri Hospital in the city. As many as six patients from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane and Pune have tested positive for the virus in Maharashtra between January 1 and January 13, this year. Symptoms of swine flu are similar to a common cold and people often take it lightly in the initial stages till it turns critical. In 2019, as many as 2,287 people in the state were diagnosed with the H1N1 infection. Of them, 246 people succumbed to the contagion, accounting for a significant mortality rate of 10% calling for vigilance and also initiation of early treatment for influenza-like illness, say experts. “Scientists at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) confirmed the presence of H1N1 virus in the man's throat swab on January 2. He succumbed to swine flu-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with septicemia around 5.50am on January 10. He was diabetic,” a doctor from the KEM Hospital said. The deceased man was from Nirgudi village in Phaltan taluka of Satara district. He had developed influenza-like illness from December 24. “Initially, he had fever and cough. Later, he developed high grade fever with breathlessness. He was admitted to KEM hospital in Rasta Peth on December 28. Despite medication, the man's condition kept worsening. He was also kept on ventilator support during the course of treatment,” the doctor said. Experts say that since the symptoms of swine flu are quite similar to common cold, people often don’t take it seriously in the initial stages until it becomes critical. “A swine flu patient usually suffers from a burning sore throat, abdominal pain and cough and the additional symptom of shortness of breath. These symptoms should not be dismissed and need to be treated under the supervision of a medical expert,” infectious diseases expert Mahesh Lakhe of Columbia Asia Hospital in Kharadi said. He recommended a quadriplegic flu vaccine shot before the flu season peaks, especially for those suffering from underlying medical conditions.

Washington man is 1st in US to catch new virus from China - Times of India,"SEATTLE (AP) — The U.S. on Tuesday reported its first case of a new and potentially deadly virus circulating in China, saying a Washington state resident who returned last week from the outbreak's epicenter was hospitalized near Seattle.The man, identified only as a Snohomish County resident is in his 30s, was in good condition and wasn't considered a threat to medical staff or the public, health officials said.U.S. health officials stressed that they believe the virus' overall risk to the American public remained low. The newly discovered virus has infected about 300 people, all of whom had been in China, and killed six. The virus can cause coughing, fever, breathing difficulty and pneumonia. The U.S. joins a growing list of places outside mainland China reporting cases, following Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.Airports around the world have stepped up monitoring, checking passengers from China for signs of illness in hopes of containing the virus during the busy Lunar New Year travel season.Late last week, U.S. health officials began screening passengers from Wuhan in central China, where the outbreak began. The screening had been underway at three U.S. airports — New York City's Kennedy airport and the Los Angeles and San Francisco airports. On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it would add Chicago's O'Hare airport and Atlanta's airport to the mix later this week.What's more, officials will begin forcing all passengers from Wuhan to go to one of those five airports if they wish to enter the U.S.The U.S. resident had no symptoms when he arrived at the Seattle-Tacoma airport last Wednesday, but he contacted doctors on Sunday when he started feeling ill, officials said. Lab testing on Monday confirmed he had the virus, “The gentleman right now is very healthy,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the CDC.The hospital, Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, said in a statement that it expected the man would be monitored there at least until Thursday.CDC officials said they sent a team to Washington to try to track down people who might have come in contact with the man. The hospital also said it was contacting “the small number of staff and patients” who may have been with the man at a clinic.Health officials described the number of possible contacts since he got back to the U.S. as small.Last month, doctors began seeing the new virus in people who got sick after spending time at a food market in Wuhan. More than 275 cases of the newly identified virus have been confirmed in China, most of them in Wuhan, according to the World Health Organization.The count includes six deaths — all in China, most of them age 60 or older, including at least some who had a previous medical condition.Officials have said it probably spread from animals to people, but this week Chinese officials said they've concluded it also can spread from person to person.Health authorities this month identified the germ behind the outbreak as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold; others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS — Middle East respiratory syndrome — as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.The new virus so far does not appear to be as deadly as SARS and MERS, but viruses can sometimes mutate to become more dangerous.University of Washington coronavirus researcher David Veesler said the public “should not be panicking right now.”The response has been “very efficient,” Veesler said. “In a couple of weeks, China was able to identify the virus, isolate it, sequence it and share that information.”Veesler added: “We don’t have enough data to judge how severe the disease is.” The CDC's Messonnier said health officials expected to see more cases in the U.S. and around the world in the coming days.___Stobbe reported from New York.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Coronavirus infection: US confirms first case of China virus on American soil | World News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: US health authorities on Tuesday announced the first case of a person on American soil sickened by a new virus that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, and intensified airport health screenings. The man, a US resident in his 30s who lives near Seattle, is in good condition, according to federal and state officials. The man is being ""hospitalised out of an abundance of precaution, and for short term monitoring, not because there was severe illness,"" said Chris Spitters, a Washington state health official. The news came as Asian countries ramped up measures to block the spread of the new virus as the death toll in China rose to six and the number of cases surpassed 300. China is about to embark on the Lunar New Year holiday -- a huge travel time for hundreds of millions of people. The man hospitalised in Washington state had travelled to the US from Wuhan, but did not visit the seafood market thought to be at the heart of the outbreak. He entered the US on January 15 - two days before health screenings for those travelling from Wuhan began at airports in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco - and approached health authorities himself after reading news reports about the virus. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will now be deployed to two additional international airports, in Chicago and Atlanta. All travellers on flights from Wuhan, either direct or connecting, will now be re-routed to the five airports with screening systems in place. Nations across the Asia-Pacific region stepped up checks of passengers at airports to detect the SARS-like coronavirus. Fears of a bigger outbreak rose after a prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed late Monday that the virus can be passed between people.

"China virus outbreak may wallop economy, financial markets - Times of India","BANGKOK: News that a new virus that has afflicted hundreds of people in central China can spread between humans has rattled financial markets and raised concern it might wallop the economy just as it might be regaining momentum. Health authorities across Asia have been stepping up surveillance and other precautions to prevent a repeat of the disruptions and deaths during the 2003 SARS crisis, which caused $40 billion-$50 billion in losses from reduced travel and spending. The first cases of what has been identified as a novel coronavirus were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting animal-to-human transmission, but it now is also thought to be spread between people. As of Wednesday, some 440 people were confirmed infected and nine had died from the illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms. A retreat in financial markets on Tuesday was followed by a rebound on Wednesday, as investors snapped up bargains. Share benchmarks were mostly higher, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng gaining 1.1% and the Shanghai Composite index advancing 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 0.7%. While the new virus appears much less dangerous than SARS, “the most significant Asia risk could lie ahead as the regional peak travel season takes hold, which could multiply the disease diffusion,"" said Stephen Innes, chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp. “So, while the risk is returning to the market, the lights might not turn green until we move through the Lunar New Year travel season to better gauge the coronavirus dispersion."" The 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in China, along with cases of a deadly form of bird flu, resulted in widespread quarantine measures in many Chinese cities and in Hong Kong. More than 8,000 people fell sick and just under 800 people died, a mortality rate of under 10%. While the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, such new diseases raise alarm due to the uncertainties over how deadly they might be and how they might spread. That's especially true during the annual mass travel of the Lunar New Year festival, which begins this week. “The cost to the global economy can be quite staggering in negative GDP terms if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,"" Innes said in a report. In China, health officials stepped up screening for fevers. “We ask the public to avoid crowds and minimize the public gatherings to reduce the possibility of cross infection,"" Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Commission, said Wednesday. Just as with SARS, though, the impact of the disease is likely to fall heaviest on specific industries, such as hotels and airlines, railways, casinos and other leisure businesses and retailers, analysts said. Most declined Tuesday but rebounded on Wednesday as investors locked in profits ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. The outbreak is a boon, meanwhile, for pharmaceutical companies and makers of protective masks and other medical gear. “If the pneumonia couldn't be contained in the short term, we expect China's retail sales, tourism, hotel & catering, travel activities likely to be hit, especially in the first and second quarters,"" said Ning Zhang of UBS. Government efforts to offset the shock would help, but growth will likely rebound less than earlier forecast, Zhang said. As of Jan. 17, the World Health Organization had not recommended any international restrictions on travel but urged local authorities to work with the travel industry to help prevent the disease from spreading while warning travelers who fall ill to seek medical attention. The illness is yet another blow for Hong Kong, whose economy is reeling from months of often violent anti-government protests. The wider concern is China, where the economy grew at a 30-year low 6.1% annual pace in 2019. An interim trade pact between Beijing and Washington had raised hopes that some pressure from tensions between the two biggest economies might ease, and the latest data have showed signs of improved demand for exports. The virus outbreak raises the risk such optimism might be premature. “According to our analysis of the spread of the SARS virus, which so far appears very similar to 2019-nCoV (the new virus), we expect increased downward pressure on China's growth, particularly in the services sector,"" Ting Lu and other analysts at Nomura in Hong Kong said in a commentary.

China: Mystery virus claims sixth victim as holiday travel stokes risk - Times of India,"BEIJING: The death toll from a mysterious flu-like virus in China climbed to six on Tuesday as new cases surged beyond 300 and authorities fretted about the added risk from millions of Chinese travelling for the Lunar New Year holiday. Round the world, airports tightened screening of travellers from China as officials confirmed the coronavirus strain is contagious between humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) called a meeting for Wednesday to consider declaring a global health emergency. The outbreak, which began in the central city of Wuhan, also sent shivers through financial markets as investors recalled the fallout from China's Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002/2003 that it initially covered up. The SARS coronavirus killed nearly 800 people then. ""We'll stay at home during the holiday. I'm scared as I remember SARS very well,"" said Zhang Xinyuan, who had been bound from Beijing for the Thai resort of Phuket before she and her husband decided to cancel their air tickets. Authorities have confirmed more than 300 cases in China, mostly in Wuhan, a provincial capital and transportation hub, where the virus may have originated at a sea food market. There have been six deaths in that city, Mayor Zhou Xianwang told Chinese state television on Tuesday. The virus has been spreading around other parts of China, however, including five cases in the national capital Beijing. Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected. Abroad, Thailand has reported two cases and South Korea one, all involving Chinese travellers from Wuhan. Japan and Taiwan also confirmed one case each, both nationals who had been to Wuhan. ""Information about newly reported infections suggest there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission,"" said WHO's regional director for the western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai. Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its own, on Monday set up an epidemic response command centre. More than 1,000 beds were prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further. MARKET WOBBLEThe mounting anxiety was transmitted to regional markets. China's onshore yuan fell 0.6%, its biggest daily drop since Aug. 26, 2019, while airline and travel stocks fell across the region. European shares also slipped on concerns about the impact of the outbreak, with luxury goods firms particularly hard-hit on worries about weaker demand from Chinese consumers. Though the origin of the virus was yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan's seafood market. The virus can cause pneumonia, with symptoms including fever and difficulty in breathing. As those symptoms are similar to many other respiratory diseases, extra screening is needed. ""The outbreak of a SARS-like coronavirus in Wuhan is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region now that there is medical evidence of human-to-human transmission,"" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific Chief Economist for IHS Markit. So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions but such measures could be discussed at Wednesday's meeting. China's National Health Commission will also give an update at a press briefing at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Wednesday. RUSH FOR MASKSAirports in the United States, Australia and across Asia have begun screening passengers from Wuhan. In the city itself, officials have been using infrared thermometers to screen passengers at airports, railway stations and other passenger terminals since Jan. 14. The Lunar New Year is a major holiday for Chinese, many of whom travel to join family or have a foreign holiday. Images of long lines of people queuing to buy face masks were circulating widely on Chinese social media. Some online vendors were limiting sales of masks and hand sanitizers as demand surged. Shanghai city's market regulator warned it would punish speculators hoarding masks or other products used for preventing diseases, according to the Shanghai Observer, a web publication backed by a Communist Party newspaper. But Zhong Nanshan, head of the National Health Commission's team investigating the outbreak, sought to ease alarm, saying in footage shown by state television there was no danger of a repeat of the SARS epidemic so long as precautions were taken. Chinese travel booking platforms from Trip.com to Alibaba Group's Fliggy said they would offer free cancellations on bookings made for Wuhan.

Coronavirus explained: What you need to know about China's deadly virus - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The coronavirus (CoV) is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed four people in China is a novel strain not seen before. Common symptoms of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) strain, which has infected more than 300 people since the outbreak in Wuhan in December, include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. According to the WHO, the CoV is a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). ""Initial available data indicates that the novel Coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV) appears to cause less mortality than SARS CoV and MERS CoV. The disease manifestation ranges from asymptomatic to severe,"" G Arunkumar, director of the Manipal Institute of Virology, told PTI. ""As per the available limited information, initial transmission appears to be zoonotic origin, though the source is yet be identified. There is report of human to human transmission in the press but needs to be confirmed by authentic sources,"" he said. The discovery of a novel strain of the virus in China has compelled nations to quarantine passengers from the country and issue travel advisories, while prompting the WHO to convene an emergency meet on the matter. Countries around the world have sounded an alert following the confirmation of the first case of human-to-human transmission of the deadly infectious disease. Cases have been detected in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. India has instructed screening of travellers from China at airports in Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata via thermal scanners. “The Emergency Committee on the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it,” WHO tweeted on Tuesday ahead of the meeting. How are coronoviruses spread?Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people, according to the WHO. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. On December 31, 2019, the WHO China Country Office was informed of mysterious cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan City in China's Hubei Province. The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative agent by Chinese authorities on January 7. The WHO has offered guidance to countries on how they can prepare for it, including monitoring the sick, and treating patients. This includes protocols for testing samples, treating patients, controlling infection in health centres, maintaining the right supplies, and communicating with the public about this new virus. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through the air by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands. The viruses can also spread by touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands, the CDC said. In pregnant women, the more severe versions of MERS and SARS coronaviruses can be serious. According to a case study published in 2014 in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, a woman infected with MERS had a stillbirth. Till date, there is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses. However, based on currently available information, the WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel or trade. “Countries are encouraged to continue strengthening their preparedness for health emergencies in line with the international health regulations,” the WHO said in a statement. It said standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. WHO also advises that people should avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
"Fears of mystery virus up, as China confirms more cases - Times of India","BEIJING: China has confirmed 17 more cases of people infected by a mysterious coronavirus, which has so far claimed two lives and caused sickness in at least 62 others. This is apart from innumerable fever and pneumonia patients who are being closely monitored for symptoms of the dreaded infection. These patients include an Indian woman, who is possibly the first foreigner under observation. India has already issued a health safety warning advising Indian travellers to be careful while visiting China. Hong Kong and Singapore are among the cities which are closely screening incoming visitors at airports for signs of the fever. There are signs of the virus spreading with Japan and Thailand confirming three cases, all of whom had recently visited Wuhan. Thailand has reasons to worry, as it will receive around 3,00,000 Chinese tourists during this festive season. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the new virus was not Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which killed more than 700 people around the world in 2003. The center said all the cases of this new infection are being treated in the central China city of Wuhan and rejected a suggestion that hospitals outside Wuhan had been secretly treating people infected with the virus. The spread of the virus has raised questions about how it is being transmitted. It is not clear if it is a case of human to human transmission, and with hundreds of millions of people in China expected to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, beginning on Friday, public health officials are working to stop a major outbreak. Some experts worry that the outbreak of the illness, causing pneumonia-like infection by the coronavirus, could be more severe than what China’s government has admitted.

"Japan confirms case of new Chinese virus, spread is 'concerning' - Times of India","TOKYO: Japan has confirmed its first case of infection from a newly-identified coronavirus that has killed one person and infected at least 40 more in China, as well as prompting a travel alert from the U.S. State Department. A man in his 30s from Kanagawa prefecture, next to Tokyo, tested positive, the health ministry said on Thursday. The man had been to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where there has been an outbreak of pneumonia believed to be caused by the new type of coronavirus, a ministry statement said. The US State Department issued a health alert update on Wednesday about travel to the Wuhan region. It referred to a Watch Level 1 Alert by the US. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging citizens travelling in the region to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions. Thai health authorities said on Wednesday they were stepping up monitoring of passengers arriving at airports ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, when 800,000 Chinese tourists are expected to visit Thailand. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some - such as the one behind Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) - are far more severe. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the new Wuhan virus could spread and has warned hospitals worldwide. Jeremy Farrar, a British-based infectious disease specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, said news of a case in Japan was ""extremely concerning"". He warned it was possible that multiple cases with mild symptoms might be masking the true numbers of people infected, indicating that many cases may be going unreported. ""Wuhan is a major hub and with travel being a huge part of the fast-approaching Chinese New Year, the concern level must remain high,"" he said in a comment emailed to Reuters. ""It is probable that we are looking at patients being affected over a number of days from multiple animal sources and with some degree of human-to-human transmission."" A Wuhan seafood market in particular is being investigated in connection with the infection, authorities there said on Dec 31. The Japanese patient returned from Wuhan this month with a fever and was hospitalised. He was released on Wednesday after the symptoms subsided, the health ministry statement said.

"Chandigarh: Bring ducks back to Sukhna lake, says environmentalist | Chandigarh News - Times of India","CHANDIGARH: A city-based environmentalist has written to the ministry of fisheries and animal husbandry to order the authorities in the city to bring ducks and geese back to Sukhna Lake. The water birds were removed in 2014 after the culling drive owing to avian flu. Rahul Mahajan, in his letter, said his NGO is willing to take care of the birds. The letter, “Birds at Sukhna Lake/cows in gaushala, Sector 45” has been sent to Giriraj Singh, minister of fisheries and animal husbandry and dairying. The letter reads, “It is a humble request that we want ducks/geese back at Sukhna Lake, which were removed from the lake in December 2014 due to culling by the department of animal husbandry and fisheries, UT.” “We request you to kindly ask the concerned department to provide the birds again at the lake.” Talking to TOI, he said, “Sukhna Lake was famous for the ducks and geese. The citizens of Chandigarh have sentiments attached with these birds. This is why I wrote to cabinet minister to allow them at Sukhna.” He said their NGO had earlier as well been taking care of the ducks at Sukhna. “Disease is always possible but that does not mean to finish their habitat. The disease can be from migratory birds but the domestic should be allowed,” he said. In the letter, he has also requested the minister to allow a gaushala in Sector 45 by using the vacant land managed by forest department, UT. He said the land could be given to gaushala only for temporary basis. In 2014, a report from Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases had confirmed that H5N1 avian flu virus was present in one of the domestic birds which had died at the lake. Following directions from the Union ministry of agriculture, action was taken and around 250 ducks were culled. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Telangana: 43 test positive for swine flu in last fortnight | Hyderabad News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: The number of swine flu cases in the state has risen. In the last fortnight, 43 cases have been reported, with many of these being from Hyderabad. Experts say that the number of cases may surge further in January, and an alert has been sent to hospitals to be prepared for the same. “While all district and area hospitals have been alerted on the possibility of swine flu cases increasing, currently cases are mostly being reported from private hospitals in and around the city. We have been expecting a surge in cases mostly in the month of January. As of now, out of 100 samples, less than 7% have turned out to be positive for the H1N1 virus,” said a senior official from the state health department. Since the beginning of November, when swine flu cases usually begin to rise, hospitals have already been alerted thrice to prepare isolation wards. However, this year, the rise in cases has begun late, with most cases being reported over the last fortnight. Usually the H1N1 virus become more active with a decrease in temperature, with the common symptoms being cough, cold, fever, body pain and breathlessness. Patients having cough or sore throat with high grade fever are in the high-risk category, which includes pregnant women, children, elderly and those with comorbid conditions. “Such patients should be immediately shifted to Gandhi Hospital and paediatric cases should be shifted to Niloufer Hospital, where adequately trained teams, other requisite equipment and treatment facilities are ready,” stated a recent advisory.

"Punjab: Keep H1N1 in check or face action, hospitals told | Chandigarh News - Times of India","CHANDIGARH: With 13 suspected cases of swine flu being reported in the state in the first three days of the year, the Punjab health department has issued guidelines to private and government hospitals for keeping a check on the surge in cases of H1N1 and also warned the institutes of police action if they did not follow the guidelines. Of 13 suspected cases, no case has been found to be positive so far. In eight years, 306 people have died due to swine flu in Punjab. Of these, 32 took place in 2019. The health department has directed both private and government hospitals in the state to set up isolation wards. To stop the virus from spreading, patients, either suspected or confirmed, should be kept in isolation, it said. The government is providing free treatment in all hospitals. Hospitals have been asked to put all cases of influenza H1N1 on treatment as per protocol without waiting for laboratory results. They have been directed to inform the health department about all swine flu cases, suspected and confirmed. Private laboratories or hospitals willing to carry out H1N1 tests will have to take permission from the health department. For implementing the guidelines, a committee headed by the civil surgeon will be constituted in each district and it will have a medical specialist, paediatrician, anaesthetist and district epidemiologist as members. The committee has been empowered to take action in case of disobedience of the guidelines. Those found not following the guidelines will be liable to punished under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code. Dr Gagandeep Singh Grover, state programme officer for Punjab's National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), said the health department had supplied required medicines to all government hospitals - three medical colleges, 22 district hospitals and 41 sub-divisional hospitals - and the medical staff has been vaccinated. The department is also spreading awareness about the flu. Terming late reporting as the biggest challenge, Dr Grover said in most of the cases in which patients lost their lives in the past were late in approaching doctors for treatment.

"Dengue menace: Minor girl dies, 1,269 cases in 2019 | Vadodara News - Times of India","VADODARA: An 11-year-old girl in Tarsali area died from dengue at the state-run SSG Hospital (SSGH) on December 11, confirmed the results of the dengue tests conducted on her which were furnished to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Tuesday. This is the first death due from the vector-borne disease this year after dengue kept the city in its grip in 2019. Ruchita Bariya’s blood sample report which came posthumously confirmed her death as due to dengue virus. VMC officials said that Ruchita died from dengue shock syndrome with multiorgan failure. The city registered 6,153 suspected dengue cases in 2019, of which 1,269 were confirmed as dengue. The total number of cases reported in 2016 was 1,514. VMC officials, however, said that the number of deaths could be considered on the lower side. “In 2016, 14 persons had died due to dengue. This year, the symptoms of the disease were much milder. Physicians managed to treat some patients even without admitting them in hospitals,” said an official. A concern, however, is that several private hospitals treated dengue patients after performing the rapid card test for dengue. The civic body is considering such private treatment as well as indicative tests not confirmatory. Officials confirm a dengue case only if the ELISA test is positive for the NS1 antigen and IgM antibodies. This had led to around 10 unconfirmed dengue deaths in the city during the year.

"Dengue may be widespread in Karnataka, but H1N1 is five times deadlier | Bengaluru News - Times of India","BENGALURU: Incidence of H1N1 may be less than dengue across Karnataka, but it has proved fatal in more number of cases. In the first 11 months of 2019, 96 people died due to H1N1 infection, compared to 13 who lost their battle to dengue. However, the number of dengue cases in the same period has been very high: 15,586 positive cases as against 1,973 persons affected by H1N1. While fatalities in dengue are less than 1%, in H1N1 it is close to 5%. According to senior officials in the health department, delayed diagnosis by private practitioners complicate matters in H1N1 cases. Many patients also lose vital time in getting referred from one hospital to another. ""H1N1 cases have reduced since August. This year, H1N1 infection was seen more in the Western Ghats region. That's how Shivamogga district saw more number of cases,"" said the officials. Sources said most H1N1 cases in Western Ghats region are finally being diagnosed in Udupi, Manipal and Mangaluru hospitals, which only means they are often not diagnosed in their places of origin. The highest number of H1N1 deaths in Karnataka this year has been reported from Shivamogga (17), followed by Davangere (12), Udupi (9) and Chitradurga (7). As per government data, no Bengalurean has died of H1N1, though the city reported 283 cases.. In comparison, 77% of the state's dengue cases are from Bengaluru, where there is high awareness among both doctors and patients, said officials. Dengue and H1N1 are the two notifiable major infections affecting public health scenario in Karnataka. H1N1 is a seasonal infection seen largely during winter, whereas dengue is seen throughout the year. While both are viral infections, anti-viral treatment and vaccination is available only for H1N1.  Dr Rajesh Mohan Shetty, chief of clinical services, lead consultant, department of critical care medicine, Manipal Hospitals (Whitefield), said it's possible that some H1N1 cases are initially dismissed as common cold and fever, considering the symptoms are similar. ""If fever is high and a patient is short of breath, it should not be ignored, nor treated as a case of common cold and fever,"" he said. Dr Rajesh said close family members are at the risk of contracting H1N1 infection from a patient. ""Anti-virus medication should be given to close relatives as well to prevent further spread of infection,"" he added. Some acute H1N1 patients also contract pneumonia, making such cases more complicated, leading to respiratory failure. To save such patients, private hospitals are even using artificial heart-lung machines.  ""We used extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for six patients this year. These could have otherwise proved fatal,"" said Dr Rajesh. Observing that delay in first-line treatment for H1N1 can cause complications, he said about 5-10% of 100 H1N1 infections can turn severe.

"Poland wants troops, police to shoot boars with swine fever - Times of India","WARSAW: Poland's agriculture minister on Wednesday proposed that army and police personnel should be allowed to shoot wild boars infected with African swine fever, to help fight the disease that has been found in the west of the country after it seemed contained in the east. Jan Krzysztof Ardanowski said proposed new legislation would also punish anyone obstructing the preventive killing of the animals, such as environmentalists. The disease appeared in Poland's east last year, believed to have been brought from neighboring Ukraine. Affected areas were fenced off at first but the disease spread and some 180,000 wild boar have been shot to contain it. The move was condemned by environmentalists, who tried to block it. The disease was found last week in a dead boar in a western region where there are also many pig farms, some 110 kilometers (68 miles) from the German border. The area is being fenced off, but massive shootings are necessary, Ardanowski argued on state Polish Radio 1. He said he will submit the draft law to parliament in coming weeks for swift processing.

With this, the total number of patients with influenza-like illness who were screened in the city so far this year has reached 9.83 lakh. ""Of the 9.83 lakh screened patients, we administered oseltamivir tablets popularly known as Tamiflu or Fluvir to a total 17,110 patients who were suspected to have contracted the infection,"" said a health official of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). As many as 173 patients have tested positive for the virus in the city so far this year. Of them, 54 have succumbed to the virus induced complication. Swine flu — just like any other flu — is a respiratory infection. It exploits a weakened immune system to attack major organs, especially lungs. When it gets into the lungs, it can lead to pneumonia, which can be fatal. The flu can also cause secondary infections to the body — any of which can lead to failure of vital organs and death. The symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to the symptoms of regular seasonal influenza and include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing. Some people with swine flu have also reported runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Taking medicine without consultation and delaying treatment can aggravate the condition. Experts say that people should continue to take precautions in terms of basic sanitation practices like frequent hand washing, good diet and healthy habits as the virus is still infecting people. People with co-morbid conditions should be more vigilant. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"With over 14,000 cases, Karnataka tops dengue list in the country | Bengaluru News - Times of India","BENGALURU: Over 35,079 cases of dengue have been reported from across the six states in south India till October this year, with the maximum number of them coming from Karnataka. According to information given by the government in Lok Sabha in reply to a question in Lok Sabha during the on-going session, Karnataka tops the list of the states that has reported the maximum number of cases in the country with 14,139 cases. The killer virus has been spreading its tentacles across the country with the six major south Indian states registering more than 50% of the cases. The mosquito-borne tropical disease has so far claimed 36 lives till October across the six states of South India including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. The data has also revealed that the country has reported 91,457 cases of dengue till October. The western Indian states of Maharashtra and Goa have reported 9,899 and 908 cases respectively. The number could go up further after the figures for November and December are collated, officials said. Karnataka, which is better placed in terms of having better health facilities both in private and government sectors, has been witnessing a steep increase in dengue cases. The state had recorded 4,427 cases in 2018. Of the 14,139 cases reported this year, around 70 percent cases were reported in Bengaluru within the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP) limits. Even majority of dengue deaths have reported from South. While 82 people have died due to dengue in the country in 10 months, 56 deaths have occurred in six states of south with Kerala reporting 16 deaths and Karnataka 13. So, why dengue is rising in South India? According to public health experts lack of public awareness and failure of authorities to contain the menance has led to the increase in mosquito breeding spots in the state. “The need is to create public awareness, which plays an important role in preventing mosquito breeding, said Pankaj Kumar Pandey, commissioner, health and family welfare department, Karnataka. The government has initiated a campaign in this regard. “The government has taken up massive IEC (information, education, communication) activities across the state with ASHA workers. The health workers will conduct house-house survey and distribute an educational material and a form to fill up. The head of household can fill the form that has queries on their understanding of mosquito control measures. We call this initiative ‘Nagarikarige Ondu Saval (A challenge to public), which has begun from November 1 and goes on till January 30, 2020,” he added. Some experts feel that the reporting pattern of dengue cases by the state also could be a reason for Karnataka outnumbering rest of the country in dengue. Only north India states which have reported high number of cases are Uttarakhand (9574 cases) and Gujarat (8,410). As many as 12 people have succumbed to dengue in Uttarakhand and eight in Gujarat. Interestingly, West Bengal, one of the highly populated states, has reported not even a single dengue case. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
34 lions had died in canine distemper virus outbreak: Gujarat govt | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"GANDHINAGAR: The state government on Tuesday raised the number of lion deaths in the disease outbreak of October 2018 — due to canine distemper, babesiosis, streptococcal bacteria and gram-negative bacilli — to 34 from the earlier figure of 29. To a question by Congress’s Khambhalia MLA Vikram Madam, the state government submitted a written reply in the assembly, said that 34 other infected lions had been caged and vaccinated. These were from Sarasia Virdi in the Dalkhaniya range.  “So far, the government was maintaining that 29 lions had died in the outbreak, but the government has now admitted the correct figure of 34,” a forest department official said, on condition of anonymity. The official said a recently published research paper by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) had put the figure of infected lions at 68, which now matches with the numbers the state admitted. The paper was published in a newsletter of the US-based Center for Disease Control (CDC). The study revealed that canine distemper virus (CDV) and Babesia infections, which killed 34 lions in September-October 2018, was detected in a total of 68 lions and six leopards. NIV Pune tested samples from 316 lions and 52 leopards. “The government had so far concealed the fact that 34 lions that were caged were also infected with CDV and other infections, and that they had been vaccinated,” the official said. The official said the CDV-infected lions were kept in quarantine on the pretext of being kept for the breeding purposes. Wildlife experts said these vaccinations had cured these big cats but as their immunity levels have suffered and they can become carriers of the virus and be dangerous for other lions. “Therefore, in the first week of May, the state forest department decided to indefinitely extend their captivity,” the official said. The state government reply stated that Rs 10.68 crore was spent on controlling the outbreak. Lions from various forest ranges including Sarasia Virdi were kept under observation at rescue centres in Dhari and Jamwala, the government reply said. After the lion deaths, 140 teams with a total of 550 staffers carried out a survey over 3,200 sq km, looking for lions with symptoms of CDV and Babesia infection.

Ahmedabad: 42% of dengue patients are children | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Parents beware. This year more than 42% of those detected with dengue infections were children below 15 years of age. If you have been careless at home when it comes to vector control or have generally overlooked your kid’s schools mosquito control precautions, you better take note. This year 4,195 dengue cases have been registered in the city, till November 30.  A detailed study of 6,434 dengue cases by Community Medicine Department of BJ Medical College, from 2010 to 2016, revealed that the dengue incidence was 16.3 per lakh population and the maximum incidence rate (26.2) was seen in children up to the age of 14 years, followed by 15-44 years where the incidence rate was 17.3 per lakh population. The study also revealed that the most common dengue virus serotype that was detected in the city was serotype-2, which happens to be a lethal dengue strain. The study was conducted to know the trend and epidemiological profile of dengue cases and deaths. Another startling fact revealed in the report was that nearly 58% of deaths registered between 2010 and 2016 were of children aged up to 14 years. A substantial increase in the dengue incidence was seen in the years 2015 and 2016. “Case fatality rate because of dengue was less than 1% while the proportion of deaths was maximum (57.89%) in children up to the age of 14 years,” the study states. This year, some 706 of the 4,000-odd dengue cases registered were that of children aged between 9 to 14 years. A senior official in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) health department said, “In many cases we have found that schools have been careless with vector control measures and since children spend a lot of their time there, they are more likely to be bitten by Aedes aegypti mosquitos.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Swine flu: No isolation beds, separate queues in hospitals | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: The H1N1 virus has already infected 550 people in the city and claimed seven lives, but three major government-aided hospitals here are doing precious little to prevent the swine flu scourge. It becomes more important given the fact that December-February are most conducive for the spread of H1N1 virus. A TOI reality check on Friday exposed how blatantly safety protocol and guidelines of the World Health Organisation are being violated at a time the seasonal intensity of the disease is expected to increase. According to WHO, every hospital should have separate registration counters for suspected swine flu patients and isolation wards for confirmed H1N1 cases. Posters with dos and don’ts for visitors must be put up everywhere while OPD signs should guide patients to exclusive waiting areas. There is no separate registeration counter for swine flu patients at Balrampur HospitalKing George’s Medical UniversityIn the absence of separate registration counters, evaluation chambers and waiting areas for suspected swine flu patients in the OPD, they were freely mixing with other patients. While the trauma centre and medicine department have isolation wards for swine flu cases, no exclusive bed was found in the casualty ward where critical patients are brought first. Doctors said a patient was sent to the isolation wards after swine flu confirmation. However, since test results take two days to arrive, it leaves enough scope for other patients in the casualty ward to be infected. Chief medical superintendent of KGMU professor SN Shankhwar said signs and awareness posters would be installed in a week across the campus. “All suspected cases will be directly transferred to isolation wards,” he added. Civil HospitalThe hospital neither has exclusive queues and waiting areas nor did TOI spot any awareness poster anywhere on the premises. To top it all, there is no isolation ward. Director of hospital Dr DS Negi promised to make all “required facilities available soon”, but didn’t specify how soon. Balrampur HospitalSuspected swine flu patients were seen coughing and sneezing without masks/handkerchiefs in common registration queues and waiting areas at the OPD. The hospital though has isolation wards in the emergency (one bed) and medicine (18 beds) wings while signs have also been placed. Spokesperson SM Tripathi said, “Separate queues/counters for suspected flu patients will be arranged soon and awareness posters too will be put up.”.

How swine flu virus has free run at OPDs in Lucknow | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: While the H1N1 virus is stalking the state capital with a seasonal incidence rate of more than three patients a day, swine flu prevention protocol is conspicuous by its absence at two super speciality hospitals in the city. A TOI reality check has revealed that Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) and Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) largely ignore guidelines set by the World Health Organisation despite Lucknow witnessing 550 cases in less than six months (January-March, October-December) and seven deaths till date. TimesViewPrevention is better than cure. SGPGI and Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences are top institutes of UP and must lead by example by following the preventive parametres prescribed by WHO. In fact, SGPGI gets suspected swine flu cases from across UP for confirmatory test. The flow of confirmed HINI influenza patients coming to SGPGI for treatment is also highest in comparison to other hospitals and medical institutes in the stat e. Precautionary measures would not only prevent spread of this highly contagious disease, but also reduce the burden of treatment. Similarly, RMLIMS can contribute in prevention and save valuable lives.An earlier survey had exposed similar healthcare anomalies at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Balrampur Hospital and SPM Civil Hospital. SGPGIMSThe state health department recognises as valid swine flu tests done only at two government hospitals and SGPGI is one of them. While KGMU is the other recognised institution, the maximum number of cases so far this year have been treated in SGPGI. Despite this significant place in healthcare hierarchy, the hospital OPD has no separate registration counter or isolated waiting lounge for suspected patients of swine flu, an air-borne viral disease that spreads through coughing, sneezing, shaking hands or touching contaminated surfaces. Awareness posters to promote wearing of masks, among other things, are missing as are signs to guide patients to diagnostic labs. At the old OPD building, a grimy poster with the message that swine flu test is conducted ‘here’ was found outside a room, but enquiry revealed that the facility had been shifted elsewhere. The only face-saver for SGPGI is an 11-bed exclusive ward for swine flu patients. “After registration, patients with flu-like symptoms are first sent to the pulmonary OPD and then to the lab. Those who test positive are admitted to the isolation ward. Since the report takes 48 hours, a suspected patient can infect many others during that gap in the absence of safety protocol,” said an OPD visitor. RML hospitalLike SGPGI, this hospital too disregards WHO recommendations to stall a swine flu outbreak. RML hospital may have a six-bed isolation ward, but the OPD is a virus cauldron where suspected patients freely mix with others. RMLIMS director AK Tripathi, who is also officiating director of SGPGI at present, promised to plug the loopholes ASAP. “I will direct chief medical superintendent of both institutes to follow standard guidelines of WHO without delay,” he said.

After West Nile fever was reported in March, five samples of crows were collected from Thennala region of the district which is adjacent region of AR Nagar panchayat where a 6- year-old boy had died of the infection. But the results of the samples collected were also turned out to be negative. The chief veterinary officer of Malappuram Dr Baby Joseph said that the negative results of samples of birds show that the chances of spread of the disease in the region through birds are very less.

"Mumbai: Of 393 HIV+ moms, only two babies contract virus | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Only two of the babies born to 393 HIV-positive mothers in Mumbai tested positive for the virus in 2018-19, indicating the city’s HIV-care programme has been effective in checking mother-tochild transmission of the virus. As HIV-positive mothers can transmit the virus to their newborn during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) started giving to-be mothers a three-drug regimen few years back to reduce the risk of transmission. Earlier regimens were not as effective in controlling transmission. In 2013, it was estimated that India had 1,45,000 HIVpositive children. But data of the last five years from Mumbai AIDS Control District Society (MDACS) shows a steady decrease in newborns who test positive for the virus at the end of 18 months. The PPTCT programme enrolled 517 HIV-positive pregnant women in 2014-15; 17 of the babies were found reactive for HIV at the end of 18 months of age. While the transmission percentage then was 3.2%, it reduced to 0.5% in 2018-19. “Our aim is to start HIV-positive mothers-to-be on the new multidrug regimen as soon as possible. Earlier in the pregnancy that they get the drugs, lower the risk of transmission,’’ said Dr Sreekala Acharya of MDACS. World Health Organization defines elimination of mother-tochild HIV transmission as one per one lakh deliveries. Considering that 1.5 lakh deliveries take place in Mumbai every year, doctors feel Mumbai is on the verge of achieving the target. Data from BMC’s hi-tech molecular diagnostic laboratory at Kasturba Infectious Diseases Hospital, near Saat Raasta, shows that positivity among children born to HIV-positive mothers is decreasing across the state. The lab gets samples for conducting DNA tests on dried blood spot samples from children born to HIV-positive mothers; the children are testeds at six weeks and 18 months of age. Between 2010-15, the laboratory tested 1,808 dried samples from children born to HIV-positive mothers and found 214 children were HIV-positive. There is a drop in the corresponding number after NACO’s new drug regimen: Of 1,410 samples tested between 2015-19, only 102 tested positive for HIV. Studies from centres across the country showed reduced transmission rates. A senior NACO official said the organization is still collating figures on this intervention. “But, yes, the mother-to-child transmission rate is dropping as expected,’’ the official added.

"Nipah scare: Union health minister Harsh Vardhan reviews public health measures, says situation under control | Kochi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, who reviewed the public health measures put in place in Kerala after a college student tested positive for Nipah virus, on Wednesday said the situation is under control and people need not panic. The 21-year-old college student's case is this year's first in Kerala. Last year, the Nipah virus killed 17 people in the state. ""I urge the people not to panic as the government is leaving no stone unturned to remedy the situation. I am personally reviewing the situation with Health Minister of Kerala, K K Shailaja, on a regular basis,"" Vardhan said. The key focus of Wednesday's review meeting was updating of contact list (line listing with contact details), daily follow-up for symptoms and self-monitoring, the health ministry said in a statement. The team also discussed SOPs for quarantine of symptomatic contacts, sample collection or testing and dedicated isolation facility with trained health staff for the care of cases and epidemiological investigation by the multi-disciplinary central team to ascertain the possible source of infection and history of exposure. The Centre had on Tuesday rushed a six-member team comprising an epidemiologist to Kerala to conduct contact tracing for early detection of suspects and review of isolation facilities. The team also stressed on the need for proper record-keeping in the district control room with daily sharing of information, the statement stated. A designated control room has been established at the district collector's office and an isolation ward has been established at Government Medical College Ernakulam, the statement said. Isolation facilities have also been ensured at Medical Colleges at Calicut, Thrissur and Kottayam, it said. All healthcare facilities have been asked to ensure a high index of suspicion in cases with similar symptoms and also ensure availability of isolation and emergency management facilities before referral, the ministry said. The statement said that the condition of the college student, a resident of Paravur, is now stable and a total of 314 contacts are being followed up on a daily basis. Five symptomatic contacts have been admitted in the quarantine facility at the medical college and samples have been sent for testing, it said. According to the statement, the student got a fever on May 23 when he was in district Thrissur. He visited a physician there but returned to his family in Ernakulum as he had a high fever. ""He consulted a private hospital in Ernakulam on May 25 and was treated with antibiotics. He was referred to another private hospital on the night of May 30 as he developed slight disorientation and gait imbalance,"" it said. ""Throat swab, CSF blood and urine samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology Alapuzha on June 2 which tested Nipah positive. The patient is stable, conscious and oriented at present. All three other family members are healthy,"" it added. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nipah virus is a newly emerging disease that can be transmitted from its reservoir (natural wildlife host), the flying foxes (fruit bats), to both animals and humans. It takes its name from Sungai Nipah, a village in Malaysia where it was first identified. Symptoms range from asymptomatic infection, acute respiratory infection (mild, severe), and fatal encephalitis. Infected people initially develop influenza-like symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia, vomiting and sore throat. This can be followed by dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs that indicate acute encephalitis. Some people can also experience typical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems, including acute respiratory distress. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

The field teams will camp and do physical inspection at places where the infected person stayed or frequented. As the outbreak epicentre remains undetermined, the team will now focus on preliminary inspection. “We will not begin sampling now because there is no need to create panic. No reports about signs of disease in animals have been reported,” said an official with the team. A high-level meeting was also held at the directorate on Tuesday. The department constituted a six-member state-level monitoring committee and a four-member monitoring cell at the district level on Tuesday. “We are closely monitoring any unnatural deaths or clinical signs among animals. All facilities are in place for collection of samples, but we are not starting any kind of sampling now because the source is unknown. Farmers have also been told to inform about the need to pass on alerts. Guidelines have been issued,” said director of animal husbandry (in charge) Dr PC Sunilkumar. A team of AHD officials inspected the house where the student had stayed on Tuesday. “Animals were found in three houses in the neighbourhood and none of them have disease symptoms. We also held a meeting with avian disease diagnostic lab team. There are no pig farms in the area and we couldn’t come across anything alarming,” said Dr Manju Sebastian, district veterinary officer in Idukki. Bats and pigs are the target species that are being monitored by field-level teams since they are the natural hosts. Other animals which are considered as incidental hosts will also be screened. The department is awaiting confirmation of source to kickstart elaborate disease-control procedure and sampling process. Minister for AHD K Raju has directed officials to open a control room in Ernakulam to coordinate disease prevention activities. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
RGCB lab offers to test samples for dreaded virus | Kochi News - Times of India,"KOCHI: In the wake of a positive confirmation for Nipah virus in Kerala, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) in the state which has bio-safety level 3 testing facility for Nipah virus has offered to conduct tests to detect the virus. “RGCB can test samples for Nipah virus at existing bio-safety (BS) level 3 facility. We have stocked the required six reagents for tests to detect Nipah,” RGCB director Prof M Radhakrishna Pillai told TOI. When asked about testing costs, he said, irrespective of the costs incurred, RGCB is willing to conduct tests free of cost in an emergency situation which is crucial to control the disease. If the Centre approves, then RGCB can set up BS4 lab facility in the 20 acre complex at Akkulam, he said. Existing BS3 facility will suffice for diagnostics of test samples for the virus, Radhakrishna Pillai said. Though RGCB had submitted a proposal to set up a BS4 facility which would incur an investment of Rs 100 crore, it is yet to be approved by the Centre. Installing a BS4 facility can help in advanced viral research, he said. It will incur huge maintenance costs, once initiated it cannot be switched off and it has to be operational 24/7 during all 365 days in a protective high bio-safety enclave, he said. Currently, two BS4 testing facilities are in the country including National Institute of Virology at Pune and Defence research lab at Bhopal. Yet, RGCB’s BS3 testing facility with in-vitro diagnostic certified machine for detection of all virus except Ebola is the only government lab in the country with three key certifications. “RGCB lab is the only facility in the country which has National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers and International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for testing all viral samples except Ebola,” RGCB senior scientist of molecular diagnostics Radhakrishnan R said.

The situation is well under control,’’ said a statement issued by the IMA. This is the second time the state is witnessing Nipah outbreak. The first outbreak was limited to Kozhikode and a few cases in Malappuram. This time it has been reported only from Ernakulam so far. Hence there are very remote chances for the virus to spread to other districts, said Dr M E Sugathan, state president of IMA. The expert committee convened at the IMA headquarters here observed there is a need for taking adequate precautionary measures to isolate the people who have been in contact with Nipah-positive patients. The isolated people should be under strict observation. The IMA leaders pointed out that unnecessary panic is created during such outbreak and a lot of misconceptions prevail among people. This was witnessed during the first outbreak in Kozhikode where people started staying indoors. There is no need for such panic as it spreads only if you have direct contact with Nipah positives. The high risk category are healthcare professionals who are directly involved in treating Nipah patients. Hence, the IMA has sent a detailed communique to 30,000 doctors in the state about the precautionary measures that have to be taken while treating patients, said Dr N Sulphi, state secretary of IMA.

"Dengue cases rise by 63%, doctors blame weather change | Aurangabad News - Times of India","AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC)’s dengue data of the last four years confirm an increase in dengue cases in the city by 63% since 2016. So far, there have been 11 dengue deaths in the city this year. Doctors blame the change in weather cycle and reduced immunity for the spurt in dengue virus cases. According to AMC medical officer, A Rane, who also holds the additional charge of malaria officer, the rise in dengue cases this year is not unique to the city. “Across Maharashtra, 9,000 dengue cases have been detected this year. There is indeed a sharp rise in the number of cases, and this can be attributed to the extended rainy season,” she said. Rane added that the water supply frequency has now increased to once in five days. Notably, the dengue virus carrying mosquito breeds in clean water. The AMC has appealed to residents to wash the containers before storing drinking water to prevent mosquito breeding. Anant Kulkrani, a doctor, observed that the severity of illness has also increased. “Many dengue patients have been infected for the second or third time in the last few years. Subsequent episodes of illness lead to reduced immunity and more complications,” he said. Kulkarni stated that the lesson learnt from the epidemic is to keep the immunity level high. “Eating balanced diet, having timely meals, exercising and maintaining a good lifestyle will keep the immunity high and protect one from getting infected with the virus,” Kulkarni said. Doctors also stressed the need for eliminating breeding points i.e. unnecessary collection of water anywhere near or inside the house. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Get dengue test results at KMC centres in an hour | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) health department is set to clear doubts about dengue tests being done at its ward centres. Armed with Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) technology, the civic laboratory technicians can confirm presence of dengue virus in a blood sample if there is doubt among doctors about the authenticity of earlier tests. The result will also come in less than an hour, said Atin Ghosh, deputy mayor, who also oversees KMC health department. Patients now need to wait for over eight hours for a soft copy of test report. The hard copy comes much later. “Besides dengue, the new technology will conclusively detect malaria, TB and typhoid, among other diseases. All such tests will be done free of costs depending on the condition and urgency of patients,” Ghosh said. Now, KMC doctors at dengue detection centres prescribe NS-1 test to a fever patient to determine, at a preliminary level, presence of dengue virus in blood samples. If the result is positive, the patient needs to go for a second test — Elisa — for confirmation of the earlier result. But, in some cases Elisa test fails to determine the presence of dengue virus conclusively. The new RT-PCR lab technology will give exact results. Ghosh said KMC is the first civic body in India to install such machines at dengue detection centres. In the first phase, four RT-PCR machines will be installed at Hatibagan, Haji Mohammed Mohsin Square, Layelka and Parnasree centres.

"28 dengue cases a day in November, Lucknow on the edge | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Unlike previous years when dengue cases in the city declined in November, the count is increasing rapidly this time. In comparison to seven cases a day in 2018, the rate of incidence has increased by four times this year. The first 10 days of the month this year has already seen 275 patients while the total number of cases reported in November last year was 238. In November 2017, the rate of incidence was below three cases a day. According to experts, the conditions are still favourable for the dengue vector like they were in November 2016, when the daily rate was 13 cases. As many as 400 people had contracted the dengue virus in 30 days that year. Head of microbiology at King George’s Medical University professor Amita Jain said freshwater accumulated in many places after postmonsoon rainfall was serving as breeding ground. “The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the dengue virus, has a life span of around 20 days. The survival rate of its larvae is maximum when the daytime temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius and the reading at night is above 16 degrees Celsius. The present maximum and minimum temperatures are, therefore, making the vector thrive,” she explained. Joint director of state vector-borne disease control unit Vikas Singhal maintained that dengue cases soared every third year. “We were expecting a spike in numbers this year and accordingly, preventive measures were taken. Hence, the number of cases and fatalities are less compared to 2016,” he contended. Chief medical officer Narendra Agarwal said the health department’s anti-larvae drive had found that though people had stopped using desert coolers, many left water in tanks, which were serving as breeding ground.

"ISRO news: After Mars, Venus on Isro’s planetary travel list | India News - Times of India","SRIHARIKOTA: Six years after courting Mars, India has planned seven scientific missions in the next 10 years, including a date with Venus in 2023. While the spacecraft to Venus will lift off with more than 20 payloads, the next decade will start with interplanetary missions — Xposat to study cosmic radiation in 2020, Aditya L1 to the Sun in 2021, Mars Orbiter Mission-2 in 2022, Lunar Polar Exploration or Chandrayaan-3 in 2024 and Exoworlds, an exploration outside the solar system in 2028. Venus is considered to be earth’s ‘twin sister’ because of its similarities in mass, size, composition, density and gravity. The mission to the planet will focus on studying the surface and its sub-surface, atmospheric chemistry and the interactions with solar radiation or solar winds. The mission has got many excited. “We have received great response from across the world, and more than 20 payloads planned,” said Isro chairman K Sivan, who was in Sriharikota on Friday to address 108 school students as part of the Yuvika-2019 Young Scientist Programme. “Aditya L1 and Xposat missions have been defined. The rest are in planning stages,” Sivan added. According to him, Aditya L1, the Sun mission, may play a key role in understanding and predicting climate change on Earth. The payloads will study the solar corona. “Corona has an influence on the upper atmosphere and that impacts climate change on earth. If we can understand the solar corona better, we may be able to predict climate change,” he said. The launch may happen earlier than planned, as Sivan said the spacecraft will lift off by mid-2020 and will be placed in a ‘libration orbit’, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth. It is about 1% of the distance between Sun and Earth, where the gravity of the two celestial objects equalises. Placing it in such an orbit allows the spacecraft to circle along with the earth, thereby constantly facing Sun. In a presentation made during the 60th session of United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, Isro scientists had said that Xposat will be a five-year mission, carrying a polarimeter instrument made by Raman Research Institute to measure cosmic radiation. The spacecraft will be placed in a circular 500-700km orbit. For this year, Isro’s biggest mission, Chandrayaan-2 is all set for a July launch. Sivan said the spacecraft, including the orbitor, lander and rover, will be flight-ready by the end of May. “The components are in the final stages of testing. Though we would be ready by end of May, we have to wait till July due to an eclipse,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Gujarat: Doctors watching change in dengue patterns closely | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: The typical case of dengue ended in three to five days with the high fever gone and the platelet count having improved. Patients, after adequate hydration and rest, would have been back to their usual routines. But not any more. “This year, due to a change in the strain of the dengue virus, the symptoms are more severe. A few paediatric patients had come with anemia, where the haemoglobin count is 3.5 or lower, without bleeding. If the complications continue, it could lead to viral encephalitis,” said Dr Vivek Dave, a city-based critical care specialist. “Hydration is key and even after the fever subsides, there should be regular follow-ups with doctors to prevent complications.” Dr Anish Joshi, another critical care specialist, said that this year they have seen very few cases of malaria compared to dengue, whereas in other years, the ratio was 50:50. “If there is a fever for more than 24 hours and symptoms such as bodyache, headache, stomach ache or vomiting, consult a doctor. Get the CBC test done. A sudden drop in platelet count is very common in dengue but medical attention is needed to reduce further adverse effects,” he said. Doctors said relapses of dengue were more common this year, where symptoms return after 2-4 days of complete recovery. Children and the elderly are more affected by the severity of such relapses, they added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Going by statistics of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), there are just nine states, which have reported more cases of dengue than Bhopal alone. Dengue cases numbering 1,082 and 300 Chikungunya cases have been diagnosed so far in Bhopal this year, the highest for any year on record. In the last 48 hours, the state capital has reported 10 new dengue-related cases. The previous high for dengue cases in Bhopal was 1,077 in 2017. About a dozen people have died this year. However, the figure disputed by the state health department, which maintains that there has been just one dengue death in Bhopal. According to experts, dengue mosquito cannot survive in temperature below 16 degrees Celsius. The city’s minimum temperature has hovered around 18 degrees in the past week. For November, almost 100 cases of dengue have been reported by five government-run dengue testing facilities in Bhopal. Doctors are still warning patients with symptoms of dengue to be vigilant. “Dengue breeding might stop, but a mosquito virus can sustain for over a week. It would be another few days until we see a drastic drop in dengue cases,” said a health department official. Unseasonal rainfall over the past few weeks has also weakened the vector-borne outbreak. Unseasonal rains up fears of H1N1 cases: Unseasonal rains have now added to fears of a spurt in cases of swine flu in the state capital. According to sources, over the past few weeks, swab samples from more than 40 suspected cases have been sent to AIIMS-Bhopal, GMC and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) laboratory in Jabalpur. Swine flu alert was declared in a reported case in Bhopal earlier this August.  “Due to unseasonal rainfall in the last few days, there is a likelihood of increase in H1N1 cases as the conditions are considered ideal for the spread of the virus,” a health official added. As per government data, swine flu cases are at record levels. So far this year, 720 H1N1 cases have been reported in Madhya Pradesh, leading to 165 deaths. However, with the unseasonal rains, people fear that there may be a rise in H1N1 cases. Gandhi Medical College (GMC) chest physician and allergy specialist Dr Lokendra Dave said, “It is not just those who are H1N1 positive. Over the last two weeks, patients with pneumonia have also been marked as critical. There has been a drastic increase in viral influenza. Anybody with symptoms of common cold and cough needs to seek immediate treatment. Prevention is the only cure.” Migration during the holiday season is considered a major cause for the spread of the H1N1 contagion. The district health department is already stretched after a dengue epidemic hit the city in July. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Dengue cases cross 1000-mark, over 230 fresh cases in 1 week | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Dengue cases have spiked in the national capital in the last one week, taking the total number of people affected by the vector-borne disease this year in the city to over 1,000, according to civic authorities. As per the report released on Monday, the number of malaria cases recorded till November 2 has also risen to 617, it said. Till October 26, the city had recorded 833 cases of dengue. With 236 fresh cases added in one week, the total currently stands at 1,069, the civic authorities said. Of the total dengue cases, October saw 787, the highest in any month so far his year while in the same month 249 malaria cases were also recorded, according to the report. Besides, 551 dengue cases were recorded in October, 190 in September, 52 in August, 18 in July, 11 in June and the rest were registered between January and May, according to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which tabulates the data on vector-borne diseases in the city. Fifty-six malaria cases were recorded in August, 54 in July, 35 in June, eight in May and one in April, it said. Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain last week had said the national capital had recorded the lowest number of cases of dengue this year, in comparison to the last five years, and appealed to Delhiites to keep up the collective efforts till the next month. ""Latest figures show that till October 26 there have been 833 cases of dengue in Delhi this year so far, and there has been no casualty. This is the lowest figure for Delhi in the last five years,"" he said. The minister said Delhi is ""well on course to defeat dengue this year"" and appealed to people to keep working on preventive measures and build more awareness. According to the report, at least 143 cases of chikungunya have also been reported this year. Last year, 2,798 dengue cases and four deaths were recorded by the SDMC. It had also reported 473 cases of malaria and 165 cases of chikungunya. Both the Delhi government and the local bodies have been making efforts to raise awareness on precautions to ensure that there is no breeding of mosquito larvae. The AAP government has started an anti-dengue campaign '10Hafte, 10Baje, 10Minute' urging people to inspect their house for any standing water. The campaign -- from September 1 and November 15 -- to combat dengue has garnered support from several personalities, including cricket legend Kapil Dev, many Bollywood actors and well-known journalists. Dengue mosquito larvae breed in clear, standing water, while those of malaria thrive even in dirty water. Doctors have advised people to take precautions and ensure that there is no breeding of mosquito larvae around them. They have urged people to wear full-sleeves and use mosquito nets. Water coolers should be dried up when not in use as mosquitoes carrying dengue virus usually breed there, a doctor said. Cases of vector-borne diseases are usually reported between July and November, but the period may stretch till mid-December. Meanwhile, mosquito-breeding has been reported in at least 1,69,021 households and 1,34,328 legal notices have been issued this year. From public schools to government office premises, several institutions have been penalised by civic authorities in north Delhi in the last five months over breeding of mosquito larvae on their premises, officials had earlier said.

Swine flu claims 6th victim in Lucknow | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: The city has recorded its first swine flu death since August with a 51-year-old man succumbing to the highly contagious disease caused by the H1N1 virus. Although Daliganj resident Manoj Kumar breathed his last at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) on October 19, his death was logged in the chief medical officer’s audit only on Saturday. With this, the swine flu toll in the city since January rose to six. TimesViewSwine flu reared its ugly head, while Lucknow is barely able to cope with a dengue outbreak. The spread of the two viruses can be contained through efficient planning and coordinated efforts of health department and civic agencies. Had LMC and the department launched fogging drives in a planned manner, the dengue outbreak – now on the verge of breaking the 2016 record – could have been prevented. Swine flu has affected nearly 50 people and claimed one life in the city over the past two months, but the authorities are yet to launch awareness drives or any preventive measures in public places.A woman from Aliganj, Ranjana Pathak (66), detected with H1N1 infection, also died at KGMU on October 19. However, doctors have listed the cause of her death as multi-organ failure due to diabetes, hepatitis C and renal failure. Late hospital reports delayed confirmation of death: CMO Chief medical officer Narendra Agarwal said Kumar was admitted to the isolation ward of the emergency trauma medicine unit of KGMU with breathing difficulties and chest congestion on October 16. He was put on ventilator support on October 19, but did not make it. On why his office took 15 days to confirm the cause of death as swine flu, Agarwal said: “Usually, a death audit is completed in three days, but the hospital records arrived late and then there were (festive) holidays.” Speaking on Pathak’s case, Agarwal said the audit team found that she died of renal failure and hepatitis C complications. “Her brain and heart stopped functioning,” he added. Associate professor of medicine D Himanshu reiterated that Pathak was admitted with respiratory problems and died of multiple complications arising out of failed kidneys and liver. The swine flu season, according to the health department, begins around August and lasts till March. Out of 550 cases this year, 511 were reported in the first season (January-March) and 39 since August. As many as 250 people had tested positive in February, followed by 214 in March. The patient count was much less at 27 in January and 30 in April. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Swine flu returns to haunt Lucknow with 55-fold rise in cases | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: It is not only dengue that is creating havoc in the state as swine flu (H1N1 virus) has also raised its ugly head registering a whopping 55-fold rise in the number of cases as compared to last year. While only 37 H1N1 cases and six deaths were reported in 2018, at least 2,086 people have been tested positive and 35 of them have lost their lives till October this year. Lucknow has registered the highest 550 cases this year. TimesViewThe health department has given directions to government hospitals to create isolation wards for swine flu patients and get medical staff vaccinated, but it also needs to create awareness among people to check the spread of the disease. Apart from general awareness through media, posters and placards should be put up in hospitals informing people about precautions. Separate arrangements should be made for the patients suffering with any kind of flu or with flu symptoms in the hospital and they should not be allowed to mix with others till the test rules out swine flu.According to experts, swine flu cases will increase in coming days as the virus flourishes from January to March and August to October. According to the data shared by the office of director (communicable diseases), 2,086 people have been tested positive this year, including 1,967 cases and 27 deaths between January and May. Despite being considered ‘off season’, eight cases were reported in June. A patient was tested positive in July who later succumbed to infection. In the second half of the year, 13 cases were reported in August, 49 in September and 48 in October. Four and three deaths, respectively, occurred in September and October. Between August and October, at least 110 cases and seven deaths have been reported across UP with Lucknow clocking the highest 40 H1N1 cases. District-wise comparison reveals that Lucknow registered 511 cases from January to July, 10 in August, 19 in September and 10 in October. Seven pregnant women tested positive in September and October. Meerut, with 399 swine flu cases and five deaths till October, is at second place followed by Ghaziabad (337 cases and one death). Director, communicable and vector-borne diseases, Mithilesh Chaturvedi said: “Though H1N1 cases have increased manifold this year, the fatality rate (number of deaths in every 100 positive cases) is low. The rate has come down to 1.68 this year as compared to 16.22 in 2018 and 3.40 in 2017 because of steps taken by the health department.” “Adequate supply of Tamiflu to primary health centres and district-level hospitals has been ensured. Funds have been provided for emergency requirements and isolation wards have been created in hospitals. Medical staff is also being vaccinated,” she said.

 Bats in Nagaland may carry Ebola family of viruses: Study | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Bats in some parts of Nagaland may harbour filoviruses, a family of viruses that includes the Ebola and Marburg viruses, putting people who hunt them at the risk of contracting deadly diseases, according to a recent study. The researchers, including Ian Mendenhall from Singapore as well as Pilot Dovih and Uma Ramakrishnan from Bangalore's National Centre for Biological Sciences, analysed the blood serum samples from bats hunted by people in Nagaland's Mimi village. The results of the study, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases on Thursday night, revealed that some bats sampled in the study may have been exposed to filoviruses as they found antibodies (proteins reactive to specific parts of an infective agent) in the serum taken from the bats. ""In the Northeast Indian state of Nagaland, local ethnic groups have conducted bat harvests for at least seven generations as a source of food and traditional medicine. These bat hunters are exposed to saliva, blood, and excreta from the bat species Rousettus leschenaultii and Eonycteris spelaea,"" the researchers wrote in the study. The study calls for better community-based monitoring of bats in specific regions to prevent an epidemic outbreak in the future. ""We report the presence of filovirus (eg ebolavirus, marburgvirus and dianlovirus) reactive antibodies in both human (eg bat hunters) and bat populations in Northeast India, a region with no historical record of Ebola virus disease,"" the researchers wrote in the study. Five of the 85 human serum samples taken from the villagers contained antibodies, they said. This meant there was evidence of immune reaction against three different filoviruses, they explained. ""We have antibodies in the bats that react against three different filovirus surface proteins – these are the part of the virus against which most antibodies are made,"" study co-author Ian Mendenhall from the Duke-National University of Singapore told PTI in an email interview. ""One is most likely Mengla virus, described earlier this year from a site in China 800 kilometres away, and in one of the same bat species in the harvest. The other two filoviruses are probably unknown,"" he added. However, the researchers said that they did not detect evidence of the filoviruses themselves. Mendenhall reasoned that this could either be due to the bat sample size in the study being small, due to a weak presence of the virus in the serum, or high genetic diversity of the filovirus family that is not captured by the tests employed. It is unknown if these viruses are pathogenic or if they are present in the bats without causing any symptoms, he added. ""We are continuing our studies in this region to better understand their risk to public health,"" he said. The researchers said some factors prevented filovirus disease outbreaks in Asia. These included ecological barriers that prevented transmission of these viruses from animals to humans, the viruses being unable to sustain transmission between humans, or the presence of diverse, closely related filoviruses that cause infection without symptoms in humans. However, Mendenhall cautioned that any increase in bat-human contact can increase the risk of an infectious disease crossing over to humans. He said this may happen through changes in the landscape where humans and bats cohabit, leading to increased interactions with humans, or through amplifying hosts like livestock or other wildlife. ""This was seen in the SARS Coronavirus outbreaks in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province China and the Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1999,"" he told PTI. The researchers cautioned that any contact infected bats may have with wild animals provides an opportunity for these viruses to jump the species barrier and start infecting new animal populations -- a phenomenon that researchers call a spillover infection. However, Mendenhall said the incidence of this is incredibly rare ""as one requires a virus that encounters a susceptible host (e.g. a human – ecological barrier), is able to replicate in it (cellular barrier as it needs the right cellular receptor), and it needs to be transmitted from human to human (epidemiological barrier)"". He said that it is still unknown if there is any increased risk of filovirus spillover in India since there is no evidence of a past outbreak in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Ebola and Marburg viruses are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fevers which affects many organs and damages the blood vessels, killing more than 50 per cent of people they infect.

Pune: Bibvewadi woman seventh dengue victim this year | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: A 31-year-old woman from Bibvewadi succumbed to dengue fever-induced complications at the KEM hospital on October 23. This is the seventh dengue casualty in the city so far this year. ""The woman's platelet count had dropped terribly low to 12,000 per microlitre of blood when normal count is in the range of 1.5 lakh to 4.5 lakh. She was also anaemic and succumbed to dengue fever-induced complications on October 23,"" said a doctor at the KEM hospital. Dengue cases have been on a record high in October. The Pune Municipal Corporation's record revealed that 2,039 people tested positive for the disease between October 1 and October 27. This is the highest number of dengue cases reported in a month so far this year. Climatic conditions with extended rain, along with the city's dense population, have provided a fertile ground for the spread and growth of dengue virus, experts said. The city has been registering deaths caused by dengue-associated complication since March this year. The city reported its first dengue death this year on March 27, when a 55-year-old woman died of dengue fever-induced complications.

Uttarakhand: 50 patients at Coronation infected with Hepatitis C | Dehradun News - Times of India,"DEHRADUN: An inquiry has been ordered by the administration of state-run Coronation Hospital in the city, after 50 of its patients, receiving dialysis at the hospital’s dialysis unit, were diagnosed with Hepatitis C. The chilling revelation has posed a serious question mark on the quality of treatment and sterilization methods being used at the hospital. While hospital authorities passed the buck to the private agency that has been running its dialysis unit under public-private partnership mode, the private company, claimed innocence. Dr B C Ramola, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the hospital, told TOI the problem was identified when a patient receiving dialysis at its privately-run centre, approached him to complain that he had been prescribed costly medicines by doctors at the dialysis centre. “We found that the prescribed medicines, costing around Rs 9,000 per month, were not for nephrological (kidney) issues, but for Hepatitis C (a liver disease). Our curiosity was also aroused because the private doctor had prescribed medicines from outside, when the government gives out Hepatitis C medicines for free. Upon enquiry, it was found that 50 patients undergoing dialysis at the centre have been diagnosed with the infection in the past two months. All of them had got blood tests done at the private centre, whose doctors had subsequently prescribed medicines from outside,” said Dr Ramola. He added that a committee of three senior doctors has been set up to probe the matter, which has to submit its report in three days. A doctor who is part of the committee, on condition of anonymity, told TOI it looks like a case of fraud. “Either the private centre used infected syringes, apparatus or blood that infected 50 patients, or they are hand-in-gloves with a drug manufacturer that sells Hepatitis C medicine,” he said. He added that a second test done by one of the 50 patients at AIIMS Rishikesh has revealed he was never affected by Hepatitis C. “We’ll interrogate all affected patients and the company’s employees,” he added. Officials of the company when queried denied the allegations, adding they will respond to each point in the administration’s notice within 72 hours. Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by Hepatitis C virus (HCV), which can cause acute and chronic Hepatitis, characterised by mild illness to a serious, lifelong ailment.

Mutated dengue virus may elude easy detection: Doctors | Visakhapatnam News - Times of India,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Latest international research on the dengue virus shows the mutation and emergence of new strains in the United States, reports the New England Journal of Medicine, with the impact being felt in India as well. Symptoms of dengue fever, such as high fever, are absent in the mutated strain. In Vizag city, two to three patients are admitted to the state-run King George Hospital (KGH) everyday while private hospitals have also seen a spurt in dengue cases. Some patients, however, do not report a high fever or joint and muscle pain and other symptoms of the disease, making detection based on clinical examination difficult. District epidemiologist and nodal officer for dengue in the district, Dr L Kalyanprasad, said, “In dengue-endemic areas, the virus can be present in any person but only those with low immunity and other comorbid conditions like diabetes, TB, cancer will catch the infection quickly. In some ante-natal cases kept in KGH dengue ward, fever is absent but the pregnant women have tested positive for dengue,” adding that, “Sometimes, the fever can completely subside in a day or two, misleading patients into thinking that they have recovered. But the actual complexity of dengue manifests after the fever appears to have subsided.” General physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao said, “Even if platelet count falls below 20,000/ml, it can be indicative of some other viral fever and not necessarily dengue. Alternately, irregular high and low fever also misleads patients into thinking that they may be suffering from dengue. Dengue can switch from the reversible to the fatal zone within 24-48 hours. People recover on their own from normal dengue but in 5-10 per cent of the cases, severe shock syndrome and haemorrhagic spots develop on the body, followed by bleeding, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, renal failure and ultimately multi-organ failure.” Dr Kalyanprasad added, “Most dengue cases do not require specific treatment but only symptomatic treatment with paracetamol, lots of fluid intake and adequate rest. Rather, the patient may contract hospital-acquired pneumonia and other infections if admitted to the ICU. Platelet transfusion may also give rise to allergic reactions. Rural medical practitioners (RMPs) and quacks as well as self-medication with pain relievers often complicate usual dengue cases leading to haemorrhage.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Lucknow: Dengue stings 39 in a day, may touch 1,000 mark in October | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: With 39 people, including a junior doctor of KGMU, testing positive for dengue on Thursday, the count in the city touched 701 this year. This is not only the highest number of dengue infected people since 2016 but also that in a single day for this year. A total of 215 dengue cases were reported in 2017 and 672 in 2018. The vector-borne disease has also claimed four lives in the state capital this year so far, also the maximum when compared to two in 2017 and one in 2018. In 2016, the city had witnessed a major dengue outbreak when 1,082 cases were reported and 18 people had lost their lives because of this vector-borne disease. As the number of cases reported daily has been steadily increasing this month, experts said that the count may touch the 1,000-mark in the coming days. The dengue virus, however, loses steam when maximum temperatures drop below 25 degrees Celsius. This means that people need to take precautions at least for two to three more weeks. Among Thursday's patients, 21 were male and 18 female. Three patients-two boys aged 8 and 11 years and a 32-year-old woman-were critical. While the two children are undergoing treatment at Civil hospital, the woman has been admitted to KGMU. The remaining patients are out of danger and recovering at home.

KSRTC’s Volvo multi-axle sleeper buses to dent private operators biz | Bengaluru News - Times of India,"BENGALURU: The recently launched Ambaari Dream Class (multi-axle Volvo AC sleeper) buses of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) are set to give private bus operators a run for their money on long-distance routes. This is the first time KSRTC is launching multi-axle Volvo AC sleeper buses. KSRTC is operating six Ambaari Dream Class buses to Pune, Hyderabad and Vijayawada since April 15. It is likely to induct 16 more buses to cities such as Ernakulam, Mumbai and Shirdi by June-end. KSRTC operates Ambaari in the sleeper-coach category, and the introduction of Volvo AC sleeper buses is expected to offer a comfortable journey to long-distance passengers. In fact, KSRTC had sought suggestions from the public for a brand name for the multi-axle Volvo AC buses. However, KSRTC started the Ambaari Dream Class service without any fanfare due to the election model code of conduct. KSRTC officials said Ambaari Dream Class fares are cheaper than those of its private counterparts, but costlier than Ambaari Corona AC sleeper buses. According to KSRTC website (ksrtc.in), fare for Ambaari Dream Class service from Bengaluru to Hyderabad is Rs 1,604, against Rs 1,169 charged by its Corona AC sleeper buses. Similarly, the Bengaluru-Vijayawada fare is Rs 1,703 compared to Rs 1,323 in Corona AC sleeper buses. On Bengaluru-Pune route, it is charging Rs 1,902 against Rs 1,578 on Corona AC sleeper buses. However, travel booking sites show private operators are charging up to Rs 2,300 on Bengaluru-Hyderabad, Rs 2,900 on Bengaluru-Vijayawada and Rs 3,700 on Bengaluru-Pune routes for Volvo AC multi-axle sleepers on Saturday Passengers demand fare reduction in Ambaari Dream Class “It’s a welcome move that KSRTC is operating multi-axle Volvo AC sleeper buses. Private operators have been fleecing passengers during weekends and festivals. The fare is a bit expensive, but we hope the KSRTC would reduce it by at least Rs 300 per ticket,” said Srikanth Reddy, a regular passenger on Bengaluru-Hyderabad route. KSRTC officials said they have received an overwhelming response for the Ambaari Dream Class services despite lack of publicity. “The fares are high as they are more comfortable than the regular Ambaari buses. There is a high demand for AC sleeper buses and we hope more passengers would shift from private buses,” said a senior KSRTC official. “We are also planning to revise the fares of Ambaari Dream Class and it may be reduced by Rs 200 per ticket”, the official adds. Meanwhile, KSRTC officials said there is a growing demand for sleeper buses along long distance routes. “We are also thinking of inducting about 50 additional AC and non-AC sleeper buses, which will further increase the competition and private bus operators in luxury segment will feel the heat” said an official. A private bus operator admitted that entry of Ambaari Dream Class buses will increase the competition in the luxury segment. “But every year there is an increasing demand from the passengers for luxury sleeper buses and the supply is less. Most passengers particularly youngsters prefer sleeper buses since it is more convenient for an overnight journey”. In 2002, KSRTC became the first state-run bus corporation in the country to induct Volvo single-axle AC seater buses under Airavat brand. In 2009, it introduced Ambaari (Corona single-axle AC sleeper) buses. The 15m-long sleeper buses will have a capacity of 40 passengers compared to the 12-m long Corona sleeper buses that can carry 32. At present, KSRTC has 73 AC sleeper buses, 115 non-AC sleeper buses, 483 AC seater and 8,002 non-AC seater buses plying on various routes. TN blocks move to operate more KSRTC services to KeralaBengaluru: The attack on two passengers in a Bengaluru-bound private bus in Kerala has triggered the need for more government-run buses and trains between Bengaluru and Kerala. Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) officials said they have signed an agreement with their counterparts in Kerala to operate 24 new buses on 11 routes to places like Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad via Tamil Nadu. However, they are unable to operate these buses without permission from Tamil Nadu government. At present, KSRTC operates 64 buses and Kerala RTC runs 55 buses from Bengaluru. However, passengers travelling between the neighbouring states have been demanding more services. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have not signed an interstate transport reciprocal agreement since 2007-08. Sources say private bus operators are allegedly pressurising TN not to sign an agreement with Karnataka as additional KSRTC services would hit their revenue.

"Dengue on death march in Lucknow, three areas await fogging | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: The dengue virus is on a deadly hunt, having claimed four lives in the city till date this year, but civic agencies seem to be doing precious little to contain the menace. The four deaths have taken place between October 10 and 22 in Fazullahganj, Daliganj, Keshavnagar and Madiaon. A TOI reality check in three of these areas on Wednesday revealed the sorry state of the much-touted anti-vector campaign of the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) and health department. To check the prolific population growth of the Aedes aegypti mosquito - the carrier of the dengue virus - anti-larvae drives and fogging need to happen back to back. The spray kills the larvae and fogging eliminates adult mosquitoes. However, spraying and fogging are conspicuous by their absence in Daliganj, from where victim Aman Chandpuri (22) hailed. In Keshavnagar and Madiaon, where larvicide was sprayed on Tuesday but fogging didn't take place on Wednesday. Residents complained that spraying was done twice this season - first when patients were diagnosed with dengue and then when they died. In Daliganj, vacant plots buried in dense undergrowth had mosquitoes swarming all over. Satendra Verma, a neighbour of deceased Aman, said another friend of his was battling dengue at a private hospital. ""Our building is a den of mosquitoes,"" he stressed. Mohammad Talib, another neighbour, added that no fogging or spraying had taken place after Aman's death on October 12. In Keshavnagar, where victim Geeta Dwivedi (58) lived, choked drains and mounds of garbage are mosquito breeding ground. ""If the death of a person doesn't move the civic authorities, what will I wonder,"" said Brijendra Pratap Singh, Dwivedi's neighbour. ""I have bought a fogging machine to help myself and the others,"" he added. In Madiaon, people accused LMC sanitation workers of not performing their duties, leading to clogged drains that serve as a haven for mosquitoes. ""Dengue had claimed the life of my 24-year-old son in 2016. This year, we lost another person to the disease. But, nothing has changed in three years in our locality,"" Virendra Kumar, a neighbour of victim Meenakshi Shukla (36), said with a resigned sigh.

"In Indore, unknown virus claims 64 lives in four months | Indore News - Times of India","INDORE: An unknown virus showing identical symptoms of swine flu has claimed 64 lives in the city and nearby districts in last four months. Officials said that of the total suspected samples sent to virology lab in Bhopal, 39 were found swine flu positive including 13 deaths and 350 were dengue positive including one death. However, there is a virus which is yet to be identified and it has claimed 64 lives. ‘Stringent measures needed for early swine flu diagnosis’IDSP officer Dr Amit Malakar said, every year swine flu virus changes its genes which are identified by health department and accordingly antiviral medicines are updated. “In 2015, the virus was identified as California swine flu which was named after the place where H1N1 death is recorded for the first time. The same mutated to a new form of virus identified as Michigan H1N1 Influenza in next two years,” said Dr Malakar. Michigan strain of H1N1 arrives, but state’s vaccine armoury emptyThis year the virus has not been identified due to which in many deaths, the samples didn’t confirm either swine flu or dengue. “There is a common nature of virus found in sample of these 64 patients, however, the type of virus is yet to be identified. In most of the cases, it was found that the patient was suffering from cold and cough. The symptoms were similar to swine flu for which it was sent. However, the virus attacks immune system and leads to death,” said the doctor. Officials said that recently instead of H1N1, samples were found H2N3 positive and medicines given to swine flu positive patients were not effective. Till now 510 H1N1 suspected samples have been sent for test, of which 39 samples were found positive. Reports of 16 samples are still pending.

Dengue claims one more medical student's life in Ahmedabad | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: The dengue virus spread by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito is getting fiercer by the day with the virus claiming another medical student’s life in the city. The state health authorities said that a 20-year-old MBBS student Riya Patel, is suspected to have died in the city on Friday night in a hospital in the city. State health authorities told TOI, “We are analysing the patient’s record and will inform the city municipal health officials,” said a senior state health official. The authorities did not reveal the name of the private hospital. Patel belongs to Patan’s Krushnanagar Society of Kalyana village in Siddhpur taluka.  She was a third year medical student at Jamnagar and was at her home in Patan for the last few days after she took ill. “Her condition deteriorated while at home and was shifted to an Ahmedabad-based hospital where she succumbed,” says the state health official. Officials claimed that of the four dengue virus subtypes, the DenV2 subtype is the most dominant and lethal strain prevalent this season. “We have found DenV3 subtype too,” adds the health official. In all, 946 people have reported dengue infection over the last few days. Jamnagar till October 16 had reported some 1,099 cases, with the third highest number of cases. Of the 12 dengue deaths that have taken place in Jamnagar, some seven deaths took place over the past nine days. Ahmedabad on the other hand had reported 1,933 cases, of which 946 were reported in the past four weeks. “The sudden jump in dengue cases is because of the extended period of rains in September. But what is worrying is the DenV2 viral strain that is assuming a lethal position in those it infects,” says a senior AMC health official. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Mosquito repellent sales spike in city | Patna News - Times of India,"PATNA: There has been a steep rise in sale of mosquito repellent creams, wipes, roll-ons, coils, mats, vaporisers, sprays and nets in the wake of spurt in dengue cases in the city. Malls and supermarkets are also witnessing increased sale of mosquito repellents. Ghanshyam Kashyap, sales executive of a supermarket store in a mall on Pataliputra-Kurji Road, said the sale of anti-mosquito products has almost doubled. “The alarming rise in dengue cases has made people conscious. The sale of wipes, vaporisers, sprays and other mosquito repellents has quadrupled,” said sales executive of another supermarket on Ashiana-Digha Road. Wholesalers are also witnessing a sharp jump in sale of mosquito repellents. “The demand for mosquito repellents has increased in the last 1-2 weeks. Earlier, people only used to buy anti-mosquito vaporisers. However, they have no started looking for personal care products, such as roll-ons, gel and cream,” said Diwakar Sao, owner of a wholesale shop on Boring Road. One Nafis Ahmed, a resident of Patna City, said, “My brother was recently diagnosed with dengue. I don’t want anybody else in the family to catch dengue virus. Hence, I have stocked mosquito repellents in my house.” As the fears loom, parents are taking extra care to protect their children from dengue-carrying mosquitoes. Sangeeta, a homemaker and resident of Kankerbagh, said, “Children are innocent and they just go anywhere without caring about anything. But I continuously keep an eye on my daughter and don’t let her go anywhere without full-sleeved clothes and anti-mosquito gel.” Ruby Verma, a banker and resident of Saguna Mor, said, “Asking kids to stay at home is not the solution to dengue menace. Therefore, we get bleaching powder sprayed on the premises of our apartment on a regular basis. We have hired a private company for the purpose.” Manorma Devi, a resident of Ram Krishna Puram near Saguna Mor, however, said, “People uselessly worry about everything and go for fancy items like gels and roll-ons. They are unaware of the fact that they can easily protect themselves from dengue-carrying mosquitoes by applying eucalyptus oil and camphor on the skin.” Patna DM Kumar Ravi has already asked authorities of all private and government schools to make it mandatory for students to wear full uniform.

Severe virus strain leading to longer spells of fever in Delhi | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The change of seasons has led to a spate of viral illnesses in the city. In the last week, doctors say the number of patients visiting hospitals with fever, sore throat, cough and general weakness — the characteristic symptoms of viral illnesses —have gone up significantly. “Almost every third patient visiting the OPD has viral illness,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, internal medicine at Max Saket. Usually, fever caused by seasonal viral illnesses subsides in a couple of days. But, the doctors say, many patients are complaining of fever continuing for three to four days. “Multiple viruses can cause fever, sore throat and other symptoms. It is possible that this time influenza A virus, which is relatively more severe, is predominant. This may be leading to a longer spell of fever in patients,” said Dr Arup Basu, senior consultant, department of chest medicine at Sir Ganga Ram hospital. He added that children, elderly and people with co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease should be extra careful. Viruses are transmitted in two ways — through the air and by consuming infected food or water. Common cold, flu and respiratory infections usually spread through air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The best way to avoid catching the infection is to maintain hand hygiene and stay away from an infected person, say doctors. If the fever and sore throat last for more than 48 hours, one should always consult a doctor, says Dr R K Singhal, director of internal medicine at BLK super specialty hospital. Change of seasons also increases the risk of upper respiratory infection and allergy. With the onset of winter, there is wide variation in the day and the night temperature which, doctors say, is most suitable for bacterial growth and transmission of viral infection. “Air pollution, which is on the rise in the city, makes the symptoms of viral illnesses worse and recovery even longer,” say doctors. Next week, Delhi is set to host a marathon run. It is advised that the participants should check the weather forecast and prepare themselves accordingly. “If pollution level is significantly high, those with pre-existing respiratory illnesses may need to reconsider running for long,” doctors advise.

Over 300 Bangladeshis return home from virus-hit Wuhan on special aircraft - Times of India,"DHAKA: Over 300 Bangladeshis on Saturday returned home from Chinese city Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, on a special aircraft and were quarantined in a facility under military and police vigil, officials said. State-run Biman Airlines' Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft carrying 312 Bangladeshis, including 12 children and three infants, landed at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) here in afternoon, Biman spokeswomen Tahera Khondoker said. Khondoker said 15 crew and four doctors were on board the special flight. The evacuees were directly escorted to nearby Ashkona Hajj Camp from the airport, where they would have to stay under medical observation for next 14 days as the time is considered as the incubation period of the virus, a Bangladeshi health ministry spokesman said. According to a report in BD News, seven people suffering from fever were sent to hospital after they arrived from Wuhan. The death toll in the coronavirus epidemic has soared to 259 with total confirmed cases surging to 11,791 in China amid stepped up efforts by a number of countries to evacuate their nationals from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan. The virus emerged in early December and has been traced to a market in Wuhan that sold wild animals. The World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a global emergency on Thursday. Bangladesh foreign minister A K Abdul Momen during a media briefing with Health minister Zahid Maleque on Friday said the returnees were not sick, “but we don't want to take any risk and they must go through the required medical observations”. Malek urged the returnees' relatives not to gather at the camp in the next 14 days, adding that the Directorate General of Health and Army Medical Core were mobilised to take proper care of the evacuees in line with a treatment protocol prepared with WHO guidelines to manage the situation. Officials earlier said army troops were called out to guard the camp alongside policemen to enforce the quarantine so the people returned from China could not come in touch with other people. The evacuees were among estimated 400 Bangladeshis, mostly students, who were stranded in Wuhan. The governments of the several countries, including India, have chalked up plans to return their nationals under special arrangement from Wuhan.

"‘Remain vigilant to keep dengue at bay, don’t panic’ | Patna News - Times of India","PATNA: Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad tells TOI’s Sheezan Nezami in an interview that people should not get panicked despite rise in number of dengue cases in the city as the virus is not deadly. Excerpts: What is the reason behind rise in dengue cases in the city?Accumulation of water is the main reason. Waterlogging in some parts of the city has exacerbated the problem. People should also avoid keeping containers outside their houses such as on balconies or in gardens where rainwater can collect. Tyres and tubes outside the house also provide breeding grounds for Aedes aegypti, the dengue-carrying mosquitoBlood samples of how many patients were tested positive for dengue in the virology lab of PMCH so far this year?Altogether, 1,081 patients were diagnosed with dengue at the hospital till Friday. Over 150 dengue patients have been treated at the PMCH in one month Who are vulnerable to the disease?The disease is not common to any particular socio-economic group. The dengue virus can attack anyone How much does it cost to get dengue and chikungunya tests done at PMCH?We do not charge anything, except Rs 5 as registration fee. As far as private hospitals and labs are concerned, they charge anywhere between Rs 1,200 and Rs 2,200 per sample. At PMCH, we collect the samples between 10am and 5pm from Monday to Saturday. We also test samples recommended by other doctors in our lab. Patients get their reports the next day Is PMCH ready to tackle dengue menace?The number of beds for dengue patients was increased from 35 last year to 75 this year, including 10 beds each in the intensive care and paediatric units of the hospital. We also have sufficient stock of platelets Are all tests free at PMCH?Yes, all the tests are free here. We conduct more than 300 types of tests in PMCH’s pathology department, apart from X-rays Private hospitals are still preferred choices for many. Why so?Modernity has defeated humbleness and free service is considered equivalent to demeaning the personalities of people. Going to expensive private hospitals has become a status symbol for many. Earlier, senior officers and politicians used to get treated in government hospitals. Our chief minister’s mother was admitted and treated here. This trend should continue so that the others could follow it People often complain of rude behaviour by the staff at government hospitals We will soon start a training programme for our staff and encourage them to behave politely with patients and their attendants. A ‘May I Help You’ counter has been opened at the PMCH to assist people What is the inflow of patients in outpatient department (OPD) and inpatient department (IPD) of PMCH?Around 3,000 people visit our OPD daily. Similarly, 500 people visit the hospital’s IPD per day What is the status of the project to make PMCH a world-class hospital with 5,000 beds?Bihar Medical Services and Infrastructure Corporation Limited has initiated the bidding process for the same.

'CDV virus found in 68 lions and 6 leopards too' | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: The canine distemper virus (CDV) infection which killed 27 lions in September-October last year along with babesia infection was detected in a total of 68 lions and six leopards too, according to research by National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The research paper, recently published in the US-based Center for Disease Control (CDC) newsletter, says that samples from 316 lions and 52 leopards were tested. Interestingly, contrary to earlier belief that the CDV virus found in Gir may be an East African strain which wiped off lions in Serengeti, Tanzania, the NIV researchers, who studied the genome sequencing of CDV virus, say it is similar to proposed India-1/Asia-5 strain found in Indian stray dogs. ""We observed 95.8% to 96.8% nucleotide similarity for the 'H' gene region of CDV sequences from the Gir outbreak with the proposed India-1/Asia-5 strain,"" claimed the research team led by director of ICMR-NIV, D T Mourya and his collegues P D Yadav, S Mohandas, A Shete-Aich and R R Sahay. Among co-authors were a several Gujarat forest officials including R F Kadiwar and M K Vala of Sakkarbaug Zoo in Junagadh, Department of Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Gandhinagar, A K Saxena and P Purushothama. The paper proposes vaccination of lions for CDV. ""CDV is prevalent in dog population in India and free ranging dog population often poses a threat of virus transmission to wildlife. Vaccination is an option,"" the NIV paper says. Back in September 2018, ICMR-NIV Pune had received blood and ocular (eyes), nasal, and rectal swab specimens from 229 wild and 87 captive lions. They had also got visceral organs, including lung, liver, heart, and kidney, from three dead lions for investigations. Of the 229 wild lions, 20 had shown clinical CDV infection signs, including dullness, lacrimation, cough, diarrhoea, and seizures. Two of the 87 captive lions showed lacrimation and respiratory distress. In all, 68 lion samples and six leopards had tested positive with CDV.

Patna: 136 dengue cases in a day set the alarm bells ringing | Patna News - Times of India,"PATNA: The blood samples of 136 patients were tested positive for dengue at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on Friday, the highest in a single day since the outbreak of the disease this year. Sachchidanand Kumar, incharge of virology lab at PMCH, told TOI that of the 136 fresh dengue patients, 120 are from Patna. On Thursday, the health department had put the number of dengue patients in Patna at 903, excluding the ones undergoing treatment at private hospitals. If the 120 fresh cases are added to it, the number stands at 1,023. However, according to figures released by the malaria office, Sultanganj, the number of dengue patients in Patna rose from 903 on Thursday to 981 on Friday. The malaria office, which functions from Swasthya Bhavan, has put the number of dengue patients in the state at 1,392. With dengue assuming alarming proportions in the city following the recent heavy downpour and unprecedented waterlogging in several localities of the city, doctors have advised people to take necessary precautions. Dr Anima Xess, professor at microbiology department of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), said people should take precautions to avoid mosquito bite as no vaccine has so far been developed for the dengue virus. Dr Madan Pal Singh, head of medicine department at PMCH, said Aedes mosquito is the carrier of the dengue virus and it primarily bites during daytime. “People should properly cover their body and apply mosquito repellent to prevent mosquito bite during daytime,” he said. PMCH superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad advised people to ensure spray temephos to control disease-carrying insects, including mosquitoes. Temephos is an organophosphate larvicide used to treat water infested with disease-carrying insects, such as mosquitoes, midges and black fly larvae. “One should change water in air coolers at least once a week and also remove water accumulated in the plates kept below flower pots or empty bottles and other things on the terrace,” Prasad said. Shedding light on symptoms of dengue, city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said it includes fever, severe pain behind eyes and fever. “One should keep the body hydrated and take plenty of fruit juice and ORS. In order to reduce fever, one should take Paracetamol, but avoid Aspirin, painkillers and medicines which cause acidity,” he added. PMCH’s medicine department head Dr Madan said one should not get panicked by mere fall in platelets as it was not a life-threatening issue. “Capillary leak, however, is dangerous,” he said. Dr Madan said goat milk and papaya leaves were no way helpful in curing dengue. “These are just myths. One should take plenty of fluid,” Dr Madan added.

Late surge in dengue cases; Kolkata records five deaths so far | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: A late spurt in the number of dengue patients across the city has led to a festival season scare. Several private hospitals have reported a surge in dengue positive cases since late September and the flow of patients continues, which indicates that the virus – which has resulted in five deaths in Kolkata so far – remains active. Even though the symptoms of the virus have been largely ‘muted and manageable’ this year, several cases of ‘expanded dengue syndrome’ – a severe manifestation of the viral attack that affects vital organs including the brain – have been reported from hospitals over the last fortnight, according to doctors. Belle Vue Clinic – which recorded several dengue deaths during the 2017 outbreak – has 22 patients now. There has been a fresh spurt, though the numbers have been far less than the last two years, said CEO P Tondon. “It’s been almost half of what it had been last year. But there has been a late surge and the number of patients has steadily climbed over the last two weeks. But thankfully, none of our patients are serious, which is again a departure from the last couple of years’ trend,” said Tondon. Several patients at Belle Vue were found to be afflicted by the ‘expanded dengue syndrome’ over the last two-three weeks. “This is a severe manifestation but doesn’t lead to haemorrhage or platelet drop. Instead, it affects organs like the heart, liver, kidneys, lungs or the brain. This time, we got several such dengue patients including a couple with cerebral manifestation. They suffered from anxiety, tension, depression and general nervousness even after recovering from the viral attack. But extended dengue syndrome gets more serious if the heart or liver is affected,” said Belle Vue critical care consultant Rahul Jain. He added that the Puja congregations have helped to transmit the virus quickly. Last month, Fortis Hospital received 37 dengue patients. At present, the hospital has seven patients, though none was serious. The frequent spells of shower before the Puja might have helped the fresh spurt, felt internal medicine consultant at Fortis Joydeep Ghosh. “There has been a steady flow of dengue patients since the last week of September. It has continued through the Puja and going by the numbers, it seems that the virus will remain active for at least a month more,” said Biswas. Another private hospital off EM Bypass said it has a substantial number of dengue patients now. “We can’t disclose the exact number but there has been a steady flow of dengue patients since late-September and it continued through the Puja,” said a hospital spokesperson.

"Japan to enforce special virus measures from Saturday, urges citizens against non-urgent China trips - Times of India","By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Elaine LiesTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will bring forward the date that the coronavirus will become a ""designated infectious disease"" and warned its citizens on Friday to put off non-urgent travel to China as a third chartered flight repatriating its nationals arrived from Wuhan.Japan now has 14 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, an epidemic that is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Two of those returned on the first chartered flight and had shown no symptoms.The government classified the new coronavirus as a designated infectious disease on Tuesday, but the designation will take effect on Saturday rather than the original date of Feb. 7. The designation allows compulsory hospitalisation and the use of public funds for treatment, among other measures.Two people on the third flight were taken to medical institutions and several people on the flight had felt unwell, NHK public television said. As worries grew in Japan over a further spread of the disease, the government said it would refuse entry to anyone infected and consider stricter screening for suspected cases, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.""We decided on these changes in view of the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of a global emergency,"" Suga said.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told parliament the government had decided to raise its infectious disease advisory level for China, except Hubei, urging citizens to avoid non-urgent trips to the country. It is already telling citizens not to take any trips to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.The president of Japanese airline ANA Holdings (9202.T) said the company may consider suspending China flights, Jiji news agency reported on Friday. The airline said on Thursday that bookings for flights leaving China fell by half in February.The third flight out of Wuhan, which arrived on Friday morning, brings the total number of repatriated nationals to 565. Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Japan is making arrangements to repatriate all Japanese who want to return from Wuhan and surrounding areas, but that a fourth plane is unlikely to be dispatched this week.The government has come under fire in parliament and on social media over what critics say is inept handling of the returned Japanese, such as allowing two asymptomatic people from the first flight to refuse testing and ""self quarantine"", though by Friday they had consented to tests.Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told a parliamentary committee that Japan was doing everything possible and would change its response if conditions changed.""We still don't know how strongly contagious this is ... we understand that everybody is concerned,"" he said, warning there were limits to what the government could do while still respecting human rights. The government plans to use public facilities, such as training centres, to house the returnees. It may also use a ferry under contract to Japan's self-defence forces. Epidemiologist David Fisman, a professor at the University of Toronto, said although there are more than 90 cases around the world outside China, the number of secondary cases there remains fewer than 10.""That means the reproduction number outside China is currently less than 0.1. Diseases do not spark epidemics unless reproduction numbers are over 1,"" he said.Social media users thought the government steps were insufficient and too late, accusing politicians of focusing too much on political scandals and the upcoming Tokyo Olympics.""Now they say they'll forbid entry to anybody infected? It's way too late for measures like that,"" wrote user Tokyo Taro. ""What is the government doing? Isn't this more important than the Olympics?($1 = 109.7000 yen) (Additional reporting by Ju-min Park and Kiyoshi Takenaka,; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Gerry Doyle)This story has not been edited by The Times of India and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News.(This story has not been edited by timesofindia.com and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.)"
"China ‘isolated’ as virus toll hits 170, number of infected rises to 7,711 - Times of India","BEIJING: China on Thursday raised the death toll to 170 and more countries reported infections from a worrisome new virus, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China’s worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation. Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile (4,184 km) border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1. Train traffic between the countries was halted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air traffic between the two countries continued, at least for now. The Russian foreign ministry said it would stop issuing Chinese citizens with electronic visas as well. Russia has not confirmed any cases of the virus. Meanwhile, South Korea confirmed a case that was locally spread, a 56-year-old who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier. Human-to-human spread of the virus outside China has also occurred in Germany, Japan, Canada and Vietnam, and was a major reason the World Health Organisation has convened its panel of experts on Thursday to assess whether the outbreak warrants being declared a global emergency. The latest figures for China show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,711 confirmed cases worldwide. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. A 38-year-old Chinese woman who arrived in Philippines from Wuhan on January 21 has been confirmed as the first case in the country. A second Japanese flight carrying 210 evacuees landed in Tokyo. Reports said nine of those aboard the flight showed signs of cough and fever. Three of Japan’s confirmed cases were among a group of evacuees who had returned on a flight the previous day. A flight was also en route to China to bring back 350 Europeans. The US said additional flights were planned for early next week after it evacuated 195 Americans on Wednesday. They are being tested and monitored at a California military base. South Korea, Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and other countries were also trying to get their citizens out. Israel’s El Al, Spain’s Iberia, Scandinavian Airlines, Egypt Air and Korean Air joined the growing list of airlines suspending or reducing service to China. Amid reports of shortages in food and daily necessities in hot-spot areas, authorities are “stepping up efforts to ensure continuous supply and stable prices”, the Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited ministry of commerce data showing current reserves in Wuhan can ensure a secure supply of rice and oil for more than 15 days, pork and eggs for more than 10 days and vegetables for five days.

Altered flu virus in ‘stealth fever’ scare | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: An “evolved” form of the influenza virus is on the prowl in Kolkata, and it’s already laid several thousands low over the past fortnight. Medical experts are concerned because this virus can spread easily, and causes a fever that shows almost no symptom, making it more difficult to detect and control. The spread of this virus is being helped by the unusually dry and warm monsoon. While the virus has — so far — neither posed a significant treatment challenge, nor has it exhibited severe forms of discomfort in patients, the city’s medical fraternity is concerned because it’s spreading fast. Unlike the common “season change” influenza, this fever isn’t accompanied by severe discomfort in the form of cough, chest congestion, breathing distress or joint pain. Instead, it has been striking silently, with a sudden bout of high temperature, and disappearing without fuss in three-four days. Experts believe this could be the result of an evolution of the influenza virus, which has been taking on an altered form each year. And the weather is helping it to spread. The virus has been multiplying and spreading fast due to the high humidity, they pointed out. “While we generally come across fever patients with cough and joint pain at this time of the year, this time the fever has been ‘asymptomatic’,” said consultant Arindam Biswas. “It has been characterized by a body temperature of around 100°F, which is remaining constant for three to five days. But the other symptoms have been absent, which is good for patients and easier for doctors to manage. Just paracetamol and rest are enough to deal with the fever, since the acc-ompanying ailments are not there.” While a moderate fever without the associated discomforts is easy to treat, it has caused a change in the diagnosis protocol, forcing doctors to recommend tests to rule out malaria and dengue. “This is dengue season and a fever without symptom could be dangerous,” said Joydeep Ghosh, Fortis Hospital internal medicine consultant. “Thankfully, dengue cases have been few so far, but it still needs to be ruled out first.” He added that viruses have been striking with new symptoms every year and this, coupled with the dengue outbreaks, have made them threatening. “Viruses evolve and this could be a new strain. It doesn’t mean that the conventional influenza won’t return next year,” he said. “While evolved virus strains are not untreatable, they may reduce resistance and make it easier for bacterial infections to strike, especially in the case of young and elderly patients. This could turn fatal, if not treated early. Also, muted viral infections often make it difficult for doctors to identify dengue, which may strike simultaneously. So, even a mild symtomless fever has to be taken seriously and tests done to rule out dengue,” said Ghosh. A vast majority of fever patients this month have exhibited just a moderately high body temperature and nothing else, confirmed AMRI Hospital consultant Debashish Saha. “It has been spreading fast since the prevailing humidity is ideal for the multiplication of viruses. Such symptomless fever is rare in Kolkata, since seasonal fevers are invariably accompanied by co-morbidities. But this year has been an exception,” said Saha. Such epidemics are difficult to control, he added, since viruses get easily transmitted in public places. “Schools, colleges, offices, public transport and even open areas are not safe. Viruses get transmitted through the air, so prevention is difficult. The severity of the fever will depend on the individual’s immune system. Children and the elderly are suffering more due to lower levels of immunity. The rest are recovering in three-four days on an average,” said Saha. Even though less prevalent, the classical influenza, too, is on the prowl. And it has been striking with the usual symptoms, which are often quite severe. “I have had several patients with cough and chest congestion who have had high fever. It is taking about a week to recover, and the symptoms aren’t unusual. Paracetamol is enough to treat this fever, except in a few cases, where bacterial infection necessitated antibiotics,” said virologist Amitabha Nandy. Biswas, too, said he has come across influenza patients with relatively severe symptoms. “They have been fewer in number but fever with cough and cold has not been entirely absent,” he said. “Treatment has to be symptomatic in such cases and antibiotics should be avoided unless there is reason to suspect bacterial infection.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Tests reveal young girl succumbed to Chandipura virus | Vadodara News - Times of India,"VADODARA: Nearly a fortnight after a five-year-old girl died, her blood tests have confirmed that she succumbed to Chandipura virus. This is first death due to the virus reported in the city this season. The girl, who was admitted in a critical condition due to suspected viral encephalitis, had died on June 30. District health officials who had sent the girl’s blood samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune received the results of the samples that were positive on Saturday. The girl fell ill on the night of June 28 after which she was shifted to Gotri Medical College where she was admitted in ICU for two days. According to health officials, the girl was feeling better but late on June 30, she passed away. Her blood samples were taken on June 28 and were sent for tests. “We received the report on July 13,” said chief district health officer Dr Uday Tilawat. Initially, there was confusion as the patient’s address was mentioned as Tandalja in the hospital records. “While we had started preventive actions at Tandalja, the address later came out to be Bhayli area. There too we have carried out all preventive measures as per protocol,” he said. “We have conducted extensive surveillance in the areas and collected sandfly samples,” he said, adding that there is no need to panic as the disease is being monitored closely. The disease spreads because of bite of the sandfly, which is found in houses built with mud and sand. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Goa: Health department expects dip in dengue cases as rain lessens | Goa News - Times of India,"PANAJI: With the monsoon drawing to a close, the directorate of health services (DHS) expects a decline in cases of dengue as well. The vector-borne disease remained active from August to September in the Tiswadi, Mormugao and Salcete talukas, from where the maximum cases were reported. As many as 1,077 cases of suspected dengue were reported in the state till the end of August, of which 141 were confirmed. Deputy director in-charge of the national vector control programme in Goa, Dr Anant Palekar, said the cause of death in four suspected cases had not been confirmed. “The case papers related to all four deaths will be placed before the investigating committee. Only after it gives its verdict will we be able to say with certainty whether the patients in question had in fact died due to dengue,” Palekar said. While a number of suspected dengue cases had been reported in September too, Palekar said data for the whole state would be available in the first week of October. “With the rains receding, we feel there will be a decline in dengue cases,” he said. Palekar also said that letters have been addressed to panchayats and municipalities seeking that they coordinate with the DHS to stem the spread of the disease. “The biggest problem is that people do not keep their surroundings clean, but blame the authorities when they contract the disease,” he said, adding that a retired government doctor had recently summoned a DHS team to remove furniture dumped outside his building complex where mosquitoes were found to be breeding. “The doctor could have easily teamed up with the building’s management to get the area cleaned, but they wanted us to do it,” Palekar said. Citing another case, he said a doctor in the city, who was reported to have been afflicted with the dengue virus, had mosquito larvae breeding in his own house.  “When his son came to visit him, he too began suffering from the disease. Our team subsequently went to inspect the area and found that larvae was breeding in the plates placed beneath flower pots,” Palekar said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Density of Aedes vectors rising alarmingly in Ahmedabad | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Even as Ahmedabad city reels under a dengue scare, now with at least six children succumbing to the deadly virus, a survey by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has revealed that Aedes aegypti mosquito, the prime transmitter of deadly viruses like Zika, deng- ue and chikungunya — is present in an alarming density per room. The highest number of mosquito count per room is in Lambha with 9.75 mosquitoes per room. While Shahibaug and Amraiwadi has mosquito density of over 9, Thaltej and Sabarmati reported density of eight on different days in September. In Vejalpur, Ranip and Jodhpur areas, Aedes aegypti density was more than two per room. In Dariapur, Vatva, Jamalpur and Thakkarbapanagar, the density was more than four per room. In August, the city had registered 199 cases of dengue which increased to 416 in the first 21 days of September. 4 dengue deaths in city in SeptemberThe city also registered six dengue deaths, of which four were in September. The density has not gone down in September as continuous heavy rains have helped mosquito breeding. What is alarming is that in February this year, National Institute of Virology (NIV) had warned health officials to control Aedes aegypti breeding as the Zika virus isolated from Ahmedabad was of a pre-outbreak strain. Even the WHO’s May bulletin has advised AMC to control Aedes aegypti breeding. “Even a single Aedes aegypti mosquito present in homes can prove disastrous. We should understand that sporadic rains and humidity is conducive for Aedes aegypti to breed and hence dengue cases may shoot in October,” says a senior entomologist with the AMC. The entomology department of the AMC has in its report said that overall mosquito density in the city now stands at over 3.90 mosquitoes per room. The survey carried by the AMC established a rise in the mosquito density. The density which was 3.02 per room in July increased to 3.9 in August and was constant in September.

China confirms person-to-person spread of new virus as fourth death reported - Times of India,"SHANGHAI: The Chinese official investigating a pneumonia outbreak stemming from a new coronavirus said the disease can spread from person to person but can be halted with increased vigilance, as authorities on Tuesday confirmed a fourth death. Zhong Nanshan said there was no danger of a repeat of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic that killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak, which started in China, as long as precautions were taken. ""It took only two weeks to identify the novel coronavirus,"" state news agency Xinhua quoted Zhong as saying late on Monday. The outbreak was still in its early stages and China had good surveillance and quarantine systems to help control it, he added. The suspicion about human-to-human transmission has sounded alarm bells in China and neighbouring countries because millions of Chinese are set to travel during the ongoing festival season around the Chinese New Year on January 25. The outbreak was still in its early stages and China had good surveillance and quarantine systems to help control it, he added. The outbreak has spread from the central city of Wuhan to cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with more than 200 cases reported so far. Four cases have been reported outside China - in South Korea, Thailand and Japan. Australia on Tuesday said it would screen passengers on flights from Wuhan amid rising concerns that the virus will spread globally as Chinese travellers take flights abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday starting this week. Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travellers from Wuhan. Chinese authorities confirmed a total of 217 cases of the virus in China as of 6pm (1000 GMT) on Monday, state television reported, 198 of which were in Wuhan. A fourth person died on January 19, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. The 89-year-old man, who had underlying health diseases including coronary heart disease, developed symptoms on January 13 and was admitted to hospital five days later, it added. Zhong, who is renowned in China for his work fighting SARS in 2003, confirmed that the virus can pass from person-to-person. Fifteen medical workers in Wuhan had been diagnosed with pneumonia, with one other suspected case, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition. In Shanghai, officials on Tuesday confirmed a second case involving a 35-year-man who had visited Wuhan in early January, and said they were monitoring four other suspected cases. The virus causes a type of pneumonia and belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as SARS. Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday an animal source appeared most likely to be the primary origin of the outbreak and that some ""limited human-to-human transmission"" occurred between close contacts. The Geneva-based UN agency convened an emergency committee for Wednesday to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it. So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions, but a panel of independent experts could do so or make other recommendations to limit spread.

Nahargarh Biological Park loses third big cat to ‘virus’ in eight days | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: In what could possibly be a case of gross negligence by Nahargarh Biological Park officials, canine distemper virus (CDV) is suspected to have caused the death of a white female tiger on Thursday, taking the death toll of big cats from CDV to three in eight days. The death of the tiger, aged 14-and-a-half-years, assumes significance as the forest department had administered CD vaccines to six lions and six tigers, including the dead one, on Sunday. On September 19, 10-year-old Asiatic lioness Suzanne, which came to the park from Gujarat, had died. Two days later, nine-month-old tiger cub Ridhi, born to tigress Rambha in December last year, died before the vets could attend to it. Sources said that they suspected both the deaths to have been caused by the CD virus, though, in the case of lioness Suzanne, the paralysed hind legs too may have worsened its condition.In a press statement, DFO Sudarshan Sharma said, “The white tigress which died on Thursday was brought from the National Zoological Park, New Delhi, in 2016. The exact cause of the death is yet to be ascertained. To conduct the post-mortem, a team from Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly, has been called. The team will also carry out the medical examination of other wild cats.” According to sources, if the forest officials had taken timely action and assistance from IVRI earlier, the casualties could have been reduced. They also claimed that more deaths of wild cats were likely at the park. Speaking to TOI, IVRI scientists said, “CDV can spread from one animal to another. The infected animal excretes the virus through all bodily fluids, including urine, as well as larvae from the mouth. The virus also spreads if a big cat eats the meat of an infected animal.” Sources alleged that authorities did not take proper precautions after tests by IVRI confirmed that lioness Suzanne had died of CDV. “This disease gets transmitted easily. Since it’s a viral disease, infected air can also cause it. Infected animals should be isolated from other animals in the zoo and put in quarantine for strict disinfection so that it does not spread. It appears that this exercise was not carried out. Due to this, three deaths have happened in over a week. Let’s hope more such deaths do not occur in the park,” said a senior forest official on condition of anonymity. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 New virus in China: Health ministry seeks info on Indian visa applicants from MEA | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In the wake of the outbreak of an infection in China caused by a new strain of virus, the health ministry has sought from the Ministry of External Affairs details of those who have applied for Indian visa since December 31 so that they can be counselled. The MEA has also been requested to disseminate travel advisory to Indian Embassies in China and adjoining countries in local languages for wider circulation and passenger information, the health ministry said in a statement. The Union health secretary has also written to states and Union Territories to review their preparedness, identify gaps and strengthen core capacities in the area of surveillance, laboratory support and in particular, hospital preparedness in terms of isolation and ventilator management of patients with severe respiratory illness. Special secretary, health, on Monday reviewed the public health measures that need to be scaled in the context of spurt in cases reported by China. According to chinese authorities, coronavirus has infected more than 220 people and resulted in the death of three persons in the country. WHO, in its risk assessment, said that the risk for a global spread of the infection remains low. Various measures have been initiated by the Ministry of Health as a matter of abundant precaution and the secretary, health is constantly reviewing the developments, preparedness and response measures being undertaken by the ministry, an official statement said. The health ministry has written to the civil aviation ministry for thermal screening of passengers at the international airports in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin and the airlines to follow International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines for managing and notifying anybody reporting illness on flights originating from China. The Airport Health Organizations at the Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata have put up signs at prominent locations informing the public about self-reporting of illness. Hospitals attached to these airports have been reviewed for provision of isolation and critical care facilities, the statement said. ""The ministry of health has also written to Ministry of External Affairs to provide details of travelers from Wuhan city who have sought visa to travel to India, since December 31 and to counsel the applicants while issuing visa. ""They have also been requested to provide daily details. As for E-visa issue Ministry of Home Affairs is being approached,"" the statement stated. The Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) under the Chairmanship of Director General of Health Services (DGHS) has met twice -- on January 8 and 15 -- to assess the risk and review the preparedness and response mechanisms to manage any case that might get into India. WHO, being represented in the JMG, is providing the ministry with regular updates and technical information. A travel advisory has been put up on the ministry's website and also on the Twitter handle.

Ahmedabad: ‘Sporadic rain means dengue spike’ | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: As the city is battling slow but steady rise in dengue cases this year, experts believe that spells of rain can play a crucial role in deciding how the vector-borne disease in October and beyond will behave. City-based epidemiologist Dr Chitan Desai said that more vigilance is required while treating the water or checking for spots of mosquito breeding this year. “This year, the rain is received in periodic spells — even when you carry out sustained drive and eradicate the mosquito eggs, another spell after a few days can revive the remaining ones,” he said. In an earlier paper ‘Impact of Climatic Fluctuation on Dengue Virus Etiology’ in Journal of Molecular and Genetic Medicine by a team from CHARUSAT in Changa had analyzed the outbreak in 2016 from eight centres in Gujarat and had found that high number of dengue cases was observed when the difference in day and night temperature is above or equal to 2 degrees celsius. The authors had calculated temperature at four times of the day and had found the difference by subtracting the day’s highest and lowest from the number to derive the figure. ‘In January and March this difference is very less, sometimes below 1°C, indicating the role of relatively low night temperature in reducing the dengue instances,’ mentioned the paper. The researchers pointed out two other factors — atmospheric pressure and humidity. ‘The study conducted by other group have shown the large impact of monsoon on dengue incidence, as it is logically connected with the breeding of dengue host in stored rain water. However, In Indian climate, the maximum number of cases was observed post monsoon, suggesting the breeding of vector in stored water in relatively less humid environment,’ mentioned the paper, adding that the most conducive environment is found when the day is warm, night is cool and there is presence of high humidity. ‘The optimal growth rate of epidemics at 33°C implied that many dengue endemic regions would be challenged by increased transmission potential in the future when temperature rises,’ mentioned a study by Joacim Rocklöv and Yesim Tozan published in April this year. The authors also predicted average monthly temperature exceeding 33 degrees celsius in India and African Sahara by 2050. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Ahmedabad: Class XII DPS student succumbs to dengue | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Shockwaves spread through the education fraternity after another child, a class XII students of DPS School in Bopal, succumbed to the dengue virus, which is proving deadly for young students in the city. Sources confirmed that Sreevardhan Dubey, a Class XII student, who was pursuing commerce with maths, succumbed to dengue-related complications on Monday afternoon. “We are saddened by the demise of one of our students to dengue. The student last attended school on September 9 and then was on study leave at home. He had come to school on September 16 to take an exam,” said Unmesh Dixit, officer on special duty at DPS School. Sources said Sreevardhan had got a fever last Monday. When it did not subside, he was admitted to a private hospital on SG Road. He then developed severe complications and finally succumbed. The death comes as another shock for a city reeling from the scourge of dengue. This season has been especially deadly for children, as five children had died due to dengue related complications earlier. According to AMC sources, Manira Qureshi (13) of Behrampura, Hani Patre (12) of Khokhra, Afrinbanu Shaikh (18 months) of Gomtipur, Lokesh Prajapati (4) of Vejalpur and Jay Parikh of Anandniketan School had earlier died due to the virus that is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Doctors say parents need to be especially careful while sending children to school. “Students should, without fail, apply mosquito repellant. They should wear full-sleeved shirts and full pants, to avoid bites of Aedes aegypti, which bites in the daytime,” said physician Dr Manoj Vitthalani.

"Nagpur: Use blood bags with NAT label only, advise experts | Nagpur News - Times of India","NAGPUR: All blood banks and clinicians are aware about the Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), a highly-sensitive method of testing blood that is used to detect Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) and West Nile Virus (WNV) in blood. Many blood banks in India have started the practice of providing NAT-tested blood to recipients. But awareness about NAT is still missing. Those who receive blood bags from banks must know about NAT and they should ask for an electronically-printed report of NAT detection while receiving the blood bag, say experts. NAT is a molecular technique for screening blood donations to reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs) in the recipients, thus providing an additional layer of blood safety. Highlighting the importance of safe blood practices, Dr Rema Menon, in-charge of transfusion medicine at Apollo Hospital, Chennai, who was in Nagpur for IMA’s conference, said that NAT minimizes the risk of transfusion diseases. “NAT test is mandatory, but all blood banks are not equipped with the testing machines. So, there should be a centralized NAT testing centre in every region. All blood banks will benefit from it. This will ensure that patients will get access to NAT blood from any of the blood banks in the region,” she said. Dr Menon also spoke about the two methods of NAT testing. “There are two processes by which NAT test is being done. But, there must be no comparison between these two methods. The circulars issued by regulatory bodies like National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) and National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) clearly state that these two are different testing formats and they should not be compared,” she said. Dr Vijay Kumar Tungar, medical adviser of Dr Hegdewar Blood Bank said that recipients deserve NAT-tested blood and many leading blood banks are providing it in the city. “We have appealed to all clinicians in the city to use NAT blood for an additional layer of safety. The methodology of conducing NAT could be different in different blood banks, but the purpose of the test remains the same. We all want to provide safe blood to patients,” he said.

Goa scores in curbing spread of Japanese Encephalitis virus | Goa News - Times of India,"PANAJI: Goa has fared much better than most Indian states in controlling the spread of the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus. Till May, just one JE case was detected in the state. The patient, a senior citizen, has since been cured. Meanwhile, in Assam, data available with the health department has shown that the JE virus has claimed at least 21 lives in the last three months alone. In 2018, three cases of JE were detected in Goa, two of which were children. “Both children, natives of Odisha, had come from their native state and were residing with their respective families in Quepem. Both the children were treated. One child returned to his home state,” said Dr Anant Palyekar, the state in-charge of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. This year, till date, he said, they haven’t found JE among children. Palyekar said that this year, 37 cases were noted for acute encephalitis syndrome. Since some of the symptoms of JE such as confusion, hallucinations, seizures, weakness and loss of sensation, are common with other illnesses, he said, they could not be ignored. While one case was confirmed, that of the senior citizen, the rest were eliminated after tests results turned out negative. In 2012, there were nine cases of JV detected in Goa. That number reduced drastically to just three cases in following year. Post 2013, there has been a decline in the number of cases. From 2014 and 2017, no case of JE were reported in Goa. While JE is treatable, there can be complications in some percentage of the cases, Palyekar said. Moreover, in case there is a delay in medical intervention, the virus is most likely to leave a residual effect on the survivor, he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Dengue cases up in Tamil Nadu; doctors, health department staff put on alert | Chennai News - Times of India","CHENNAI: With neighbouring states reporting higher number of dengue cases, and fever cases spiking up by nearly 50% within the state, the health department has released an advisory for doctors and local administrators on prevention and early diagnosis of dengue cases. After a review meeting chaired by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday, senior health department officials said the state had about 4,500 fever cases on an average every day, up from the average 3,000. “The spike in fever cases was seen in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Cuddalore in the north, Coimbatore, Salem and Erode in the west. The case load is highest in border areas,” said director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy. As per World Health Organization estimates, about one percent of the population is likely to have fever at any given time. During monsoon and winter, it increases up to 1.5% to 2%. Most of these fevers are common cold and mild seasonal flu. “But dengue, leptospirosis, enteric fever, scrub typhus, malaria and H1N1 also go up. If they are not quickly diagnosed, there can be complications and death,” he said. So far, more than 2,000 cases of dengue and one death have been reported in the state. Officials said test for dengue is done only when the symptoms are severe and patients require hospitalisation. “So, many cases may not have been reported,” he said. The health department has been working with local administration agencies to destroy the habitats for dengue-causing aedes. For instance, Greater Chennai Corporation has been asked to penalise hospitals and institutions up to Rs 10 lakh if they are found to be breeding grounds for aedes mosquitoes. Fines will also be imposed on residential areas, construction sites, educational institutions, and industrial and commercial establishments. Doctors have been advised on how mortality from fevers can be reduced to zero by implementing timely and appropriate clinical management. “Blood samples should be sent for test, paramedical staff should be trained to focus on rehydration and doctors should referral patients to higher centres without delay when there is need,” he said.

Row over dengue fogging in Jaipur | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: Monsoon is almost over, but Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) is yet to kick-off fogging across the city to check dengue and other vector-borne diseases. Though civic officials claimed that they had completed fogging in half of the city by taking help of ward councillors, there were many who rejected such claims. Last year, Jaipur recorded 42% rise in dengue cases in addition to more than 100 people being affected by Zika virus with Shastri Nagar as its epicentre. According to medical experts, there is an urgent need to start fogging in the city to avoid spread of these diseases. JMC medical Soniya assured that fogging had been carried out in more than 50 per cent of the city areas. “We have started fogging in morning and evening shifts. We have deployed a vehicle and two portable machines for every ward. We have involved councillors so that they could guide us to places where fogging is urgently needed,” said Soniya. She added that JMC had focused on Shastri Nagar and areas around Dravyavati River since both these places could turn out to be larvae breeding bases. Though a few councillors said their areas had been fogged, most of them denied. However, a councillor from Shastri Nagar, who did not wish to be named, said no fogging was carried out. “The area that comes under my jurisdiction had never been fogged. We have asked the JMC to carry out fogging in my area,” the councillor said. In the Walled City, where there are hundreds of dirty lanes which are considered breeding grounds for mosquitoes, special attention is needed. Gopal Saini, a resident of Chandpol said, “As monsoon is almost over, mosquitoes have started to breed again. It has become difficult in the evening. We keep our windows closed and have bought mosquitoe repellents. We have asked our area councillor to start fogging, but it hasn’t been done.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Government launches Rota virus vaccine drive | Patna News - Times of India,"PATNA: The health department launched the statewide vaccination drive for Rota virus from Phulwarisharif primary health centre (PHC) here on Wednesday. Health officials said it will be a part of routine immunization drive conducted by the health department for prevention of diseases like polio. “To save children from diarrhoea, Rota virus vaccine has become part of routine immunization schedule. Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the two major reasons for infant mortality in the state and health department is determined to control both the diseases to further reduce the infant mortality rate. Rota virus vaccine will prove to be a milestone in reducing infant mortality rate in the state,” principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar said. Development commissioner Subhash Sharma and executive director of Bihar State Health Society (BSHS), Manoj Kumar, were also present on the occasion. The programme was organized by BSHS in association with Unicef (Bihar). An awareness chariot on dengue and chikungunya was also flagged off on the occasion. Health officials and delegates from WHO, Unicef and CARE were also present on the occasion. “The government has set the target of 90% immunization. Auxiliary nurse midwives, ASHA workers, self-help groups and paramedical staff at PHCs, community health centres and additional PHCs have been trained to achieve the target,” Subhash said and added: “All 633 cold storages in state have been stocked with the Rota virus vaccines.” Manoj said 40% of the children admitted in various hospitals in state suffer from diarrhoea, which mainly occurs due to Rota virus. “Almost 9% of the child deaths below the age of five years is due to diarrhoea. Malnutrition for a long period is also a reason for this. Rota virus vaccine will save at least 33 lakh infants in Bihar from diarrhoea every year,” he said. Altogether 414 crore doses of the vaccine have been administered across 15 states to children. Apart from severe diarrhoea, rota virus infection also leads to high fever, vomiting and stomach ache. Loose motion and other symptoms remain for 3 to 7 days and if not given proper medication, it can lead to severe dehydration and even death.

Construction sites and parks new dengue vector dens | Kanpur News - Times of India,"Puddles dotting construction sites and parks along Kanpur Road and Hardoi Road are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, residents told TOI on Saturday during a reality check on why the number of dengue cases are so high in these areas. Since July, 152 people in the city have tested positive for the vector-borne viral disease and 67 of them or 44% belong to residential neighbourhoods along the two arteries. Also, 37% of the total vector dens identified so far are in these areas. TimesViewThe drive to eliminate Aedes aegypti breeding grounds has not been able to prevent the outbreak of dengue fever this year. Money and efforts will go waste if the authorities allow water to accumulate on vacant plots and at construction sites along Kanpur and Hardoi roads. Such vector dens are also present elsewhere in the city. The department and LMC must work in tandem to sanitise these placesResidents contended that urban expansion was the key reason behind the spurt in dengue fever. The civic authorities, they said, were trying to contain the mosquito population through fogging and anti-larval sprays, but the exercise was concentrated in places where people live. Vacant plots, construction sites and parks are rarely covered during these drives. “Whenever a dengue case is reported, there is a spurt in sanitising activities. However, no follow-up is done,” said Shivam Mishra, a resident of Rajini Khand. Rajesh Kumar of Ruchi Khand, whose brother tested positive for dengue fever in August, said the civic authorities cleaned the area and sanitised homes, albeit for a brief period. “No wonder four more persons had dengue last week. Since repeated requests to the authorities fell on deaf ears, residents are themselves pouring kerosene oil on puddles to kill mosquito larvae,” Kumar said. Three members of Arti Singh’s family suffered from dengue fever in September. “The agencies cleaned up the area and issued notices to households where larvae were found. However, nothing was done against owners of four vacant plots and three construction sites, which are also breeding mosquitoes,” she said. Anupam Bisariya, a theatre artist in Rajajipuram, said three labourers working at an under-construction building in the area contracted the dengue virus this month. “We called the local corporator, but he blamed the owner of the property. We demand that the authorities clean puddles and waterfilled potholes for public safety,” he added. In-charge of the district’s vector-borne disease control unit Dr KP Tripathi said, “Teams will be instructed to eliminate mosquito larvae in parks, construction sites and vacant plots. Owners will be served notices too.” Nagar Swachhta Adhikari Pankaj Bhushan said zonal officers would be asked to clean parks. “Penalty will be levied on owners and contractors who are held accountable,” he added.

Ahmedabad: Do bigger Zika worries lie ahead? | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: A recent World Health Organisation (WHO) bulletin on the Zika virus disease in India, spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, has drawn the attention of epidemiologists to the question of wwhether India’s Zika outbreak in Rajasthan and MP and detection in Ahmedabad and Chennai is part of a pattern of smaller localized outbreaks or the beginning of something bigger? The bulletin points out that prior to the Rajasthan and MP outbreaks last year, there were three Zika virus cases in Ahmedabad in 2016 and 2017, the first in the sub-continent. Low levels of population immunity may therefore be expected, the bulletin states. The WHO bulletin quotes Dr Neena Valecha, director of the National Institute for Malaria Research in New Delhi, “The situation is a matter of concern,” says Valecha, but she is hopeful that the government’s vigorous response, and increased surveillance will be sufficient to track and reduce transmission to a minimum. Zika virus’s risks of causing microcephaly in newborns will be an important focus of India’s Zika response in the coming months, the WHO bulletin states.

Viruses ‘hack’ molecular biological system | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Viruses such as HIV — responsible for AIDS — are difficult to deal with. How they enter human cells and how they multiply and manipulate the human immune system have been studied over the years to find a cure. A new research published in journal 'Scientific Reports' by the Nature Research points at a mathematical model of the spread where the viruses target the nodes for maximum control of the signalling network in human cells. The paper, “Network controllability analysis of intracellular signalling reveals viruses are actively controlling molecular systems”, was recently published in “Nature”. A senior research fellow at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DAIICT), Dr Vandana RaviA new research published in journal 'Scientific Reports' by the Nature Research points at a mathematical model of the spread where the viruses target the nodes for maximum control of the signalling network in human cells.ndran, was one of the lead authors. Other team members included Prof V Sunitha from DAIICT and researchers from Toho University in Japan, University of Glasgow, and University of Manchester in the UK, and IIIT-Delhi. “Human cell is a complex organism. When it interacts with viruses — which can’t live on their own, changes happen at both the sides,” said Ravindran. “The viruses try to hijack the entire system, but how does that happen? Viruses choose the driver nodes in our molecular systems to gain access to the complex network. The principle is known as control theory in data sciences.” The process can be compared to how hackers identify a central computer system and attack it to gain access to a large network of computers to infect it. The team studied the pattern in both HIV and Hepatitis C viruses by carrying out experiments in both infected and normal systems. “The research gives us a peek into the complex system through which the viruses interact with human proteins and the dynamics governing the spread and intensity,” said Ravindran. “Application of this computational biology can be found in drug delivery system and identifying anti-viral targets.” Ravindran is currently a research fellow at The Royal Society as part of two-year Newton International Fellowship under which she got a grant of GBP 91,192 (approximately Rs 82.23 lakh) for her post-doctoral research, “Modelling viral-host molecular interaction using control theory”. The paper argues that a virus efficiently brings the dynamically organized host system into its control by mostly targeting existing critical control nodes, requiring fewer nodes than in the uninfected network. The lower number of control nodes is presumably to optimize exploitation of the sub-system required for virus replication and host response to infection.

More diagnostic centres needed in Telangana: Amicus curiea tells HC | Hyderabad News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: Highlighting the severity of dengue outbreak and growing concerns over the number of cases, the high court was informed that Telangana has just two diagnostic centres in Hyderabad to test and detect diseases like dengue, swine flu and malaria. Amicus curiae S Niranjan Reddy said the time has come to set up eight diagnostic centres across the state to fight the diseases. Asserting that Telangana should not lead a lone battle against dengue and other diseases, he said the state should make use of the expertise of the central government and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Agency (NVBDCA). Stressing the point that only two centres — one at the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) and the other at Government Fever Hospital in Nallakunta — would be of little use to control the spread of the diseases, Niranjan suggested that the number of diagnostic centres should immediately be increased. He was making these suggestions while assisting the court in the hearing of a PIL which challenged the alleged inaction of the government to prevent and control the spreading of dengue, chikungunya, malaria and other diseases. A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy on Friday heard the PIL filed by advocate Rapolu Bhasker Netha. The amicus curiae, in his report, further said the government should coordinate with specialised agencies lile NVBDCA and National Institute of Malaria Research, working under the Union ministry of health and family welfare. Both the ministry and World Health Organisation (WHO) had issued clear guidelines on the diseases and the state should follow them, the senior counsel said. “A comparitive study of steps taken by various governments to control these dreaded fevers could also serve the purpose,” the senior counsel said, citing the example of Punjab, which in coordination with WHO, had developed a micro-strategic action plan for elimination of Malaria between 2018-2020. A specific action plan for swine flu detection and eradication should also be prepared, he said. Niranjan felt there was no coordinated effort among the authorities of various wings to deal with the health problems. All the registered diagnostic centres and doctors should be informed about existing swine flu detection facilities and the protocol to be followed on collection of blood samples, etc. “Early detection will certainly arrest the spread of these vector-borne diseases,” he said. Apart from organising awareness campaigns on mosquito menace, dissemination of information to people and medical fraternity on these diseases was vital both in prevention and treatment, he added. The court had sought assistance of Niranajan to issue certain guidelines to the authorities concerned. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Union health ministry directs Kerala to undertake enhanced surveillance for Nipah virus in animals, livestock and bats | Kozhikode News - Times of India","KOZHIKODE: The Union health ministry has asked the state government to develop a mechanism for enhanced surveillance for Nipah virus infection in animals/ livestock and in bats in the wake of Kerala witnessing Nipah infection for the second year in a row in May- June 2019. The directive has been issued after the tests conducted at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune identified presence of Nipah virus infection in 12 of the 36 Pteropus fruit bats (33%) collected from the districts of Idukki and Thrissur following Nipah infection reported in a 23- year old man this year. The first Nipah outbreak in the state in May 2018 had claimed 17 lives in the districts of Kozhikode and Malappuram. In a letter to state principal secretary (health) Dr Rajan N Khobragade, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary of Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has asked Kerala government to develop a mechanism for enhanced surveillance for Nipah virus infection in animals/ livestock and in bats by the state Animal Husbandry and Wildlife departments respectively for mapping hotspots (areas which have higher risk of infection) and to provide early warning signals to public health authorities. The state government has also been asked to increase fever and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) surveillance in health facilities and capacity building of all concerned. ""The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is also coordinating with the Department of Animal Husbandry and Department of Wildlife for strengthening surveillance in both humans and animals (both domestic and wildlife) with regular data sharing for identifying hot spots and also for detecting early warning signs for planning preparedness and response strategies,"" the letter said. The Centre has also asked to increase awareness among public about the modes of transmission of Nipah virus and the precautionary measures to be taken. This year a 23- year old man hailing from North Paravur was tested positive for the disease.

Fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae- particularly species belonging to the Pteropus genus- are the natural hosts for Nipah virus. Nipah virus can be transmitted to humans from animals (such as bats or pigs), or contaminated foods and can also be transmitted directly from human-to-human. Outbreaks of the Nipah virus in pigs were reported during the initial Malaysian outbreak in 1999.The presence of Nipah virus antibodies have also indicated that dogs, cats, goats and horses were infected during the outbreak in Malaysia, but only if exposed to infected pigs.

In areas where fogging has been carried out, people complained that the insecticide used to kill mosquitoes was ineffective. Others said the fogging squad never followed up the drive, necessary to make the exercise effective. “There should be health officers monitoring the exercise. We don’t know what chemicals are used. Fogging, if done, hasn’t worked,” said Vijay Gupta of Indiranagar. Vikasnagar residents said fogging was done only on the main road. Lanes were left untouched. Jyoti Tripathi of Mahanagar said houses of politicians and bureaucrats alone were being sanitised. Health officer Rawat denied the allegations and said chemicals were being used as per standard norms. “The population density of mosquitoes has reduced this monsoon compared to last year.

Of the 202 malaria cases, 48 were reported in September, 56 in August, 54 in July, 35 in June, eight in May and just one case in April. According to the report released on Monday, 40 cases of chikungunya have also been reported this year. Last year, 2,798 dengue cases and four deaths were recorded by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which tabulates the data on vector-borne diseases in the city. Both the Delhi government and the local bodies have been making efforts to raise awareness on precautions to ensure that there is no breeding of mosquito larvae around them. The Arvind Kejriwal government has started an anti-dengue campaign '10Hafte 10Baje 10Minute' urging people to inspect their house for any standing water. The campaign -- from September 1 and November 15 -- to combat dengue has garnered support from several personalities, including cricket legend Kapil Dev, many Bollywood actors and well-known journalists. During a press conference on Sunday, Kejriwal had said, ""In five years, the number of dengue cases reported have come down by 80 per cent. We have tried to reduce it even further. This year, fortunately, there is no spike in it and it is because all people have come together, from Delhi government to Centre and MCD"". Dengue mosquito larvae breed in clear, standing water while those of malaria mosquito thrive even in dirty water. Doctors have advised people to take precautions and ensure that there is no breeding of mosquito larvae around them. They have urged people to wear full-sleeves and use mosquito nets. Water coolers should be dried up when not in use as mosquitoes carrying dengue virus usually breed there, a doctor said. Cases of vector-borne diseases are usually reported between July and November, but the period may stretch to mid-December. Meanwhile, mosquito-breeding has been reported in at least 1,06,948 households and 90,461 legal notices have been issued this year. Last year, 473 cases of malaria and 165 cases of chikungunya were reported. According to the SDMC, 10 people had died due to dengue in Delhi in 2017, of whom five were not residents of the national capital. Overall, the vector-borne disease had affected 9,271 people in the city in 2017. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
H1N1 death in Thane: TMC intensifies awareness drive | Thane News - Times of India,"THANE: The civic-health department has intensified its campaign to combat H1N1 virus by taking various initiatives like informing people regarding the dos and don'ts to prevent themselves from getting infected with the virus. The civic body has so far recorded around 49 H1N1 positive patients, including two deaths and it was seen that most of these patients were the ones who had travelled out of the city or are high risk patients. Citizens are asked to look out for symptoms of virus - body ache, congestion, breathlessness, loose motion, chest pain, drowsiness, etc. and immediately consult the doctor. Also, it is expected that if they are infected, then they should do a swab test and start medication. ""Some of the precautions that people can take are avoid going to crowded places, wear a mask, wash their hands, get adequate sleep and maintain a healthy diet,"" said Dr Ram Kendre, medical health officer, TMC ""We are doing the swab tests of suspected patients and if the reports are positive, then we are urging them to stay in isolation,"" he added.

"Virar woman third H1N1 casualty this year, 40 positive cases in February | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: A 46-year-old Virar resident died of influenza H1N1 at Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli this week, making her the year’s third casualty of the viral disease from Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). In a clear sign that the respiratory virus is back this year, BMC confirmed it had recorded 40 cases in February from the city. The positive cases detected in 28 days of the last month was nearly double that of all cases in 2018 (25). TOI has learnt that at least six patients have died of H1N1, initially called swine flu, in city hospitals. But, barring one, most were out of Mumbai cases, referred only for medical treatment. The previous two cases were in Palghar and Thane. A BMC official said the suspected H1N1 casualties will be reviewed by the death committee on March 5. Across the state, nearly 30 have died so far. The respiratory infection that starts with cold, cough and fever can progress into a serious life-threatening lung condition if not treated on time. At least 15 states are reeling under the virus’ onslaught, with Rajasthan and Gujarat recording the most deaths. Dr Sujeet Singh, who heads National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi, said cases were coming from all over the country and an extended winter probably had a role. Priyanka Konapalkar (46) succumbed on February 24 at Kasturba Hospital in less than 24 hours of hospitalisation. A relative said she came down with classic flu symptoms about a week before her death. She sought treatment at a local hospital before getting admitted to Virar’s Sanjivani Hospital in a breathless condition. She was put on ventilator support there. “Her condition kept deteriorating. Doctors told us she needed care in a higher centre, so we took her to Kasturba,” said Mayur Merai, a family friend. He added that Konapalkar’s family was given preventive treatment by Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation. Infectious disease consultant Dr Om Srivastava said the virus was very much in the area. “The volume of H1N1 patients doctors are treating has climbed. It is significantly higher than last year. Timely treatment is the key as not everybody requires hospitalisation or ICU,” he said. “Quite a few who got the infection this year had taken the vaccine. A variant of H1N1 is probably circulating. But that number is minuscule, and vaccination is recommended,” he said. A BMC official said civic hospitals have sto cks of oseltamivir. “We last had a spurt in February 2015. We hope with rising temperature cases will go down,” the official said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"In Hyderabad, all four dengue variants bare fangs | Hyderabad News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: Doctors have called for a molecular monitoring of dengue as all the four variants of the virus that are in co-circulation in Hyderabad and other parts of India are likely to emerge into recombinant virus strains posing more danger to people. Viruses are known to exchange genetic material and since all the four strains of dengue virus are in co-circulation there is a risk of emergence of newer potent variants. Already in the last three years a new variant of dengue virus had emerged with a new serotype, making it difficult for doctors to keep dengue under check. The recent spurt in dengue cases is also attributed to changes in genetic make-up of the virus. “There are high number of severe dengue cases in Hyderabad. The problem is found to be more severe in primary infections, particularly in dengue variant-2 virus (Denv-2). There is a simultaneous circulation of all four variants of the virus. This makes the virus hyper endemic,” said Dr Suneetha Narredddy, consultant (infectious diseases), Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad. The strains present in Hyderabad are known to cause severe dengue fevers. The city had a few people getting infections with more than one strain at the same time, she added. Even as the threat of new strains of dengue looms large, a team of doctors at Gandhi medical college and hospital has found co-infection of dengue, chikungunya and salmonella (typhoid) in patients. Almost one in two dengue patients in Hyderabad suffer from co-infection and in such cases, they need simultaneous medicare. In the last three years researchers have found emergence of a new strain (clade D of dengue virus type 4). Also, a new genotype of dengue virus-4 has been isolated. Doctors warn that presence of all four variants (serotypes) of dengue virus will result in secondary infection, making matters worse. The dengue virus-4 has emerged as the most potent of the four variants, doctors said. Senior physician Dr Syamala Aiyanger said during an epidemic, multiple strains can circulate. Infection with one strain usually gives lifelong immunity against that strain, but only transient or brief immunity against other strains. This cross immunity is only partial. So, a person infected with one strain remains vulnerable to others and can be infected by all during their lifetime. A research study by a team from department of microbiology, Gandhi medical college and hospital, revealed that some of the dengue patients were also suffering from chikungunya and a few others showed triple co-infection with chikungunya and typhoid. About 44% of the people, studied as part of the research, had acute dengue, 29% had chikungunya and 15% had typhoid. It also revealed that one in eight dengue patients was also suffering from chikungunya, one in 16 had chikungunya and typhoid and one in 20 patients had typhoid and dengue. “The drastic increase in dengue infection could be partly attributed to geographic expansion of the vector (mosquito) due to increasing urbanisation, unavailability of specific antiviral therapies, licensed dengue vaccine, and poor understanding of the host immune responses,” said RA Khan from department of biotechnology and bioinformatics, University of Hyderabad, in his research study that unravelled the role of a protein (dengue virus EDIII) in the spread of dengue. The UoH study could also help in development of new drugs to fight the dengue menace. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Dengue outbreak: DMC urges people to not panic | Dehradun News - Times of India,"DEHRADUN: In view of the rising dengue cases in the city, Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) officials held a press conference in the DMC premises on Friday to urge Doonites to not panic.

Third dengue den found bang on KGMU campus | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Larvae of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is a carrier of the deadly dengue virus, were found at TG Hostel on King George's Medical University (KGMU) campus on Thursday, a day after a vector den was spotted in the parking lot of the cardiovascular and thoracic surgery department. This is the third time since July that an Aedes breeding ground was found at KGMU, which has been served three notices in three months, while an employee also tested positive for dengue fever on Wednesday. The warning signs notwithstanding, the university seems to be doing precious little to contain the sting menace. Spokesperson for KGMU Sheetal Verma told TOI that the university was looking into the matter. ""Instructions have been issued to sanitation workers to clean every corner of the campus. They will also identify spots where water is accumulating (in unused or abandoned containers) and submit reports,"" she said. Apart from the medical institution, where the mosquito larvae were found breeding in coolers, the health department has red-flagged 32 other spots in the city that are conducive to Aedes breeding. Notices have been slapped on all the 33 places, eight of them prominent addresses. Additional chief medical officer DK Bajpai said the health department's drive would continue till October.

"West Rajasthan on alert after Congo fever in Pakistan, Gujarat | Jaipur News - Times of India","JAIPUR: An alert on Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been sounded in western Rajasthan as border areas in Pakistan and in Gujarat have reported Congo fever cases in increased numbers. Even the Centre is keeping an eye on the fever. The Centre has sent a two-member team of National Centre for Disease Control, which reached Jodhpur on Thursday to assess the situation. The border districts such as Jaisalmer are also on alert. “We have issued directions to all our officials to remain alert on CCHF. Doctors have been told to remain alert if a patient with CCHF-like symptoms comes to them for treatment,” said Dr BK Barupal, chief medical health officer, Jaisalmer. CCHF is a disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. A 32-year-old person, resident of Molana Azad Nagar, was suffering from CCHF-like symptoms went for treatment to a registered medical practitioner on August 14. He did not get relief and went to government-run MDM Hospital. Following that, he rushed to Ahmedabad for further treatment, where the doctors took his sample and sent it to National Institute of Virology in Pune, where he tested positive for CCHF. Claiming that the situation is under control, the health department sent a team headed by Dr Praveen Aswal, nodal officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) to Jodhpur, which has returned to Jaipur. “The team conducted the survey and found two more persons with symptoms of CCHF from the same family of the 32-year-old person.

Chandipura virus:  Chandipura virus: NIV paper raises alarm on male sandflies | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat’s health department should be worried before the next cycle of Chandipura virus infections strikes. A recent paper published by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, has reported Sergentomyia species of sandflies and especially the male of the species to be potential vector for the rapid spread of the disease. Already two children have died due to encephalitic illness or inflammation of the brain, caused by the Chandipura virus this year in Rustampura village in Vadodara district in July. NIV researchers Rekha Damle, Vasudha Sankararaman, Vandana Bhide, Vinayak Jadhav, Atul Walimbe, and Mangesh Gokhale had analysed 277 sandfly species collected from Dahod, Vadodara and Panchmahal districts. The report says, “This is probably the first report from India of male sandflies testing positive for the CHPV genome.” It adds further, “Positive male sandflies have been reported in Pakistan and Iran. This finding signifies vertical transmission of the Chandipura virus among sandflies, which facilitates the establishment and spread of the disease.” The NIV warning now requires the Gujarat veterinary department to intensify vector control measures in stables, cowsheds and store houses in rural houses, especially those which are made of mud and may host the sandflies within crevices. Between July and August this year, Dahod, Panchmahals and Vadodara districts reported a total of six Chandipura virus cases. An internal report prepared by the state’s health department, has reported these cases from Rustampura village, and one case each at Malnahudi Faliya, Tekar Falyu and Balisana in Panchmahals district; and Belisana village in Zalod taluka of Dahod. Each time these cases were detected, kuccha homes — usually made of mud — within 100 metres of where the virus struck are being dusted with malathion to kill sandflies, which live in cracks in cattle sheds and generally bite humans at night. In the tribal district of Panchmahal, according to the state government report, there were five deaths reported in 2009, four in 2010, and a single case and no deaths in 2013.

Vector fight fails to take off amid blame game in Lucknow | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Dengue fever is stalking the city, but its health and hygiene guardians seem too busy in their little slugfest to contain a looming outbreak. The district health department and the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) had promised to launch a coordinated attack on the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the dengue virus, from September 2. Forty-eight hours have lapsed since, but spraying of larvicides and fogging that can eliminate vector breeding dens haven’t been done. Almost as a reminder of institutional inefficiency, five more persons tested positive in the city on Tuesday. The health authorities and LMC had worked in tandem in July, which saw eight dengues cases. In the absence of a coordinated exercise in August, the last week of the month alone saw 14 cases. That jolted the two government agencies out of slumber. They quickly pledged a joint drive from Monday only to renege on the promise, leaving citizens at the mercy of the virulent virus. Health officials claimed that at a meeting on Friday, it was decided that the LMC would provide a team each in all the 110 wards of the city for the drive. “The LMC did not fulfil its commitment,” said DK Bajpai, additional chief medical officer, Lucknow. Civic officials said the health department never asked them for manpower in writing. “We cannot deploy teams without a formal letter of request.

Mysuru scientist tests formulation to tackle papaya virus | Mysuru News - Times of India,"MYSURU: The fructification of a city-based scientist’s decade-long research is bound to enrich the fruit of many a farmer’s labour, quite literally – Vasanth Kumar Thimakapura’s plant-based eco-friendly formulation is being touted as the preventive remedy against the much-dreaded Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PRV), a bane for ryots dependent on the horticulture crop for their fortunes. Papaya is a biennial crop, and affliction by PRSV is a commonly reported problem in South Karnataka. Thimakapura averred that the formulation he has come up with is non-toxic, and can help control the spread of virus in other crops such as beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, orchids among others. President of the University of Mysore Old Students’ Association, and director of the technical wing of Green Lifescience Technologies, Thimakapura was determined to come up with a remedy for PRSV, a pestilent menace that is found across the world. For Thimakapura, the greatest reward for his work has been the results that farmers have reported after using his formulation for the past two years. “It has already been tested by farmers across India. This is besides many of the in-house trials that we have conducted,” said the scientist. What sets the formulation – Thimakapura has named it ‘PowerPlus’ – apart is that it helps prevent the onslaught by the virus, and can help cure those plants blighted by it. Unaffected papaya plants in his plot growing beside those affected by PSRV, Thimakapura said, attested to the efficacy of his formulation. “The virus has the potential to trigger an epidemic. As of now, there is no variety of papaya that is resistant to the virus, nor is there a foolproof mechanism that can help protect them from its threat. So, I hope that my product will serve as a boon for farmers,” he said. Consequences of virus infectionStunted growth, and lack of fruit-breaking ability are two of the most disastrous consequences of affliction by the Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PSRV) in papaya plants. Fruits borne by plants infected by the virus often exhibit clear signs of the disease: These include a discernible change in its taste, bumps and characteristic ring-shaped spots on the skin. PSRV spreads through an insect vector at an exponential rate, and all it takes for an entire plot to grow infested is a small clutch of PSRV-blighted plants. “Farmers dread it because it is impossible to contain its spread,” Vasanth Kumar Thimakapura said.

Rajasthan: Suspected Congo fever virus samples sent to Pune for test | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: Samples of suspected cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus will be sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for test as there is no such facility available at government’s hospital in the state. It is quite challenging for the health authorities to diagnose CCHF cases clinically as it has more or less same symptoms of dengue and scrub typhus, which are quite common in the state. Acknowledging that CCHF has epidemic potential, the health department has started taking measures for its diagnosis and treatment. Ribavirin is a medicine, which is effective in treatment of CCHF, but it is unavailable in most of the parts of the state. However, the health department claimed that in Jodhpur, they have made Ribavirin available where one case of CCHF has been diagnosed and two other suspected cases are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Ahmedabad. “We have it in Jodhpur and it is also available in market in Jaipur,” said the official. Moreover, after a 32-year-old person tested positive for CCHF from Jodhpur’s outskirt’s area, the health department has alerted all the officials across the state on CCHF and other zoonotic diseases. “Since CCHF, dengue, scrub typhus and other such diseases have similar symptoms, it is quite difficult to diagnose CCHF clinically. So, we have directed the officials to conduct test of dengue and other seasonal diseases first to rule out them first. If the patient tests negative for seasonal diseases, we will take it as suspected case of zoonotic disease,” said the official Besides, the health department is conducting door to door survey in the CCHF affected areas. On September 2, the health department has issued directions to all the chief medical health officers across the state for conducting anti-larvae activities for preventing spread of vector-borne diseases including fogging. The animal husbandry department has also been roped in to tackle the menace of zoonotic diseases. They are conducting activities to kill ticks as CCHF and other such diseases are transmitted from infected ticks to healthy livestock and from livestock, it is transmitted to humans.

"‘Zika risk underplayed, can prove fatal’ | Ahmedabad News - Times of India","AHMEDABAD: Next month, it will be a year since Ahmedabad reported a single Zika case; it was detected in Amraiwadi in October 2018. That year, Gujarat’s neighbours Rajasthan and MP recorded a major Zika virus outbreak and together accounted for 300 cases. Four experts now warn that the “the next large Zika virus epidemic may be taking off in India.” Zika virus is dreaded for causing microcephaly in newborns and is largely spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. A study published in the May edition of the journal called ‘Cell’ warns against being complacent about a single research conclusion from Chinese Academy of Sciences professor L Yuan, who had studied a single mutation responsible for microcephaly. TimesViewLast year in October there were two major Zika virus outbreaks in neighbouring states Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Recently reputed scientific institutions have forewarned presence of both Asian and African Zika viral strain in the country. With these factors in mind health authorities should begin large scale Zika awareness drives among vulnerable pregnant women population. In Ahmedabad, which has been the epicentre for Zika outbreak in India, there are 1.2 lakh pregnant women with the civic authority’s surveillance system. It is an irony that government public display boards are yet to caution public against Zika prominently along with dengue and chikunguniya. The ‘Cell’ study said of the interpretation of Yuan’s work: “It appears to be misleading Indian public health officials into believing that ZikV in India is not dangerous to fetuses, thereby creating a situation where pregnant women may not be properly supported and educated on ways to protect themselves.” The ‘Cell’ report, in fact, has quoted five recent studies that suggest that ZikV strains without the S139N mutation can cause birth defects. By December 2018, nearly 100 pregnant women were reported to be infected with ZikV in India. The first three ZikV cases, which included two pregnant women, were reported from Ahmedabad between November 2016 and February 2017. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, common in homes, also spreads dengue and chikungunya viruses. The strong cautionary message comes from global disease experts of America’s Yale School of Public Health, Bangalore’s Centre for Ecological Sciences of Indian Institute of Science, Australia’s infectious disease research team, and Brazil’s Centre Instituto Goncalo Moniz. The experts’ research states, “Putting too much onus on a single mutation could enhance a crisis in India.” Last year, Indian public health authorities, the study states, had “sequenced five Zika virus isolates from Rajasthan and concluded that the virus cannot cause microcephaly unless the virus has mutation.” The research paper was authored by Professor of epidemiology (microbial diseases) Albert Ko and Nathan D Grubaugh of Yale, Farah Ishtiaq of Indian Institute of Science, and Yin Xiang Setoh of school of chemistry and molecular biosciences, Queensland University, Australia. The study concludes that “Not only should we be vigilant about the threat of future ZikV spread, but also of the spread of misinformation that could put many vulnerable populations at risk.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

With the detection of a swine flu case in Bijnordistrict, health department has directed its staff to be alert while dealing with patients suffering from fever, cough and bodyaches, which are also symptoms of other forms of flu. At the same time, 67 beds have been reserved for the patients here. A team of health department visited the colony where woman resides. The team conducted a check-up of the residents on Friday. The case came to the fore after Meerut’s CMO wrote to his Bijnor counterpart, Vijay Yadav, informing him that the patient had tested positive for swine flu and suggested that he look into the matter. TOI has learnt that the 53-year-old woman is a resident of Saket colony and was admitted to Meerut’s Metro Hospital for treatment. She has a history of lung ailment for the past five years. A few days ago, she came down with fever and was admitted to the Meerut hospital. When the Meerut heath department came to know about her condition, it sounded the Bijnor administration on Friday. According to Bijnor CMO Vijay Yadav, “We have reserved 67 beds in the district hospital and community health centres to deal with this disease and put our staff on alert. A rapid response team was sent to the colony concerned to check the other residents. I have instructed my subordinates to launch an awareness programme about this contagious viral disease in the district.” According to officials, the term swine flu refers to influenza among pigs. Occasionally, pigs transmit influenza viruses to humans. In early 2009, scientists recognized a particular strain of the flu virus, known as H1N1. This virus is actually a combination of viruses from pigs, birds and humans. During the 2009-10 flu season, H1N1 virus caused respiratory infection among humans. In August 2010, the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic. The signs and symptoms of swine flu are similar to those of infections caused by other flu strains and can include fever (but not always), chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, watery red eyes, body ache, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Flu symptoms develop in about one to three days after one is infected. The virus spreads from person to person either by inhaling it or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus (in the form of infected droplets that are expelled into the air through coughing or sneezing). It is not fatal but children, pregnant women and the elderly are at risk from H1N1 virus for it can lead to complications and death. Health department has advised that to protect oneself from contracting swine flu, one must cover one’s nose and mouth in crowded areas, wash hands frequently with soap and water, avoid touching one’s eyes, nose or mouth and avoid contact with sick people.

Deadliest virus in history threatens global pork industry - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A deadly pig virus that jumped from Africa to Europe is now ravaging China’s $128-billion pork industry and spreading to other Asian countries, an unprecedented disaster that has devastated global food chains and has prompted countries to slaughter millions of pigs. Prices are expected to soar from the food markets of Hong Kong to American dinner tables . Outbreaks have been reported in Vietnam, Mongolia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, and also China — the world’s biggest pork producer and consumer. Checkpoints, sniffer dogs and strict import bans have been deployed in a desperate bid to control its spread. But the disease has already hit most provinces in China, reducing pork production by 30% according to some. CAN THE VIRUS AFFECT HUMANS?While the virus doesn’t harm humans even if they eat tainted pork, the fatality rate in pigs means it could destroy the region’s pork industry. BOOST FOR BEEF & POULTRYExports of these meats are on the rise as suppliers scramble to fill the deficit in a pork-hungry region. DAIRY COWS FOR BEEF?Some reports have claimed that China’s farmers may have started slaughtering their own dairy cows for beef. WHO’S IMMEDIATELY AFFECTED?Countries like China, Vietnam, S Korea, Japan, Taiwan, N Korea, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Mongolia. The US is also soon expected to feel the pinch — likely around Christmas when people buy holiday hams. CAN IT BE CURED?Despite 50 years of research, there’s no vaccine for it, and it might take decades to develop one. ""It’s spreading like wildfire in Asia because... the pig is the garbage truck of Asia,"" says Simon Quilty, Australia based meat and livestock quality analyst. A whopping 1 million pigs have been killed since the first outbreak in China in August last year, a number widely considered an underestimate. On the other hand, Vietnam has culled 2 million pigs, 6% of its swine population. China has also experienced 40% surge in pig prices year on-year. An estimated 200 million pigs could be culled in China — more than half its swine population. The country supplies around 50% of the world’s pork.
