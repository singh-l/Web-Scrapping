Maharashtra Zilla Parishad Election Results: BJP loses zilla parishad in Nitin Gadkari and Fadnavis' home turf | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: In a jolt to former CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari, both of whom are from Nagpur, BJP has suffered a defeat in the Nagpur zilla parishad polls, results of which were announced on Wednesday. Of six zilla parishads in Maharashtra for which elections were held on Tuesday - the first since the NCP-Cong-Shiv Sena coalition came to power - the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi won 4. The Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi retained control over one (Akola) while BJP wrested one (Dhule) from Congress. Three of the four zilla parishads won by the MVA - Nagpur, Palghar and Washim - were earlier with BJP; the fourth, Nandurbar, was with Congress. BJP, however, emerged as the party with the maximum number of seats. Of the total 332 seats, it won 103 (as against 74 in the 2013 polls), while the Congress tally dropped from 100 to 73 and NCP's from 53 to 46. Sena's numbers rose from 36 in 2013 to 46. BJP loses in Gadkari’s & ex-mantri’s villagesBJP was tied with the ruling Congress at 23 seats in Nandurbar, where Congress has traditionally been strong, but lost out due to the MVA alliance. Contesting the polls together in a pre-poll pact against BJP helped the ruling coalition secure a win big. In the Nagpur ZP, BJP nominees lost to Congress candidates from Dhapewada and Kamptee, the villages of Gadkari and former energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. Both Gadkari and Fadnavis had campaigned extensively in the entire district. BJP won 15 seats as against 22 in 2013 while Congress 30 as against 19 earlier, NCP 10 compared to 7 earlier, and Sena 1, when it had won 8 earlier. Salil Deshmukh, son of home minister Anil Deshmukh, won the zilla parishad election from hometown Katol, represented by his father in the state assembly. State NCP president and water resources minister Jayant Patil said the results showed this was the beginning of the downfall of BJP. ""It's time for Fadnavis and Gadkari for self-introspection. Not only people of Nagpur, but elsewhere in the state too, people have rejected BJP,"" Patil said. State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat had taken the lead in contesting the ZP elections under the MVA banner and had set up a coordination committee under Sena's Aaditya Thackeray. ""The outcome of the zilla parishad elections shows people have lost faith in BJP,"" Thorat said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Maharashtra: Shiv Sena changes its stripes, steps out of Matoshree for parleys | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena is eager to alter not only its political agenda, but also its style of functioning, as it holds power-sharing talks with NCP-Congress, said analysts on Wednesday. Gone are the days when politicians of every hue—LK Advani, Sharad Pawar, Sushama Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Pramod Mahajan, Vilasrao Deshmukh as well as Rajinikanth—would trek to Matoshree to pay court to Balasaheb Thackeray, or hold political parleys with him. Pranab Mukherjee, accompanied by Pawar, too had visited Matoshree to seek Sena’s support during the 2012 Presidential election, analysts pointed out. But over the last week, the trend has changed as the Sena snapped ties with the BJP and began to build bridges with NCP-Congress to win the CMship following the assembly poll results. On Monday, Uddhav Thackeray met Pawar at Taj Lands End in Bandra to discuss the modalities of forming the NCP-Sena-Congress regime in Maharashtra—something unheard of during the high noon of the BJP-Sena alliance, said party watchers. Moreover, Sena emissaries have begun to fly to Delhi to hold negotiations with either Ahmed Patel or Amit Shah. “From Dadar (where Sena Bhavan is located) to Delhi, the Thackerays have come a long way,” remarked a Sena chronicler. On Wednesday too, Uddhav held meetings with senior Congress leaders, including Ahmed Patel and former CM Ashok Chavan, at Trident in BKC. Pawar’s residence Silver Oak and the YB Chavan Centre at Nariman Point were the other hubs of the hectic parleys. Uddhav also held telephonic talks with Sonia Gandhi in a bid to extract support of her party’s 44 MLAs, his first direct contact with the Congress leader who was routinely slammed by Balasaheb and Saamna for her Italian antecedents, added the Sena leader. “The Sena’s jet has at last touched the ground. The party has realised that it will have to stand at the doorstep of the NCP-Congress if it needs their backing to occupy the CM’s post,” said a senior BJP leader. Recalling that BJP national president Amit Shah had visited Matoshree twice during the Lok Sabha polls in April, he said, “Pawarsaheb and Ahmed Patel won’t make a beeline to Kala Nagar even if they need Sena’s backing.” “Devendra Fadnavis indulged Uddhav Thackeray to a great extent during the last five years chiefly to ensure that the saffron government had a smooth sailing in the state. But Thackeray will have to adhere to protocol and niceties with his new friends. He should learn the rules of the game,” the BJP leader added. Fadnavis would often spend time with the Thackerays at Matoshree, chatting up Aaditya on the sidelines about sports, music and books, it is learnt. In contrast, Pawar is a hardnosed pragmatist who goes by the book, said his NCP colleagues. “Pawarsaheb wouldn’t indulge his political allies beyond a point. Political negotiations are held in a formal, yet cordial atmosphere, measure for measure,” said a Pawar confidant. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
BMC pulls down Sainiks’ chief minister dream banners | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Days after the saffron allies fell out, the BMC has pulled down illegal hoardings and banners at Bandra (East) put up by Shiv Sena supporters that expressed their desire to see party chief Uddhav Thackeray occupy the chief minister’s post. Sena is the ruling party in the BMC. The BMC has called it “routine work” and Sena leaders too have downplayed the action. The illegal posters and banners were put up on the footpath and the road divider outside Shiv Sena chief’s housing society at Kalanagar in Bandra (East). BMC officials said there was no specific complaint regarding the hoardings and that they acted on their own. Many a times, politicians and their supporters put up illegal hoardings and posters to please their leaders. The Sena split with the BJP over the chief minister’s post. On Wednesday, Sena corporators downplayed the issue. Sena mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar said, “It must be routine BMC work.” Many a times, illegal posters cover traffic signal indicators, causing inconvenience to motorists. The BMC had removed 21,699 such hoardings and banners between January and October, over 60% of which were of political parties. A few days ago, MNS secretary Sandeep Deshpande was arrested along with three party activists for allegedly preventing BMC officials from removing his party hoardings put up at Shivaji Park for Diwali. They were released on bail later. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Drought concessions for rain-hit parts: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis | Pune News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday asked the administration to extend the concessions that drought-affected areas get to the areas affected by unseasonal rainfall.  In drought-affected areas, the state government gives concessions like waiver of electricity bills for farmers, revenue tax collection waiver, waiver of examination fees for students from affected areas, free state transport bus travel to students and a stay on the recovery of agriculture loans from affected farmers. Fadnavis chaired a meeting with guardian ministers in the state to review the damage caused by unseasonal rainfall.  The Shiv Sena has been at loggerheads with the BJP over government formation after the poll results in the state last month and has demanded that the government announce a blanket relief of Rs 25,000 per hectare for affected farmers. ""The situation is very grim in these areas,"" Shiv Sena politician Ramdas Kadam said. Uddhav Thackeray has been touring some of affected districts and had sent suggestions that his ministers tabled in the meeting. Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said that of the 70 lakh hectares believed to have been damaged, surveys have been completed on 60 lakh hectares. The state has already sanctioned 10,000 crore for relief to farmers. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra elections: No new deal with the BJP except for 50:50, says Sanjay Raut | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Sanjay Raut, Sena MP and Saamna executive editor, said on Wednesday that the party had got no proposal from the BJP on government formation and again dismissed the possibility of the Sena reaching any new agreement with the BJP except the “50:50” formula that was “agreed upon” prior to the polls. Raut also met Sharad Pawar again on Wednesday, his second meeting with the NCP chief in two weeks. He clarified it was a courtesy meeting. “He (Sharad Pawar) is a senior leader of the state and the country. He is worried about the political situation in Maharashtra today. We had a brief discussion,” Raut said. Later, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Hussain Dalwai held talks with Raut at the Saamna office in the city. “There should be no BJP CM in Maharashtra,” Dalwai told mediapersons. Dalwai had last week written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi saying the party should support a Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra. “The Congress and NCP should take all necessary steps to keep the BJP out of power. I had a very positive discussion with Raut,” he said. Raut said the BJP was free to meet governor B S Koshyari whenever they wished to. Senior BJP leaders are slated to meet the governor on Thursday. “We met the governor. The Republican Party of India leader Ramdas Athawale also met him. And if BJP leaders are meeting the governor (to stake claim to for m the gover nment), then they should for m the gover nment as they are the single largest party,” Raut said. “We have been saying all along that the BJP, being the single largest party, should form the government,” he added. Responding to Pawar’s statement asking the BJP and Sena to form the state government at the earliest, Raut said, “He is right. The party with 105 MLAs should form the government.” Raut also claimed again that there was a “consensus” between the BJP and his party before the assembly elections on sharing the chief minister’s post. No fresh proposal has been received from the BJP or sent to it from the Sena, he added. To a question on when there would be a consensus on the chief minister’s post, Raut said, “There was a consensus on the chief minister’s post before the elections.” Raut has come in for strong criticism from the pro-RSS and pro-BJP daily Tarun Bharat from Nagpur. The paper has accused him of being the Sena’s “parrot” and of being reckless in his statements. CM Devendra Fadnavis had, after the election results, accused Saamna, edited by Raut, of derailing saffron talks and ties. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Sharad Pawar: Keen to see Amit Shah skills in govt formation | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Reiterating that the mandate for his party was to sit in the opposition, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said on Wednesday that the BJP-Shiv Sena combine should take the lead and form the government as early as possible to avoid a constitutional crisis in the state. Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who had met Pawar last week,   visited the NCP chief again   at his residence on Wednesday. Asked about Raut’s claim that the Sena had the support of 170 legislators, Pawar said he was not aware how Raut had got the figure of 170. “Raut has been meeting me quite regularly, but so far there has been no proposal from him on government formation, particularly a Shiv Sena-led government.” No talks between Mohan Bhagwat, Uddhav Thackeray yet: Sanjay RautLive updates: Maharashtra govt formationWhile Pawar, responding to theories about the NCP-Congress supporting a Sena-led government, said the decision would have to be a “collective” one as NCP and Congress had jointly contested the assembly elections, Congress leader and former CM Ashok Chavan said the general consensus in his party was that “all-out efforts should be made to keep the BJP out of power.” Pawar said, “Sena and BJP had contested the elections jointly. The saffron combine should form the government as the mandate is in their favour. We were unable to secure a clear majority, and we have been given the mandate to sit in the opposition. We will play the role of a constructive opposition.”   Read also: BJP to call on governor, Uddhav to meet Sena MLAs  Asked if the NCP would form the government with support of non-BJP parties, Pawar said that as of now, there was no possibility as NCP did not have the required numbers. “In a house of 288, we require 144 for formation of government. With just 54 legislators, it will not be wise to stake claim to form the government. But we will wait till the end, I do not know what will happen tomorrow,” he noted. When mediapersons said BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah had not yet come to Maharashtra for government formation, Pawar said he was keen to see his skills in government formation. “Shah is a troubleshooter and in the past, he had visited a few states during government formation. But he is yet to visit Maharashtra,” he said. Sanjay Raut says BJP should stake claim to form government, show majorityA few days ago, Pawar added, he had had a meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in which he briefed her on the political impasse in the state. “I was to meet Sonia Gandhi soon again, but as of now, there is no agenda to meet her,” Pawar said. Ashok Chavan said the political situation in Maharashtra was very fluid and it would be difficult to predict what would happen. “First the Sena will have to come out of the coalition, then the Congress and NCP will have to sit together and decide the future course of action,” he said. Asked if many Congress legislators had sought permission to extend outside support to the Sena, Chavan there was no such proposal, but the general view was that the BJP should be kept out of power. “As Pawar said, we are not in a position to form the government, and the mandate for us is to sit in opposition. We will play that role effectively,” Chavan said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Punjab Police secure Budda's extradition from Armenia | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab Police is set to arrest gangster Sukhpreet Singh Dhaliwal alias Budda from the Delhi airport after securing his extradition from Armenia. Budda was scheduled to land around midnight at Delhi airport and would be taken into custody by a team of Punjab Police, said DGP Dinkar Gupta. The chief of the Davinder Bambiha gang, Budda was wanted in more than 15 criminal cases, including murder, attempt to murder, extortion and under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in Punjab and Haryana. Budda had claimed responsibility on his Facebook account for the elimination of Maninder Pal Bittu, an activist of Dera Sacha Sauda who was murdered inside Nabha jail. He is also said to be in contact with pro-Khalistan elements. He was also allegedly behind the extortion and threat calls to famous Punjabi singer and actors, including Gippy Grewal, and businessmen. A well-known Punjabi singer, Karan Aujla, was also attacked in Canada on the directions of Budda. Budda was convicted in a 2011 murder case, but had jumped parole in 2016 and was declared a proclaimed offender. Budda, a resident of Moga, had fled the country in the wake of the crackdown launched by the CM Amarinder Singh government against gangsters. Punjab Police had narrowly missed while trying to nab him in the UAE. Eventually, he was traced in Armenia, following which Punjab Police got a look out circular (LOC) and red corner notice (RCN) issued from Interpol, Gupta said. Armenian police had arrested Budda on August 8, following which a few pro-Khalistan activists in Europe had posted an update on Facebook about Budda's arrest, calling him a strong voice for Khalistan in Punjab. Subsequently, a special Punjab Police team under Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh, AIG Counter Intelligence, Jalandhar, and DSP Bikram Brar was deputed to coordinate with Armenia regarding the deportation of the fugitive criminal.

Punjab: Dera Baba Nanak set to get passport service centre | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"AMRITSAR: To cater to devotees wanting to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, especially on the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, the government is all set to open a Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK) at Dera Baba Nanak. This will enable people living near the Kartarpur corridor to avail passport services at their doorstep. According to highly placed sources, the ministry of external affairs will launch the facility at Dera Baba Nanak in the near future in view of the problems faced by pilgrims in obtaining passports. Punjab already has three passport offices, five Passport Seva Kendras and six POPSKs. Six passport camps had been organised in Punjab in the recent past for processing applications of passport-seekers. Passport officer, Amritsar, Munish Kapoor said that POPSKs are set up in the post office buildings where postal staff render passport delivery services, including issuances of token, biometrics and document scans. The POPSKs help in wider coverage of passport services. He said the Regional Passport Office would also hold more camps if the need arises. The demand for passports has risen in the state following the opening of Kartarpur corridor on November 9 as many people want to visit the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara. Lack of passport is an impediment for many as it is a mandatory identification document as per the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor Agreement signed by India and Pakistan on October 24. Meanwhile, sources said that the government would again take up the issue of waiver of USD 20 service fee levied by Pakistan on pilgrims using the corridor. India had time and again asked Pakistan to do away with the service fee but Pakistan didn’t agree to it . Sources informed that by doing away with the USD 20 the number of pilgrims using corridor would shoot up. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra elections: Two more independent MLAs extend support to BJP | Pune News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Even as the BJP and its ally Shiv Sena try to resolve issues linked to government formation in Maharashtra after the recently concluded assembly elections, two independent MLAs have extended their support to Devendra Fadnavis and his party. Mahesh Baldi, MLA from Uran constituency and Gondia MLA Vinod Agrawal declared their support to the BJP under the leadership of Fadnavis. Earlier, rebel BJP MLA Geeta Jain had also extended support for him. At least five independent MLAs including Prahar Janshakti Party chief Bacchu Kadu, his party MLA Rajkumar Patel, Ashish Jaiswal, Narendra Bhondekar and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-backed independent MLA Shankarrao Gadakh have extended their support to Shiv Sena. The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance won an absolute majority in the Maharashtra assembly polls with the former emerging as the single-largest party with 105 seats. Shiv Sena bagged 56 seats in the elections. After the polls, Shiv Sena is adamant about the implementation of the 50:50 formula proposed by BJP during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The formula is a rotational arrangement in which a Chief Minister from each party will split the five-year term equally. ""The important question is who will be the chief minister? When the Lok Sabha elections were held we had decided on the 50-50 formula in the state,"" said Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra elections: Shiv Sena leader praises Sharad Pawar for stopping BJP in its stride | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Saamna is back to its old ways. Even as power-sharing talks for government formation are on, Sanjay Raut, Sena leader and executive editor of Saamna, in his weekly column 'Rokhthok' published on Sunday came down heavily on the BJP. He also praised NCP chief Sharad Pawar for single-handedly helping Congress and NCP to get 100 seats between them and 'stopping the BJP from forming the government on its own"". In his column, Raut stated that ""the remote control"" of the government will remain with Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. He added that BJP's strategy to contest on 164 seats in the state with an intention to get a clear majority to form the government was rejected by voters, as it won only 105 seats. Sena contested on 124 seats in the assembly polls and won 56 on its own. Raut, in his column, stated that though the party won less number of seats compared to the 2014 assembly polls (63), Thackeray will have the 'remote control' of power. ""The BJP's strategy of contesting 164 seats to ensure victory on at least 144 of them was rejected by voters. The election result is the defeat of unethical methods used by the BJP to increase the number of seats by poaching key Congress-NCP leaders by luring them or threatening them to join BJP,"" the column stated. According to political experts, Raut's column is expected to build pressure on its alliance partner, as BJP national president and Union home minister is likely to come to Mumbai by month-end to meet Thackeray to discuss the power-sharing formula. Sena is insisting on a 50-50% share of power, including the chief minister's post for 2.5 years. It claims this agreement had been reached before the Lok Sabha polls held in Maharashtra in April. Raut pointed out that the assembly results show that no one should be take Maharashtra voters 'for granted'. ""Even after winning 105 seats in the state, CM Devendra Fadnavis is in tension. The defeat of Udayanraje Bhosale, who switched form NCP to BJP, in the Satara bypoll was a message to those who were assuming they could do whatever wanted and win the polls,"" he said. Bhosale, who won the 2019 Lok Sabha poll from Satara, had resigned from the post within five months to join the BJP and contested the bypoll on a BJP ticket. Raut also praised Pawar in the column. ""People from 100 constituencies gave an answer to those who raised the question 'What Sharad Pawar did for Maharashtra?'. In 2014, the Sena stopped BJP's plan of forming the government on its own and now Pawar did the same in 2019. Congress and NCP were able to get about 100 seats in the state and the credit goes only to Pawar,"" said Raut. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra election: Fear of low turnout, nearly 40 BJP &amp; Sena rebels in the fray | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The ruling BJP-Shiv Sena appears to have an edge over a badly mauled opposition, but rebellion could affect the saffron alliance’s chances in nearly 40 constituencies in the state assembly elections, said political analysts. In all, 8.97 crore voters will choose from 3,237 candidates in 288 constituencies across the state on Monday. “While BJP has humbled the Congress-NCP by encouraging large-scale defections, it faces stiff opposition from the Sena, and the Sena from BJP rebels in many constituencies. This is a strange situation. Nature doesn’t like a vacuum, even in politics,” said a former bureaucrat. Assembly polls live: Voting under way in Maharashtra, HaryanaThe ruling alliance will be worried about whether agrarian distress, the state administration’s handling of the recent floods in parts of the state or the fallout of the PMC Bank scam and the overall economic slowdown may bring down its numbers. Its other worry is a low turnout—due to voter fatigue following the April-May Lok Sabha polls and the apparent lack of a serious contest in the assembly poll—in Mumbai, Pune and other cities, which it is confident of sweeping and where its talk on revoking Article 370 is intended to have maximum effect. The Congress-NCP too would be dreading depleted voting numbers: In parts of western Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha, where it is anxious to make a comeback, fewer voters coming out may mean ‘Advantage Incumbent’. PM Modi brought up the point at his rally at BKC when he said, “Don’t go to Gujarat, Goa or don’t think of going to Pune to meet your relatives. On Monday, queue up before the nearest polling booth and cast your vote.” Shorn of poll rhetoric, this campaign was chiefly centred around CM Devendra Fadnavis and Sharad Pawar. This reflects the big changes in state politics, said a chronicler. “While Fadnavis offers to voters a heady brew of technology and patriotism, Pawar represents the Nehruvian era steeped in consensual politics and collective leadership.” Congress-NCP banks on co-op sector networkFadnavis and Pawar campaigned vigorously across the state, in contrast with the Congress’s lacklustre campaign, which the NCP fears may hurt the opposition combine’s attempts to fight back. Intra-party revolt has come as a jolt to all parties, especially the BJP-Sena alliance because it is in power. The BJP in Mumbai denied nomination to three seniors: ministers Vinod Tawde and Prakash Mehta and former minister Raj Purohit. Mehta’s supporters went on a rampage in Ghatkopar, demanding ticket to their leader. Two days later, Mehta fell in line. However, despite attempts by Matoshree, Rajul Patel, the Sena rebel, continues to lock horns with Bharati Lavekar, the official ‘yuti’ candidate in Versova. Similarly, Trupti Sawant, Sena’s sitting MLA, is contesting against Mumbai Vishwanath Mahadeshwar, Sena’s official nominee in Bandra (East). In all, rebels from the saffron camp are taking on the alliance’s official candidates in 37 constituencies across the state. This may raise opposition hopes or even result in more Independents getting elected, said analysts. In Pune, a Sena rebel is crossing swords with Mukta Tilak, Pune mayor and BJP candidate in Kasba, a BJP bastion. In the Kothrud pocketborough of Pune, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil faces rough weather because of internecine squabbling and because Congress-NCP and other opposition parties have backed Kishore Shinde, the MNS candidate. The Congress-NCP combine is, in western Maharashtra, hoping to profit from its yet robust networking in the cooperative sector. Having bagged 44 of 62 seats in Vidarbha in the 2014 assembly polls, the BJP, this time around, faces a challenge from rebels here. Also, the Sena, which was keen on deepening its roots in the region, is not happy with its measly share of 12 seats. In Ramtek, Yeotmal, Umarkhed, Hinganghat, Bhandara and Washim constituencies, BJP candidates are being opposed by Sena rebels, while in Gondia, Buldhana, Daryapur, Arni and Tumsur, BJP faces intra-party revolt. The BJP-Sena are working at odds in nine of the 35 constituencies in northern Maharashtra, it is learned, while in 2 (Sakri and Shirpur), BJP is wracked by internal dissension. In Yeola in Nashik, former deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal is locked in a fierce poll combat with Sena’s Sambhaji Pawar. The BJP projected Fadnavis as its poster boy praised by both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. Both said Fadnavis was set to get a second term as CM. The election will determine the political future of bigwigs, including Fadnavis, ex-CMs Prithviraj Chavan and Ashok Chavan (both Congress), state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, NCP heavyweights Chhagan Bhujbal, Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse-Patil, and senior ministers, including Pankaja Munde, Girish Mahajan, Ashish Shelar (all BJP), Eknath Shinde (Sena) and Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, the former state Congress president who migrated to BJP and won a ministership in the Fadnavis regime, triggering more defections from Congress to BJP. Marathwada may go the BJP-Sena way as Congress-NCP failed to take on the ruling alliance on issues such as drought and water scarcity, it is said. Former Congress CM Ashok Chavan is said to be in a strong position in Nanded, while Amit Deshmukh and his brother Dhiraj of Congress seem set to retain Latur, the family bastion nurtured by their father, the late Vilasrao Deshmukh. In Beed, it’s a Munde-versus-Munde fight with BJP minister Pankaja Munde contesting against cousin, Dhananjay, an NCP leader. In coastal Konkan, the big fight is between Nitesh Rane (BJP) and Sena’s Satish Sawant in Kankavli. The Sena is miffed with Fadnavis for opening BJP’s doors for ex-CM Narayan Rane, Nitesh’s father. The Sena considers the Ranes its principal political rivals in Konkan. In Raigad district, a BJP rebel has filed nomination papers against Manohar Bhoir, the Sena nominee. The BJP is contesting 164 of the total 288 seats, while the Sena's tally is 124, the party's lowest in the saffron alliance’s 25 years of poll partnership, a clear indication that Sena has been reduced to a junior partner in the ‘yuti’ and that Matoshree’s plan to form a government on its own remains a distant dream. The BJP seems inching closer to the late Pramod Mahajan's gameplan of ‘shat pratishat BJP’, 100% growth of the party in Maharashtra. Uddhav Thackeray agreed to play second fiddle to BJP in order to retain Sena’s share in power in absence of which he fears a split in the party. At the Dussehra conclave in Mumbai this month, he made it clear to his followers he preferred power to rough and ready politics of the past.

"Mumbai election results: BJP bags 16, Shiv Sena 14 of Mumbai’s 36 seats, may impact civic polls | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The BJP won 16 of the total 36 assembly seats in Mumbai while the Sena annexed 14. The Congress won 4 and NCP and SP one each. The BJP also bagged 12 of the 24 assembly seats in the Mumbai region (MMR) against the Sena’s five. The city results could impact the 2022 BMC elections, said political observers. Aditya Thackeray’s thumping win in Worli cheered Sena’s shakhas, but mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar’s defeat in Bandra (East) was a jolt. Among the BJP winners across the city were education minister Ashish Shelar (Bandra West), junior minister Yogesh Sagar (Charkop), Atul Bhatkhalkar (Kandivli East), Vidya Thakur (Goregaon), city BJP chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha (Malabar Hill), Parag Alavani (Vile Parle), Amit Satam (Andheri West) and Manisha Chaudhary (Dahisar). Among BJP’s first-time MLAs are Parag Shah (Ghatkopar West), Mihir Kotecha (Mulund), Sunil Rane (Borivli) and Rahul Narwekar (Colaba). Serial party-hopper Kalidas Kolambkar won from Wadala-—his eighth consecutive term. Sena stalwarts, including minister Ravindra Waikar, Sunil Prabhu, Sada Sarvankar, Sanjay Potnis, Sunil Raut and Prakash Surve are back in the assembly. As are Mumbai Congress leaders Amin Patel and Warsha Gayakwad—from Mumbadevi and Dharavi. Nawab Malik of NCP won the Anushakti Nagar seat while SP’s Abu Azmi won from Mankhurd-Shivaji Nagar. BJP gallops to bigger win than Sena in cityThe BJP has stolen a march over the Shiv Sena by winning 16 of the total 36 state assembly seats in Mumbai while the latter annexed 14. The assembly poll results were announced on Thursday. The state assembly elections will have far-reaching consequences for the 2022 BMC elections, said political observers. The BJP lagged behind the Sena tally of 84 only by two in the 2017 Mumbai civic elections. While the BJP may have suffered a dent in other parts of the state, it retained its electoral clout in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, bagging 12 assembly seats in Thane and Raigad districts. The Sena tally is five. Aditya Thackeray’s handsome victory in the Worli constituency brought cheer across Sena’s shakhas. On the other hand, Mumbai mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar’s defeat in Bandra (East), just a stone’s throw from Matoshree, came as a jolt. BJP winners are fairly sprinkled across the city: Education minister Ashish Shelar (Bandra West), junior minister Yogesh Sagar (Charkop), Atul Bhatkhalkar (Kandivli East), Vidya Thakur (Goregaon), city BJP chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha (Malabar Hill), Parag Alavani (Vile Parle), Amit Satam (Andheri West) and Manisha Chaudhary (Dahisar), to name a few. Ramesh Singh Thakur, BJP candidate from Malad (West), popular as Malvani, lost to Aslam Shaikh, the Congressman who is set to begin his third term as MLA. “Shaikh was leading in the first two rounds followed by a setback till the 13th round. Thereafter, he regained his lead till the last,” said poll manager Ameya Bhosale. “Mumbaikars took cognizance of the infrastructure projects being implemented by the Fadnavis government in Mumbai and voted generously for the BJP,” said Satam, who had a surprise guest—Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s brother Pankaj Modi —as his VIP campaigner during the last phase of electioneering. “Pankajbhai is a dear friend. I have known him for many years,” said Satam. Among BJP’s first-timers in the lotus-shaped Vidhan Bhavan are Parag Shah (Ghatkopar West), Mihir Kotecha (Mulund), Sunil Rane (Borivli) and Rahul Narwekar (Colaba). Narwekar joined the BJP as poll drums began to beat last month. A senior BJP functionary from Worli, Rane was sent off to Borivli after the party denied nomination to minister for cultural affairs Vinod Tawde. Kalidas Kolambkar, who defected from the Sena to the Congress in 2006 and joined the BJP in the run-up to the state assembly election, will be the senior-most member of the house— his eighth consecutive term. Kolambkar won from Wadala. Sena stalwarts, including minister Ravindra Waikar, Sunil Prabhu, Sada Sarvankar, Sanjay Potnis, Sunil Raut and Prakash Surve are back in the assembly, indicating the Sena has retained its hold over its bastions. Mumbai Congress leaders Amin Patel and Warsha Gayakwad won from their strongholds—Mumbadevi and Dharavi, respectively. Nawab Malik, the lone NCP candidate, won the Anushakti Nagar seat, trouncing Sena’s Tukaram Kate, while Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi won from Mankhurd-Shivaji Nagar constituency.

Elections in Maharashtra: Six issues that may shape the vote in this Maharashtra election | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Voting is under way in all 288 assembly constituencies of Maharashtra where 3,237 candidates, including 235 women, are in the fray. The BJP, under CM Devendra Fadnavis's leadership, is seeking a second straight term in the state. The BJP has fielded its nominees in 164 assembly seats, including candidates of smaller allies contesting on its lotus symbol, while Shiv Sena is contesting 124 seats. On the other hand, the opposition Congress has fielded 147 candidates and its ally NCP 121. Here are six factors that may determine the outcome in these elections: Assembly polls live: Voting under way in Maharashtra, Haryana1. Maratha reservationThe BJP-Sena regime’s decision to appease Maharashtra’s most dominant community with a 12% quota in educational institutions and government jobs is expected to have an impact on the outcome of the polls. The reservation, which is in addition to the newly introduced one for the economically weaker section (EWS), enabled BJP to make inroads beyond OBC and Brahmin constituencies into Maratha country. By plugging for it, Devendra Fadnavis—only the second Brahmin CM ever in the state— managed to earn the street cred he needed to come across as a mass leader. 2. Article 370The BJP has trumpeted its decision to nullify the special status enjoyed by Jammu and Kashmir at every poll rally. But the Opposition has called the display of nationalism in a state poll a diversion. In any case, local issues such as drought relief or job loss have received less air time than government’s “brave” decision to bring J&K closer to the union. But will burnishing nationalist credentials strengthen the prospects of BJP’s state unit? The verdict is still out. 3. CorruptionThe issue has a resonance that cuts across class and social divides. By projecting a tough-on-corruption stand, BJP has gained an upper hand. With a narrative focused on the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank scam and irrigation contracts of the past, NCP leaders have been pushed to explain their role in previous regimes. However, the probe has barely progressed despite prodding by courts. But the cases make headlines and opposition leaders have no recourse, except to paint themselves as victims of a vindictive establishment. 4. Agrarian distressMaharashtra still records the most farmer suicides, more than 12,000 in the four years from 2015-1019. Drought and floods have left agriculturists in Vidarbha, Marathwada and western Maharashtra wringing their hands. Fadnavis regime’s loan waiver benefited roughly 44 lakh of the 89 lakh farmers eligible. Rest are chafing at the delay in writing off their debts, which prevents them from raising fresh bank funds. While the state government claims agriculture output in 2018-19 has been better than in most drought years, production has fallen. Unable to realise better remuneration and dependent on support pricing, rural sector still awaits reforms that are needed to make farming profitable. But will this impact on the election? That’s a tough ask, given that many of the problems are legacy issues. 5. Central & state schemesFrom the Prime Minister Samman Nidhi pension of Rs 6,000/year to insurance payouts for crop failure, from rural housing grants to toilets and farm ponds, each of these welfare schemes has high penetration and are expected to cushion the impact of anti-incumbency. Cumulatively, they are seen as signs of a government that works, even if it falls short of expectations. 6. The Fadnavis factorThe CM managed to steer a stable though sporadically unruly coalition through his term, providing continuity in decision-making and keeping broad parameters under control. His main focus was infrastructure development, which paved the way for big-ticket projects like Mumbai-Nagpur superhighway and Metro rail expansion in urban centres. With deadlines and targets, he kept the bureaucracy on its toes. Critics have, however, slammed his handling of the agriculture sector, questioned the poor outcomes in education, and pointed to government’s inability to generate jobs despite a large industrial base.

Zilla parishad election results Maharashtra: Maha Vikas Aghadi wrests Beed from BJP | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: Pankaja Munde, the beleaguered former rural development minister who had lost her Parli seat in the 2019 polls, received another setback on Saturday as she lost both the zilla parishad president and vice president’s post to the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which was led by her estranged cousin and Cabinet minister Dhanajay Munde. The MVA had fielded NCP’s Shivkanya Shirsath for the president’s post while Bajrang Sonwane was its vice-president nominee. The BJP fielded Yogini Thorat and Bharat Kale respectively for the president and vice-president’s posts respectively. Sources in the NCP said that the MVA nominees received 32 votes each while the BJP candidates got 21 each. “The results might be declared on January 13, subject to the outcome of high court verdict in case of five ZP members.” Pankaja’s younger sister and Beed MP Preetam Munde, told reporters that the BJP already had 19 members and an independent and got its president and vice-president elected earlier with the help other members, so it can’t be said that the BJP lost the numbers. She as well as BJP MLC Suresh Dhas asserted that Shiv Sena members, who earlier supported the BJP to win the ZP, couldn’t do so due to the changed in the political equation at the state-level and had to toe the MVA line. Meanwhile, Pankaja tweeted: “It’s an impact of Aghadi in the state. Last night, the Sena has expressed its inability to come along despite their wishes. Participating in the election as a part of democratic process. Otherwise, the outcome is clear.” Sources in the administration who conducted the poll process said that as per the high court direction, they conducted the election and would submit the outcome before the HC on January 13 in a sealed envelope. “The petition by five disqualified ZP members is pending in the high court, which would come up for hearing on January 13,” an official said on condition of anonymity.

"NOTA will catch on, says ex-Maharashtra poll chief | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: There is a call for boycott of elections by depositors of PMC Bank, but no major call for opting for 'None of the Above' or NOTA. A few housing societies in Navi Mumbai, the federation Agris and Kolis in Navi Mumbai and those opposed to reservation for Marathas have asked for NOTA.

Maharashtra: MVA fields joint nominees for 2 legislative council seats | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Nominations for the by-polls to two seats of the state legislative council were filed on Tuesday. The two seats, one of which was occupied by NCP’s Dhananjay Munde and the other by the Shiv Sena’s Tanaji Sawant, fell vacant after both won last October’s assembly elections. For Munde’s seat, the Maha Vikas Aghadi has nominated a joint candidate, Sanjay Daund, who is an NCP leader. Daund, a member of the Beed zilla parishad, was accompanied by Maharashtra minister and NCP state unit chief Jayant Patil and another party minister Dhananjay Munde as he submitted his papers. The elections are due on January 24 for this seat, which will be voted for by members of the assembly. BJP has nominated Rajan Teli for the by-poll against Daund. Considering that MVA has 170 members out of 288 in the assembly, it is likely Daund would win. For the Yavatmal seat left vacant after Sawant won the assembly poll, Sena, again as part of the MVA coalition, has nominated Dushyant Chaturvedi, son of former minister Satish Chaturvedi, while BJP has nominated Sumit Bajoria, brother of NCP’s former MLC Sandeep Bajoria.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Independents, smaller parties make up bloc of 29 | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Independents and smaller parties have gained at the cost of bigger parties in Maharashtra, making them crucial to the formation of the next government. In 2014, there were 13 MLAs who won on tickets from smaller parties and seven who were independents. This time, there are 29 such winners, including 13 independents, some of whom are BJP and Shiv Sena rebels who contested on their own on being denied tickets. A senior BJP leader said, ""Independents are most likely to extend support to us as they cannot risk their future if there is instability and mid-term polls are called for. Thus, it is in their interest as well as ours to work together.""  Last time, the 13 MLAs from smaller parties were from CPM (1), All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (2), SP (1), Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (3) of Hitendra Thakur, MNS (1), PWP (3), Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (1) and Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh (1) of Prakash Ambedkar. This time, there are 16 from smaller parties - BVA (3), MNS (1), AIMIM (2), SP (2), PWP (1), CPM (1), Jan Surajya Paksha (1), Krantikari Shetkari Paksha (1), Prahar Janashakti Paksha (2), Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (1) and Swabhimani Paksha (1). However, support of MNS, Swabhimani Paksha, AIMIM, SP and CPM to the BJP-led government is ruled out. The others - Jan Surajya Paksha, Krantikari Shetkari and Prahar Janshakti - may be willing to play ball.  A BJP leader said, ""The support of these smaller parties and independents will dent the bargaining power of the Shiv Sena, which has again begun to show its unpredictable nature by demanding a 50:50 power sharing agreement."" The accommodation of these small parties or independents in the government will mean that the BJP will have to drop some of its own favourites to accommodate them, besides allotting chairmanships of government-run bodies and corporations.

"Regain Dalit support, work hard for zilla parishad polls: Sharad Pawar to cadre | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Reacting to the erosion of its vote base in the 2019 Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, NCP president Sharad Pawar on Sunday asked his party workers to draft an action plan to win over Dalits and neo-Buddhists. ""Traditionally, Dalits and neo-buddhists have been with the NCP. However in the recent past, they have joined the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA). We will have to redraft our strategy to bring back these people into the NCP fold,"" he said. At a meeting attended by former deputy chief ministers Ajit Pawar and Chhagan Bhujbal and state NCP president Jayant Patil, Pawar interacted with party candidates, who were defeated in the assembly elections. Most of them said they had lost owing to the presence of VBA nominees in the fray. NCP won 54 seats in the assembly polls, but its overall vote share slipped to 16.7% from 17.2% in the 2014 state polls. The VBA and other secular parties are believed to have split the minority and SC/ST votes in around 35 constituencies to the detriment of both NCP and Congress. ""Assembly elections are over; we received a mixed response. In the days to come, particularly for the zilla parishad elections, all of us will have to work hard. One of the reasons for the defeat of NCP nominees was massive abuse of power by the BJP, which is ruling in Maharashtra as well as at the Centre. It was also found that some of our own workers did not work for the NCP nominees. I will personally look into all the issues raised by the defeated candidates,"" the NCP chief said. Pawar said that he found that the younger generation was with the NCP, particularly members of the minority community, as they were determined to ensure that the BJP is kept out of power. In addition, owing to the failure of the government in tackling the agrarian crisis, the party had the backing of the farming community. ""We need self-introspection. Where we failed, we need to change our strategy. I feel that in several districts, we will have to bring in a younger leadership and give opportunities to the younger generation for revival of the organization at all levels."" Pawar also felt there was urgent need to concentrate on Mumbai and Thane. ""Long back people of Mumbai and Thane were with us. In the state polls, we won just one seat. All of us will have to work hard and win over the confidence of the people."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra assembly elections: Poll trends likely by 1pm, first result from Chiplun by noon | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Trends for the assembly elections are likely to be known by 1pm and the first result is expected from Chiplun around noon on Thursday. “Since there are only three candidates in the fray for Chiplun, we expect the entire counting exercise to be complete by noon,” a senior bureaucrat told TOI on Wednesday. All results are likely to be declared by 7pm.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Eight ministers find the going tough, lose elections | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: In a major loss of face to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, eight of his ministers were defeated in the polls. While it was expected that some would lose, the defeat of agriculture minister Anil Bonde was a big surprise as was that of high-profile rural development minister Pankaja Munde. Daughter of veteran BJP leader, the late Gopinath Munde, she lost to her cousin and arch political rival Dhananjay Munde by a large margin of 31,000 votes. Ever since Pankaja was inducted into the state cabinet five years ago she was at loggerheads with Dhananjay, the leader of opposition in the council, who had levelled charges of corruption against her. Another notable to bite the dust was Parinay Fuke, the minister of state for forest, and a trusted aide to the xchief minister. He lost to Congress candidate Nana Patole from Sakola district by a margin of 15,000 votes. Employment guarantee minister Jaidutta Kshirsagar, who joined the Shiv Sena on the eve of the assembly elections, was defeated by his nephew Sandeep Kshirsagar from Beed. There was bad blood between the two for a long time. In fact, Sandeep had publicly abused Jaidutta at a public function in Beed district. Senior Shiv Sena leader and minister of state for textiles, Arjun Khotkar, was defeated from Jalna city by Congress' Kailash Gorantiyal. According to reports, Khotkar's defeat owed much to the local BJP leaders, who were unhappy that he had taken on the party's leadership. Minister for marketing Ram Shinde was defeated by Rohit Pawar, grand-nephew of Sharad Pawar, from Karjat Jamkhed constituency in Ahmednagar district. Though Shinde was confident of victory, Rohit was able to defeat him, as he had established a connect with his constituents in the last three years. Shinde had banked on Rohit losing due to his outsider status. More shocking was the defeat of agriculture minister Anil Bonde by Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Devendra Bhuyar from Morshi in Amravati district. Bhuyar polled 96,152 votes while Bonde secured 86,361 votes.

Maharashtra elections: Challenger to Devendra Fadnavis’ seat calls chief minister an absentee MLA - Times of India,"NAGPUR: The biggest poll battle in the state elections on October 21 will be witnessed in Nagpur South-West that has earned the tag of chief minister’s constituency. CM Devendra Fadnavis (49) is seeking fifth consecutive term as legislator from the city and a hat-trick from South-West seat. So confident he and his party are of the victory here that Fadnavis has left it to party men to manage his campaign. He has barely attended two public meetings here since he is busy touring across the state. Pitted against Fadnavis is a youthful Congress leader Ashish Deshmukh (45) who till two years ago was with the ruling BJP. It’s virtually a straight fight between Fadnavis and Deshmukh as candidates of smaller parties like BSP, and an independent Prashant Pawar, are too insignificant and likely to fall by the wayside. Fadnavis won last time by a margin of 59,000 votes defeating a more rooted Congress candidate Praful Gudadhe-Patil. This time no one from the Congress was willing to contest against Fadnavis knowing well what the outcome would be. Deshmukh, desperate to make a comeback in the Congress after re-joining it in 2017, was at the last moment offered the tough task and he boldly accepted the challenge. Fadnavis has never lost any election till date, right from the civic body (NMC) of which he got to be one of the youngest mayors. He entered the assembly by winning from Nagpur West in 1999 and again won the seat in 2009. He also from the newly created South-West constituency in 2009 and 2014. His image as a clean, sincere politician keen on grasping any situation with intellect has enabled him to rise so fast in public life. Fadnavis has already created a record becoming the second Maharashtra chief minister to complete a full-term. His term saw a big push being given to development projects not only in the city but in entire Vidarbha that was neglected for decades during the Congress rule. Since Fadnavis is campaigning for party candidates across the state, his campaign here is being handled by Sandip Joshi, ruling party leader in the NMC. Party MLC Anil Sole, mayor Nanda Jichkar and the whole party is engaged in the campaign. “We have set a target of victory margin of 1 lakh votes for Fadnavis. There is tremendous enthusiasm among voters who are proud that their vote would go on to make Fadnavis chief minister for the second term,” said Joshi. Asked if Fadnavis’ not getting time to canvass for himself was a setback, Joshi and Jichkar point out the tremendous response to the “I am Devendra too” theme of the campaign. “It will be vote for development that the city witnessed in last five years by way of road works and Metro project. Mihan has taken off only in the last five years creating 17,000 jobs. Before that it was languishing for a decade,” Joshi said. Deshmukh said he is in the ring to create history. “I will surprise all with a giant-killer win. Fadnavis will be defeated as voters do not like their representative staying so far away from them. He has locked up his house here and stays in Mumbai where he is inaccessible to common man. Every section of society is angry with BJP. Traders, businessmen reeling under slowdown, students supporting ‘Save Merit Save Nation’ agitation, residents tired of unending road and Metro work, the unemployed waiting for opportunities are all going to vote against the BJP,” he said. His campaign paints Fadnavis as failure on all fronts mainly providing employment to youths. They have to look for jobs in Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru leaving old, ailing parents behind. “Mihan has failed to provide promised jobs,” said Deshmukh. Deshmukh claims to have a better and more studied vision of development and if elected would concentrate on improving ease of living for people. “Education and health are two issues that BJP government has not bothered to address. I will work to improve government schools and introduce mohalla clinics like in Delhi. I will create situation that would bring prosperity to every household,” he said.

No airspace for star campaigners: NCP | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The NCP has written to the Election Commission (EC) claiming helicopters of two of its star campaigners were denied permission to fly in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Maharashtra on October 17. The letter, dated October 18, asked the EC to take strict action against officials who ""deliberately"" cancelled tours of its campaigners. The NCP said helicopters carrying MP Amol Kolhe and another leader Amol Mitkari were denied flying permission on October 17 in view of the PM's movement. Due to this, Kolhe could not hold public meetings in Pune, while Mitkari's helicopter was grounded at Sindkheda constituency in Dhule, the party said. ""We are not aware if the ruling party and the PM country have a different set of rules for air operations... During his tour, our star campaigners were denied airspace on two occasions,"" the NCP said in its letter to the EC secretary. Not allowing NCP leaders to campaign indicated ""bias"", and cancellation of rallies also resulted in ""huge losses"" to the party in terms of ""time, money and resources"", it said. The letter said EC should furnish the law under which NCP leaders were denied flying permission due to the PM's movement.

His campaign paints Fadnavis as failure on all fronts mainly providing employment to youths. They have to look for jobs in Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru leaving old, ailing parents behind. “Mihan has failed to provide promised jobs,” said Deshmukh. Deshmukh claims to have a better and more studied vision of development and if elected would concentrate on improving ease of living for people. “Education and health are two issues that BJP government has not bothered to address. I will work to improve government schools and introduce mohalla clinics like in Delhi. I will create situation that would bring prosperity to every household,” he said.

"Maharashtra govt formation: ‘Meet with NCP, Congress soon’ as Shiv Sena races to get the numbers | India News - Times of India","The Shiv Sena will be racing against time if it wants to realise its long-held ambitions of leading a government. Sources said Sena MP Sanjay Raut is likely to meet NCP chief Sharad Pawar and visit Delhi to seek an appointment with Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the next 24 hours. The Sena may also approach the governor to seek more time to prove it has the numbers. All the party’s 56 party MLAs will meet at the Madh island resort at 9.30am today. Political analysts said with the governor calling the Sena, the party was faced with tough options: sever ties with BJP and forge a viable working relationship with Congress and NCP, or retrace steps and seek a compromise with its pre-poll partner. Despite major differences with BJP, the Sena has stopped short of calling off the alliance. The Sena has one Union minister, Arvind Sawant, at the Centre. “We cannot continue to sit on the fence now. We wanted the BJP to show their inability to form the government…now that too has happened, ’’ said a Sena leader. At least 33 newly elected Congress legislators from Maharashtra, currently camping at a resort in Jaipur, have already indicated that they are keen to back a non-BJP government. Senior Congress leaders Ahmed Patel and Madhusudan Mistry were expected to reach Mumbai on Sunday night to initiate negotiations. As for NCP, its spokesperson Nawab Malik said since Fadnavis has declined to stake claim and the governor has invited Sena’s legislative party leader Eknath Shinde, the latter must make a bid to form the government. For support from NCP, he said, Sena must “terminate its alliance with BJP and its minister in the Union Cabinet must forthwith quit’’.

Maharashtra assembly elections: Rebel 'Draupadi' trounces BJP in Mira-Bhayandar's Mahabharat | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Former Mira-Bhayandar mayor Geeta Jain's victory over sitting BJP MLA Narendra Mehta in the twin city's assembly constituency has become one of the most talked-about wins of a saffron camp rebel in the just-concluded assembly polls. Marked by drama in the election run-up, the contest's colours refuse to fade even at its conclusion. ""The people have reposed faith in me. Not only was I Draupadi in this battle, all of Mira-Bhayandar was treated badly by the rulers. My supporters became Krishna and rescued me,"" a jubilant Jain (55), who contested as an independent, said on Friday after becoming the twin city's first woman MLA. For good reason. A local favourite for quite some time, as opposed to Mehta, who got embroiled in a couple of controversies in recent months, traditional saffron voters wanted her to get the BJP's ticket. ""That didn't occur. Mehta, considered here to be the chief minister's blue-eyed boy, got nominated,"" said one of Jain's supporters. A post-result analysis showed that a large chunk of Mehta's traditional Gujarati-Marwari-North Indian voter base ditched him. Differences cropped up between Mehta and Jain two years ago when the former ensured that Jain, who was Mira-Bhayandar's mayor between 2015-17, was replaced in the post by his sister-in-law Dimple Mehta. The move only increased Jain's popularity locally, as a perception took root that she was a 'woman wronged'. Adding to the groundswell of support for her was disenchantment within a section of local Shiv Sena corporators and workers with Mehta over a memorial for Bal Thackeray. The Sainiks, feeling slighted, started rooting for Jain. On Friday, a day after she defeated Mehta by over 15,500 votes, Jain's WhatsApp status message read: 'Let the agenda be the development of Mira-Bhayander'. Despite her victory, and though she quit the BJP before filing her nomination papers, she insists that she continues to be a diehard follower of the party. In fact, the BJP's lotus flag was ubiquitous in her victory procession. ""I am not against the lotus,"" said Jain, who was on a padyatra throughout Friday morning thanking voters. ""I just want to clean the muck below it."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra assembly elections: Smaller parties and independents polled 23%, almost as high as BJP | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Smaller parties and independents polled 23% of the votes in the state assembly election, almost as high as the vote share of BJP, the single largest party, which secured 25.7% of votes. This is a steep jump from 2014 when smaller parties and independents secured 14% of votes, according to the Election Commission data. The data on smaller parties does not include Raj Thackeray’s MNS. A major reason for the surge is the rise in the number of independents, on account of the rebels entering the fray against the saffron combine. The BJP’s strategy of inducting defectors from the Congress-NCP in the run-up to the elections had triggered rebellions from ticket-seekers within the saffron combine. Over 50 rebels had entered the electoral battle against the saffron parties, cutting into their vote. In 2014, seven independents won the polls. This election, the figure almost doubled to 13. Of these, five were rebel candidates. The search for alternatives also seems to have drawn voters to smaller parties, says political analyst Abhay Deshpande. “The rise in the vote share of others is a clear sign that people are looking for alternatives beyond the four major parties. A vote for a rebel is also a vote against the established parties,” he said. In the 2014 polls, the four national parties contested separately, allowing voters greater choices. This election, the voter may have felt she had fewer choices and opted for smaller parties and independents, Deshpande feels. The smaller parties in the state that won seats include Hitendra Thakur’s Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (3), the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen AIMIM (2), Peasants and Workers Party (1), Samajwadi Party (2), Vinay Kore’s Jan Surajya Paksha (1), Swabhimaani Paksha (1), Prahaar Janshakti Paksha (2), the CPI-M (1) and the Krantikari Shetkari Paksha (1). Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi may not have won any seats but it garnered vote share. It was placed second in as many as 10 seats, 9 of which were won by the BJP-Sena. It also spoilt the chances of the Congress-NCP candidates in several other seats, by significantly cutting into their vote. The Dhule City seat in North Maharashtra is an example of the voter preference for smaller parties, other than the main contenders. The top three candidates were all from smaller parties. The seat was won by Faruq Anwar Shah from AIMIM, an independent Rajubaba Kadambande was second and the third spot was taken by Anil Gote of the Lok Sangram Party. The Shiv Sena candidate was in fourth place. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra assembly elections: Riding on SC/ST votes, passive Congress surprises itself with its performance | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Not with standing its humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in May, when it won just one seat combined with the total lack of enthusiasm at all levels in the party during the campaign, Congress has managed to better its performance, securing 44 seats against 42 it had won in the 2014 edition. State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat won and so did former CMs,Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan. The Congress was able to improve its performance due to substantive support it got from the Dalits, Muslims and members of the scheduled caste (SC) and schedule tribe (ST) communities. The party was also able to neutralize the impact of Prakash Ambedkar led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections Congress and NCP together had lost at least nine seats owing to presence of VBA nominees. Compared to 2014, when Congress and NCP won 7 SC/ST seats each, they have managed to up their tally to 12 seats respectively, leading to a combined rise of 10 seats this election. During the same period BJP’s seat tally for this segment fell from 25 to 16 while that of Sena declined from 12 to 8, a total loss of 13 seats. “We were expecting more seats so that we could form government, but still we accept the verdict. In the days to come, we will work for the cause of the people. We feel that all sections of the society are with the Congress,’’ Thorat told TOI. However, a worrying factor is that the party’s vote share has dropped to 16% from 18% in the last elections. Ever since the Congress-NCP government was dislodged in October 2014 by the BJP, it appeared that the fight had gone out of the top Congress leaders. In the last five years, senior Congress leaders were unable to take on the BJP-led government on any issue. The then-leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil was hobnobbing with the chief minister and on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections, after his son was denied a Lok Sabha ticket, he joined the BJP. Patil was followed by many senior Congress leaders. A senior Congress leader admitted that at a juncture when it was thought that seniors would swing into action and galvanize the organization at all levels, nobody stepped forward to take the responsibility. Rahul Gandhi addressed just five meetings while his mother and sister sat out the campaign. “While Sharad Pawar took the entire state by storm, Congress leaders did not move out of their home turfs. We failed to activate our workers, as a result, we gave the state to the saffron combine on the platter,” he said. A Congress source added that there was such low expectation from this election that they started the Congress war room just a week before the date of polling.

On the other hand, the number of big wins in this election where the winning candidate had a lead of over 50,000 was considerably higher compared to 2014. As many as 45 contestants won with a margin of between 50,000 and 1 lakh. Four candidates managed a huge win, in the range of 1--2.5 lakh.  Among the 37 candidates who won with a margin of less than 5,000 votes, 19 are from the saffron alliance, while 14 belong to the United Progressive Alliance of the Congress-NCP. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis won the Nagpur south west seat with a margin of 49,344 votes, defeating Congress's Ashish Deshmukh. Dilip Lande of the Shiv Sena won with the narrowest margin of 409 votes against the old Congress warhorse Arif Naseem Khan from Chandivali.

"Shiv Sena-BJP stay strong in rest of Mumbai Metropolitan Region, PWP loses its seats in Pen, Alibaug | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance continued their dominance in the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, winning a combined 17 of 24 assembly seats across Palghar, Raigad, and Thane districts. With a slew of multi-crore infrastructure projects being planned in these areas—including a bullet train and new airport—these seats are increasingly important for political parties. In terms of vote share, both the Sena and BJP saw gains in the region. Sena share rose to 29% in 24 assembly seats in the three districts, up from 22% in 2014, while BJP’s vote share rose four points to 24%. “The surprise element is that the party has made inroads in Palghar too,” san analyst, referring to the party’s winning the Palghar assembly seat. The ruling BJP picked up one more seat this time—for a total of nine seats—retaining control of Navi Mumbai as well as Panvel, where it is led by former Congressman Prashant Thakur. Congress did not manage to win a single seat this time either, and its voting share slipped further from 11% in 2014 to 4% this year. Meanwhile the NCP lost two of its three seats, winning only in Mumbra-Kalwa. Smaller players like the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) and the Peasants and Workers Party (PWP) had a mixed performance. The BVA won three seats in Vasai-Virar. Observers attribute the win to the grass root connect that the Thakurs have with the people. But the PWP came a cropper, losing its two seats in Pen and Alibag. The party, once so strong in this region, will not have a single representative in the Legislative Assembly. Internal differences within the party and rivalry with the local Congress cadre is thought to have led to the electoral loss. However, nobody is willing to write off the PWP. “The PWP is quite resilient and has managed to weather similar storms in the past as its has a grassroot connect,” said a Congress member.

This motley crowd has won 29 assembly seats in all, which is more than 10% of the total strength of the House. There are 13 independents which include the victorious rebels. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis at the end of counting made it clear that he is reaching out to this section even though the alliance is in a majority and can form the government.

Maharashtra assembly elections: Bandra boy brings gloom to Sena in Matoshree's backyard | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Defeating sitting MLA Trupti Sawant and mayor and Shiv Sena candidate Vishwanath Mahadeshwar, Congress's Zeeshan Siddique (27) became one of the youngest to win the assembly elections from Bandra (E). The constituency was important for Sena as it houses Matoshree, the residence of Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. After Mahadeshwar's defeat, the area bore a glum look. Zeeshan, who won by over 5,000 votes, is the son of former three-term Bandra (W) MLA Baba Siddique. He polled 38,337 votes, while Mahadeshwar polled 32,547. Sawant, who contested as an Independent after being denied a ticket by Sena, polled 24,071 votes. Observers said Mahadeshwar and Sawant contesting separately cost the party the seat, which was with it since 2009. In 2004, Janardhan Chandorkar (Congress) held it. He had told TOI that he would win by over 5,000 votes when initial trends showed him in third position. Zeeshan said, ""I am a fighter, winning and losing are part of life. I humbly accept the people's mandate."" His father Baba, mother Shehzeen and sister Arshia went to the voting centre with former Bandra (W) MP Priya Dutt to congratulate him. Supporters lit crackers and shouted slogans in his support. ""I am happy I have got a large share of votes even from Sena strongholds. This shows people wanted a change, and as a young, progressive candidate, they have felt a connect with me,"" he said. On whether his lack of experience could be a hindrance, Dutt said, ""He has all of us (pointing towards Baba) as advisers. As old guards, we will always be there to guide him.""

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis exchange loaded signals | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday refused to be drawn into any speculation about government formation or power sharing arrangement with the Shiv Sena. Playing it cool, he remarked light-heartedly: “It’s been decided between us (Sena-BJP) and we will go ahead accordingly.” This was a signal to party chief Uddhav that the Sena would be suitably placated in a day or two before the BJP high command okays the list of Maharashtra’s ministers. Sources said Uddhav’s gameplan is to wrest more—and meatier—portfolios from the BJP when he will sit down with the CM for negotiations on formation of governmen Thackeray may also insist that Amit Shah participate in the talks, it is learnt. Shah, who had come down to Mumbai to meet Uddhav during the LS elections, had not visited Matoshree during the assembly poll campaign. Uddhav is said to be “too sensitive” to matters of protocol which were in vogue during the Balasaheb Thackeray era, when A B Vajpayee or L K Advani would call on Sena founder. Moreover, Uddhav may also insist that the government should accord priority to the Sena’s poll manifesto, which includes a general loan amnesty to farmers, a ‘thaali’ for Rs 10 and medical check-up for one rupee. This will aggravate the crisis in the saffron alliance as the BJP wouldn’t want to take up the Sena agenda for implementation, said party watchers. Both Uddhav and Fadnavis sent loaded signals to each other through their pressers. While Uddhav spoke of how the poll results were an “eye-opener” for the Sena-BJP and how the ruling alliance should be concentrating on the day-to-day problems of the people, a beaming Fadnavis refused to be drawn into any debate on thorny issues, including the poll defeat of seven saffron ministers. “It’s time for celebration. The poll results show the BJP’s strike rate has gone up. Deep contemplation on where we went wrong will take place tomorrow,” he said. Inquiries revealed the CM was keen on going ahead with the swearing-in ceremony of first batch of BJP-Sena ministers on Friday. Instructions were issued to general administration and the home department to this effect, it is reliably learnt. Fadnavis wants the BJPSena regime to be installed in office at the earliest in order to keep Sharad Pawar, a veteran strategist, at bay. “Pawar has scored a major win. He may try to work out new political equations with Sena at the centrestage,” said a BJP strategist. Speculation was rife on Thursday that the NCP was keen on offering the CM’s post to the Sena if Thackeray was willing to snap ties with the BJP and head a regime propped up by the NCP-Congress, their allies and Independents. Given the composition of the new Vidhan Sabha, the NCP president would not fish in troubled waters, said a Vidhan Bhavan official. Uddhav too dismissed the idea, saying he had no “greed” for power. However, he added that he was in no hurry to assume office. “I have lot of time on me,” he remarked in a veiled warning to the BJP that he may be willing to mull over the NCP’s proposal, if any Sena leader Sanjay Raut also held a press conference to dispel all talk of his party teaming up with the NCP. “The new regime will be of the BJP-Sena ‘yuti’ (alliance),” said Raut. It was Thackeray who instructed Raut to clarify doubts about the Sena joining hands with the NCP in a bid to reassure a nervous BJP, it is learnt.

Maharashtra assembly elections: BJP gallops to bigger win than Shiv Sena in Mumbai | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The BJP has stolen a march over the Shiv Sena by winning 16 of the total 36 state assembly seats in Mumbai while the latter annexed 14. The assembly poll results were announced on Thursday. The state assembly elections will have far-reaching consequences for the 2022 BMC elections, said political observers. The BJP lagged behind the Sena tally of 84 only by two in the 2017 Mumbai civic elections. While the BJP may have suffered a dent in other parts of the state, it retained its electoral clout in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, bagging 12 assembly seats in Thane and Raigad districts. The Sena tally is five. Aditya Thackeray’s handsome victory in the Worli constituency brought cheer across Sena’s shakhas. On the other hand, Mumbai mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar’s defeat in Bandra (East), just a stone’s throw from Matoshree, came as a jolt. BJP winners are fairly sprinkled across the city: Education minister Ashish Shelar (Bandra West), junior minister Yogesh Sagar (Charkop), Atul Bhatkhalkar (Kandivli East), Vidya Thakur (Goregaon), city BJP chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha (Malabar Hill), Parag Alavani (Vile Parle), Amit Satam (Andheri West) and Manisha Chaudhary (Dahisar), to name a few. Ramesh Singh Thakur, BJP candidate from Malad (West), popular as Malvani, lost to Aslam Shaikh, the Congressman who is set to begin his third term as MLA. “Shaikh was leading in the first two rounds followed by a setback till the 13th round. Thereafter, he regained his lead till the last,” said poll manager Ameya Bhosale. “Mumbaikars took cognizance of the infrastructure projects being implemented by the Fadnavis government in Mumbai and voted generously for the BJP,” said Satam, who had a surprise guest— Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s brother Pankaj Modi —as his VIP campaigner during the last phase of electioneering. “Pankajbhai is a dear friend. I have known him for many years,” said Satam. Among BJP’s first-timers in the lotus-shaped Vidhan Bhavan are Parag Shah (Ghatkopar West), Mihir Kotecha (Mulund), Sunil Rane (Borivli) and Rahul Narwekar (Colaba). Narwekar joined the BJP as poll drums began to beat last month. A senior BJP functionary from Worli, Rane was sent off to Borivli after the party denied nomination to minister for cultural affairs Vinod Tawde. Kalidas Kolambkar, who defected from the Sena to the Congress in 2006 and joined the BJP in the run-up to the state assembly election, will be the senior-most member of the house— his eighth consecutive term. Kolambkar won from Wadala. Sena stalwarts, including minister Ravindra Waikar, Sunil Prabhu, Sada Sarvankar, Sanjay Potnis, Sunil Raut and Prakash Surve are back in the assembly, indicating the Sena has retained its hold over its bastions. Mumbai Congress leaders Amin Patel and Warsha Gayakwad won from their strongholds—Mumbadevi and Dharavi, respectively. Nawab Malik, the lone NCP candidate, won the Anushakti Nagar seat, trouncing Sena’s Tukaram Kate, while Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi won from Mankhurd-Shivaji Nagar constituency.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Sharad Pawar slows BJP, Shiv Sena seeks more power | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray began hard negotiations with the BJP over power-sharing on Thursday afternoon by demanding that the allies adopt, in the wake of their victory in the Maharashtra assembly elections, the “50:50” formula suggested by him to the central BJP leadership earlier this year. The formula entails equal distribution of ministerial berths and sharing of the CM’s post for 2.5 years each. The demand came even as results showed that though the saffron combine had returned to power as expected with 161 seats, the BJP’s tally had fallen by 17—from 122 in 2014, when the saffron parties had contested separately, to 105—and that of the Sena by 7, from 63 to 56. Senior BJP sources said the demand for splitting the CM term was not likely to pass muster given the clear difference in numbers between the two parties. The ministerial representation will also need to take numbers into account, though the issue of portfolios would certainly require greater attention, sources added. The two sides might be in for a few days of negotiations even as PM Narendra Modi told cadres at the BJP headquarters in Delhi that Devendra Fadnavis will be CM for a full (second) term. The Sena has said the formula for the Vidhan Sabha polls was discussed at a meeting between Uddhav, BJP chief Amit Shah and Fadnavis held before the Lok Sabha elections. At a presser, Uddhav said, “Under this formula, the Sena should have got 144 of the total 288 seats for the assembly elections. However, (state BJP president) Chandrakant Patil told me in the course of our seat-sharing talks that I should understand the BJP’s difficulties and give up my demand for 144 seats. This I did, but now I want the 50:50 formula to be implemented with the utmost transparency.” He added, “After all, I too have to run my party.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Nationalism started big, then gave way to local issues for parties | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: While BJP came in for criticism for talking about its decision to revoke Article 370 in the Maharashtra assembly elections, the issue nonetheless was one of the dominant ones in the poll campaign. The verdict may be split on whether it worked, but whether the BJPSena combine would have been able to beat back anti-incumbency with the same vigour without it is not clear. PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah tried to carry forward the discourse on nationalism. While bringing up Pakistan, they also placed a lot of focus on the NCP’s alleged links with the underworld. However, towards the end of the campaign, the narrative somewhat changed. PM Modi, for instance, devoted a greater portion of his speech at the Bandra-Kurla Complex last week — nearly 20 minutes — to Mumbai’s issues: the Metro network, the Navi Mumbai international airport and the trans-harbour link, ‘ease of living’ and Rera, and he assured the city’s voters that the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, in its second term, would chalk up a comprehensive, time-bound plan for Mumbai’s development. “The Punjab Maharashtra Co-operative Bank scandal stirred the city’s conscience, but netas didn’t talk much on the shutdown of cooperative banks,” said Vivek Surve, a young professional. “On the other hand, talking of farmers’ distress and delay in completing irrigation projects would mean admitting one’s own failure. No leader would dare do that,” he added. The opposition Congress-NCP combine did put together a poll agenda, but it seemed more occupied with working out local political calculations and caste equations, said political analysts. CM Fadnavis spoke about making the state droughtfree, a slogan that appears to have brought dividends in the arid Marathwada region where the saffron alliance won a majority of the seats. His focus on his pet project, the Jalyukt Shivar scheme, was also welcomed by people of this region. MNS candidates spoke evocatively about their leader Raj Thackeray’s ‘blueprint’ for revamping civic amenities. “But voters want quick-fix solutions,” said Archies Patil, a computer graduate.

Maharashtra assembly elections: BJP takes control of Navi Mumbai | Navi Mumbai News - Times of India,"NAVI MUMBAI: The BJP took control of Navi Mumbai by winning three of the area's four assembly seats (Panvel, Belapur and Airoli) and indirectly supporting the independent winner of the fourth seat in Uran. Before the contest, BJP had managed to keep Sena out of the area by allotting them only Uran constituency in the seat-sharing formula. Local leaders also indirectly supported the BJP rebel who stood as an independent, defeating the Sena's nominee. Most observers felt that the results of Panvel, Belapur and Airoli were a foregone conclusion given the leads that the BJP-Sena Lok Sabha candidates had got in these constituencies in the LS election. Besides, the opposition was thrown off balance with NCP strongman Ganesh Naik and his son Sandeep joining the BJP. Ganesh Naik was allocated Airoli, much to the anger of local Sena workers. Meanwhile, several societies in Kharghar gave out calls for boycott of polls angered due to the apathy of the local administration on civic and infrastructure issues. A large number of NOTA votes too were cast. But all these seemed to have had little effect on the outcome. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Mixed bag for defectors: Several bite the dust, others score. Import strategy dents BJP image | Mumbai News - Times of India","The crushing defeat of Shivaji descendant Udayanraje Bhosale from Satara must be among the sweetest victories for NCP chief Sharad Pawar. Bhosale was the most high-profile turncoat, who had jumped ship from NCP to BJP in the poll run-up. Bhosale lost the parliamentary bypoll in Satara by over 87,000 votes just a week after Pawar addressed a rain-soaked rally there, saying he regretted fielding him for the Lok Sabha polls in May. After the results, Pawar said, ""Defections have not been accepted by the people, with some exceptions."" The saffron parties had engineered a flood of defections from Congress and NCP shortly before the polls, mocked by the opposition as ""mega-bharti"". The main defections were from NCP to BJP, a strategy of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to weaken Pawar's party in its citadel, the sugar belt of Western Maharashtra, and gain control over the cooperative institutions controlled by NCP satraps. Despite the crossovers, NCP improved its tally in the region. Indeed, BJP appears to have paid the price for the ""imports"", which impacted its image and led to a rise in party rebels. Besides Bhosale, several prominent turncoats who tasted defeat included former ministers like Harshavardhan Patil, who quit Congress to join BJP and lost from Indapur, and Jayadutta Kshirsagar, who switched from NCP to Shiv Sena and was defeated in Beed. Vaibhav Pichad, the son of former minister Madhukarao Pichad and who went from NCP to BJP, lost from Akole. Former minister Dilip Sopal (NCP to Sena) lost from Barshi. But many key defectors-11 of 19-won. These include: former state Congress chief Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who joined BJP and won from Shirdi; Rana Jagjitsinh Patil (son of one-time Pawar confidante Padamsinh Patil), who ditched NCP for BJP and won from Tuljapur in Marathwada; Navi Mumbai strongman Ganesh Naik, who won from Airoli after quitting NCP for BJP; Kankavli's sitting MLA Nitesh Rane (son of Narayan Rane) scored despite switching from Congress to BJP. In the same region, former minister Bhaskar Jadhav (NCP to Sena) won from Guhagar. Shivaji descendant Shivendrasinh Bhosale (NCP to BJP along with cousin Udayanraje) won Satara. Congress veteran Abdul Sattar won Sillod after joining Sena. Kalidas Kolambkar (Congress to BJP) retained Wadala. Fadnavis's import strategy may have led to bigger losses than gains. ""It sullied the image of BJP among voters and led to a rise in rebellion among BJP leaders, who were ignored in favour of defectors,"" said political analyst Abhay Deshpande. Indeed, NCP had accused BJP of threatening its leaders with cases to force them to jump ship. The big question now is how BJP will accommodate all heavyweight defectors in key posts, when there already are so many aspirants within BJP.

"Mumbai elects five women MLAs again, Maharashtra has 23 in all | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The newly elected 288-member Maharashtra Legislative Assembly will have 23 women — 11 of them sitting legislators. Still, this is an improvement over the previous 2014 election, when only 20 women were elected to the lower house. The prominent loser among women leaders is BJP leader Pankaja Munde who lost from Parli. Among 3,237 candidates, there were 235 women candidates. Keeping the tally in the city the same as last year, Mumbai has once again elected five women MLAs. Four of these have been re-elected, while one is a first-time MLA. So, of the total 36 MLAs in the city, women comprise 14% of the MLAs. Repeating their terms are BJP MLAs Bharti Lavekar from Versova, Vidya Thakur from Goregaon, Manisha Chaudhary from Dahisar and Congress MLA Varsha Gaikwad. Shiv Sena did not give a ticket to sitting MLA from Bandra east Trupti Sawant, but got a new MLA in Yamini Jadhav who won the Byculla seat by defeating lone AIMIM leader Waris Pathan. “This is not my victory alone, it is the victory of the people of Dharavi,” said Gaikwad, who won for the fourth time from Dharavi. Female voter turnout in this election was 59.21%, while the male voter turnout was 62.89%.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: BJP loses 17 seats, Sena 7 as saffron alliance’s majority far short of expectation of 200+ | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, which had set for itself a stiff target of winning more than 220 seats in the Maharashtra assembly elections out of the total 288, fell considerably short of its own expectations on Thursday. Though its combined tally of 161 meant it crossed the halfway mark comfortably, both the BJP and Sena had reason to feel dissatisfied that they had not only failed to completely bulldoze a depleted and apparently demoralized opposition but had come up with reduced numbers, the BJP score dropping from 122 in the 2014 polls to 105 and the Sena’s from 63 to 56. Sharad Pawar’s beleaguered NCP was chiefly responsible for slowing the saffron march, winning 54 seats as against just 41in 2014, while the Congress, which had been the senior partner in the secular front earlier with 42 seats, added just two more to its tally despite the BJP-Sena's fiveyear incumbency period. The BJP and Sena had fought the 2014 polls separately and had later forged a postpoll alliance. This time, with the tie-up securely back in place, the BJP, fresh on the back of its thumping Lok Sabha victory and popular endorsement of the Modi government’s move to revoke Article 370, was hoping to reach the majority mark of 145 on its own, while the Sena was aiming at 100 seats for itself. Largescale defections from the NCP and Congress, leaders of the saffron combine hoped, would further cripple the opposition. The saffron allies, however, lost several seats that they held in the famous sugar belt of Western Maharashtra, where Pawar led the NCP to a comeback, and disappointingly for CM Devendra Fadnavis, in his Vidarbha region, where the Congress clawed back, bagging 17 of 62 seats against all expectations. In touch with 15 rebels who’ll soon return to saffron camp, says CMThough cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Nashik favoured the saffron alliance more than the opposition, its defeat in two of the six seats in Fadnavis’ hometown Nagpur came as a setback for a combine that relies heavily on urban voters. A bigger setback was the defeat of eight ministers in the state cabinet, including the late Gopinath Munde’s daughter Pankaja Munde from Parli in Beed district. Most exit polls had given less than 100 seats to the opposition, and with the best projection for the BJP-Sena alliance at 243, the BJP-Sena had expected an unprecedented mandate especially after NCP and Congress netas left their parties in significant numbers after the LS polls to be on the winning side. The results were a mixed bag for these turncoats, with those like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil (Shirdi), Nitesh Rane (Kankavli) and Ganesh Naik (Airoli) winning and Harshwardhan Patil (Indapur), Vaibhav Pichad (Akole) and Jaydutta Kshirsagar (Beed) losing in their pocketboroughs. Fadnavis said the BJP-Sena tally had been hit more by rebels than by the opposition and claimed he was in touch with “15 rebels” who would soon return to the saffron camp. Of the smaller parties, Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, which ended its alliance with the AIMIM after the LS polls, drew a blank. The VBA-MIM tie-up had cost the Congress-NCP front at least five seats in the LS polls. Asaduddin Owaisi’s party lost both the seats it had won in 2014 (Byculla and Aurangabad) but made up for it with victories in two other seats, Malegaon and Dhule city.

Maharashtra assembly elections: Shiv Sena creates history in Byculla with its first-ever win | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena’s Yamini Jadhav created history by winning the Byculla assembly constituency seat. This is the first time that the Sena has won this seat. It is the same constituency from where Mohammed Ali Jinnah had contested the Indian provincial elections in 1946 and won. For this win, Sena may reward Jadhav with a ministerial berth. Jadhav, a commerce graduate and former corporator, secured 51,180 votes and defeated AIMIM’s sitting MLA Waris Pathan by 20,023 votes. Congress’ Annna Madhu Chavan stood third with 24,139 votes. Others in the fray included Geeta Gawli, daughter of Arun Gawli of the Akhil Bharatiya Sena.  “I am thankful to the people of Byculla constituency. They worked for me and ensured my victory. I will work for all communities. I will establish drug deaddiction centres and work to repair old buidlings, which are the major issues here,” said Jadhav after she was declared a winner. Jadhav got 41% of the total votes. Her husband, Yeshwant Jadhav, is the BMC’s standing committee chairman. Arvind Sawant, Sena MP, had won the parliamentary seat which includes Byculla for the second time this year. This seat has been won by AIMIM, Congress, CPI and Janta Dal in the past. “This time, there were anti-incumbency votes. People were not happy with Pathan’s work.

Maharashtra assembly elections: Narayan Rane ensures BJP gains toehold in coastal bastion of ally Shiv Sena | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Narayan Rane oversaw the victory of his son Nitesh as he helped the BJP make inroads into the Shiv Sena bastion of Konkan. There are eight assembly constituencies in Sindhdurg and Ratnagiri districts. Of the five seats in Ratnagiri, the Shiv Sena won four and the NCP only one, Chiplun. In Sindhdurg, of the three seats, the Shiv Sena won two and the BJP won one. The Congress was wiped out from this part of the Konkan. ""In Sawantwadi and Kudal assembly constituencies our candidates secured over 50,000 votes. This would not have been possible without Rane,"" Pramod Jathar, BJP district president, Sindhdurg, said. Sindhudurg was the only district where alliance partners BJP and Shiv Sena pitted their candidates against each other in what was described by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray as a ""friendly fight"". It was anything but friendly as the BJP used Rane to gain a foothold in the Shiv Sena stronghold. The NCP had lost the Chiplun seat in the 2014 assembly election. The party lost the Dapoli and Guhagar seats, which it had won the last time. Guhagar MLA Bhaskar Jadhav contested on a Shiv Sena ticket this time and won. Jathar was categorical that the BJP and Sena should have formed an alliance only after the assembly election. ""It sent a confusing message to the people. In Sindhudurg the BJP could have won all the three seats had there been no alliance to start with. The Kankavli seat was won by the BJP by a margin of 30,000 seats, while the Sena won the Sawantwadi and Kudal seats by a margin of hardly 13,000 and 15,000 votes,"" he said. Shiv Sena politician Subhash Desai said the party wanted to defeat Rane. ""The grassroot Sena worker is not willing to forget or forgive the senior Rane's utterances against Balasaheb Thackeray. We do not want such tendencies in Maharashtra politics,"" he said. On the Sena victories, he said the tally could have been better. ""Our alliance is victorious. We will introspect and examine what went wrong. We'll now concentrate on implementing our manifesto,"" he said. Narayan Rane, who was a mellowed version of his usual self during the campaign, said his son's victory was a fitting reply from the people to those who betrayed him. Local journalist Rajan Chavan said the election results were an indication of the beginning of the fight between the Sena and Rane, and in turn the BJP, for control of the two districts.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Multiple candidates split Muslim vote, but Congress makes minor gains | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The tally of Muslim MLAs in the state rose to 10 this election, up from nine in 2014, but that number may have been higher if the presence of multiple Muslim candidates had not split the votes in several constituencies. In the textile town of Bhiwandi West, for instance, winning BJP candidate Prabhakar Chaugle benefited from the fragmentation of Muslim votes among three candidates—Independent Khalid Guddu, Congress’s Shoeb Guddu and BSP’s Abusama Khan. By contrast, in Bhiwandi East, SP’s Rais Shaikh was able to defeat Shiv Sena’s Rupesh Mhatre with a slender margin of 956 votes. “Unlike Bhiwandi East where there was a near consensus among majority of Muslims on Rais Shaikh,” said Bhiwandi-based senior Urdu journalist Akhtar Kazmi, adding, “The same couldn’t happen in Bhiwandi West and the two Guddus divided the votes.” Similarly, in Aurangabad Central, which was held by MIM’s Imtiaz Jaleel before he won the Lok Sabha seat this year, Shiv Sena’s Pradeep Jaiswal won by 12678 votes as MIM’s Naseeruddin Siddiqui and NCP’s Abdul Qadeer divided a significant chunk of the minority votes. “[The community] frittered away their votes in many constituencies while they could have backed secular parties,” observed political scientist Zahir Ali. Ali said that MIM’s focus on emotive identity issues helped the saffron alliance to consolidate Hindu votes. MIM kept its tally of two seats-—Shah Faruk Anwar won in Dhule City and Mohammed Ismail in Malegaon Central. But the party lost Byculla and Aurangabad Central. The presence of VBA and MIM candidates is thought to have damaged Congress-NCP in some seats. But SP increased its tally from one to two MLAS in the state. And Abdul Sattar, who abandoned Congress to join the Sena, won the Sillod seat with an impressive margin of 24381 votes. Some 31 constituencies in the state have substantial Muslim populations.

The election office turned down Khan's plea for recounting of votes at a few select centres after an almost three-hour-long drama.

Undeterred by his bad health and bleeding foot, he toured over 100 constituencies, addressing 68 public meetings and on Thursday it translated into 53 seats for his Nationalist Congress Party: higher than Congress' and almost on par with Shiv Sena, though, obviously, lesser than what he wanted. On Thursday evening Pawar spoke at length to the media on the implications of the verdict. Excerpts:Q: How do you look at the outcome of the assembly elections?  A: We accept the verdict. Fadnavis was claiming that the saffron combine would win over 220 seats. It was a hollow claim. BJP-Shiv Sena have paid the price for arrogance and gross abuse of power. I am in politics for last more than five and half decades but have never seen such a political situation. For the first time Maharashtra witnessed a very low level of campaign. Power comes and goes. We have increased our tally. It's the beginning of change. Q: Just a month ago your trusted aides quit to join BJP or Shiv Sena.  A: It was a wrong decision. Most of the defectors have been rejected by the people. Satara Lok Sabha member Udayanraje Bhosale had lot of respect as he's the descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Without any specific reason, he quit to join the BJP. He lost by a huge margin. Q: Along with you , now the ED is probing Praful Patel.  A: I reiterate that the BJP-led government is misusing the central investigating agencies for settling political scores. It's all vendetta politics. Entire action is politically motivated. Opposition members are being targeted. I received a notice from ED for the cooperative bank scam. I am not associated with it in any manner. Q: Reports say Shiv Sena is keen on forming the government with the Congress-NCP combine .  A: I have no such information. In fact, we are not keen on forming a government with Shiv Sena. Since the saffron combine has a clear majority, it will form the government. So far as the Congress-NCP front is concerned, we have the mandate to sit in the opposition. We play the role of constructive opposition. Q: Is this a mandate against CM Fadnavis or the BJP-led government?  A: It's a not the question of mandate, people have expressed displeasure over the government's performance. Despite the PM, Amit Shah, top BJP cabinet members, and CMs of BJP-ruled states extensively campaigning in the state the BJP still does not have the numbers to form a government on its own.

NOTA be ignored: 113% rise in Mumbai voters rejecting all candidates | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Nearly 1.45 lakh Mumbaikars expressed their frustration with the government by punching None Of The Above (NOTA) — an option that saw a remarkable 113% jump in votes from 2014. The sharp rise in NOTA votes reflects anger over issues like the tree felling for a Metro car shed in Aarey Colony and the collapse of the Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative Bank, according to experts. Jogeshwari (East), which hosts the contested Aarey forest, saw the highest number of NOTA votes being cast: 12,031. That’s a sixfold rise from 2014, and a startling 8.08% of the overall vote in this constituency. The numbers left winning candidate Ravindra Waikar from Shiv Sena stunned. “People were clearly upset with Aarey and PMC,” he said. Overall, nearly 3% of the 49.28 lakh votes cast in Mumbai were for NOTA, compared to 1.30 % in 2014. In Borivali, which had the second highest number of NOTA votes, the option was the third most popular choice after the BJP and Congress despite two other candidates. Observers said that they were surprised given the apparent lack of burning issues in this area. In Mulund, Andheri East, Sion-Koliwada and Bhandup, where the fall of PMC Bank has been a big issue, bank depositors are thought to have contributed to substantial NOTA votes. Even some BJP strongholds saw an increase in NOTA votes. Ghatkopar East saw NOTA votes almost double from 1,850 in 2014 to 3,294 this year. Worli, where Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray won, saw a fourfold rise in NOTA to over 6,000 votes. A Shiv Sena functionary said that it was time to review why so many people had rejected all candidates. The trend was present in the rest of the metropolitan region. NOTA votes more than doubled in Palghar, comprising 7,135 or 5.51% of votes, compared to 1.95% in 2016. That may have been due to Shiv Sena choosing Shrinivas Vanga over sitting MLA Amit Ghoda, as well as the controversial bullet train project, said observers. Thane district’s 18 seats saw 73,800 NOTA votes cast, nearly 2.40 % of the total. And in Panvel’s 10-candidate election, NOTA came in third after BJP and PWP, capturing 12,399 of 3.02 lakh votes. The increase in NOTA suggests people are beginning to understand the potency of the choice, said political analyst Ajit Ranade. “It’s a signal to political parties to put up better candidates,” he said.

Maharashtra election: Shiv Sena hopes Aaditya Thackeray’s debut win will land him a cabinet berth | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena youth leader Aaditya Thackeray’s successful win from the Worli constituency in his first attempt at electoral politics has led to speculation that he could get a ministerial berth. While Shiv Sena president and Aaditya’s father Uddhav Thackeray is delighted with the “son rise” in the party and satisfied with the overall performance, he has reminded the BJP of the original “50:50” power-sharing formula that the saffron allies had finalised before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Political deliberations by the Sena will include bargaining for the post of deputy chief minister for the first half of the five-year term and claim for the post of chief minister in the second. Aaditya—the first Thackeray to contest elections— won by a comfortable margin of 67,000-plus votes over his nearest rival from NCP, Suresh Mane; Aaditya got 89,248 votes and led in all 18 rounds. Aaditya (29) has degrees in arts and law. After taking over as chief of Yuva Sena, the Sena’s youth wing, in 2010, Aaditya began to take a keen interest in matters related to education, including senate elections, and raising issues concerning exams and delay in results. His entry into the legislature is expected to pave the way for him to gain a tighter grip over the party’s functioning and play a role in decision-making. “Only ministers can enter both houses—legislative assembly and council. Hence, if Aaditya wants to learn the culture of both the houses, he must be a part of the cabinet. Else, no MLA is allowed to enter the upper house,” said a Sena functionary. “Also, during the first two years, he could learn about protocols before taking charge of the sixth floor of the chief minister’s office at Mantralaya.” Uddhav said, “We are proud of the fact that Aaditya took the decision on his own to contest the elections and has won it with a good margin. He always had our (parents) blessings, but now he has the blessings of scores of citizens.” When Aaditya reached the counting centre to collect his victory certificate accompanied by brother Tejas and senior party functionaries, TOI asked him about being projected as the state’s next chief minister. To this, he replied, “All the equations and formulae have been spoken about by the party president and my father. Let’s wait and watch.

Bandra East saw one of the biggest upsets as rank newcomer Zeeshan Siddique of the Congress defeated mayor and Sena strongman Vishwanath Mahadeshwar by over 5,000 votes. Zeeshan polled 38,337 votes while Mahadeshwar secured 32,547. In Round 12, Siddique’s vote count touched 20,140 and Mahadeshwar’s 23,440. After that, though, the numbers rose quickly for the youngster and his winning margin kept rising to good result. In Malad West, Congressman Aslam Shaikh may have won his seat with a comfortable margin of 10,383 votes but the 20 rounds of counting that led to the final result ended up being a roller-coaster ride for him and his closest competitor, BJP’s Thakur Ramesh Singh. In Boisar, just when it seemed the Sena was comfortably placed for a win the BVA first-timer Rajesh Patil ended the race in victory. Sena had fielded sitting MLA Vilas Tare who hoped for a hat-trick. He was on top of the chart when counting began. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra elections: Won't contest polls in future, says Hitendra Thakur | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Five-time MLA and Vasai assembly seat candidate Hitendra Thakur of the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) said he will not contest any elections in the future but will continue to be in politics. Speaking to mediapersons a day after voting for the assembly polls took place, Thakur said this election had taught him what politics should not be. ""I have decided to not contest any future elections. In the next five years, we will groom our activists so they can take care of the seat,"" said Thakur, adding he will however remain in politics. Thakur (58) is pitted against Vijay Patil of Shiv Sena. The BVA leader said he would win this election with a margin of at least 50,000 votes.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Shiv Sena, NCP both claim gains as Anushakti Nagar voting jumps | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Both the main contenders at Anushakti Nagar near Chembur - NCP's Nawab Malik and Shiv Sena's Tukaram Kate - claimed they would benefit from the bigger turnout of 55.1% this time against 46.8% in 2014. ""There was a lot of disenchantment with Kate's style of functioning and the majority of voters have rejected him. I am confident of winning this seat,"" said Malik, the NCP's spokesperson. Kate is the incumbent MLA while Malik had won the seat in 2009. Kate said the people's support was with him overwhelmingly and he would retain his seat. ""I have done a lot of work, especially brought water connections to the slum areas which were denied of water for the last 40 years,"" he added. Kate is also banking on the BJP-Sena alliance. ""In 2014, we fought separately and the margin of my victory was very low (1,007 votes). This time we were together and there hasn't been much damage to my traditional base of Maharashtrian and North Indian voters."" He claimed that at least 10% Muslim voters have gone with him. Activist Saeed Khan said Malik's accessibility to voters cutting across communities might have swung a huge chunk of non-Muslim votes in his favour. ""He visits people's homes on festivals like Diwali and Dussehra and I could see the enthusiasm among the non-Muslim voters for Malik. In fact, in his nomination rally, the non-Muslim supporters outnumbered the Muslims,"" said Khan. Voters in huge numbers were seen stepping out of their homes from areas near Payalipada, Cheeta Camp and Mankhurd station. But how much has MIM candidate Shahnawaz Shaikh damaged Malik? ""Shahnawaz fell ill during campaign and his group got splintered. Many of the boys who were campaigning for him joined Malik's team. He won't hurt much,"" said an activist at Payalipada. Shaikh couldn't be contacted for comments. ""Whoever wins, it is good that more people turned out to vote in this locality,"" said a scientist at BARC, requesting anonymity.

Maharashtra elections: Awareness campaigns fail to generate votes in Bandra | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: At 43.9%, Bandra West was among those constituencies that recorded the poorest voter turnout in the city. A further bifurcation shows that areas in the constituency such as Bandra Reclamation and Nargis Dutt Nagar saw even less than 40% turnout. This came as a surprise, especially since the assembly is known to have several resident associations whose members were active in spreading the message of asking people to vote. On election day, when TOI visited various polling centres in the constituency such as St Anne's School at Pali Hill, Mount Mary Convent High School and St Stanislaus High School on Hill Road, no queues were to be seen. It was at a few centres such as Supari Tank Municipal School that people began to queue up but only from early evening. AGNI trustee Shyama Kulkarni said the Election Commission (EC) took great effort to ensure a smooth voting day but voters failed to come out in large numbers. Vidya Vaidya from H-West Federation said the EC had a meeting with advanced locality management members, asking them to pass on the message to vote. Asif Zakeria, Congress candidate from the constituency, said low turnout at areas such as Nargis Dutt Nagar showed that a lot of minority community members did not vote. Sources said razing of slums had caused resentment. ""The PMC Bank issue and Aarey tree felling also upset people. We hoped for a better turnout, though, as the ward has several well-informed and active residents,"" said Zakeria. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said the low turnout was due to lack of opposition in the constituency. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Swing factor? Voting falls in 10 opposition-held seats in Maharashtra elections | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The EC's final turnout figure for the state for Monday's polling was 61.13%, which was still less than the 63.2% in this year's Lok Sabha polls and 63.1% in the 2014 state polls. The final Mumbai figure was 50.4%, of which 48.2% was for the island city and 51.2% the suburbs. In Mumbai and across the state, an analysis of the EC's figures shows that turnout has merely dipped in a majority of the 83 seats which were with Congress-NCP. However, the voting pattern shows a big drop - up to 16% - in 10 seats, which may prove to be a swing factor. Of these 10, two constituencies are those from which the Bhujbals are contesting and another is Shirdi, contested by former opposition leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, who crossed over to BJP after the Lok Sabha polls. Nandgaon in north Maharashtra recorded a 51.2% turnout, a steep drop of 16% compared to the 67.7% in 2014. Two-time NCP MLA Pankaj is contesting for the third time from this constituency. In 2014, he had bagged over 69,000 votes while Sena and BJP, which contested separately, managed to get over 50,000 each. Since they are now contesting in alliance, it would be a cause of concern for Bhujbal. Former deputy chief minister Chhagan is contesting from Yewla, which recorded a 7% turnout fall to 63%. Surendra Jondhale, a political analyst, reminded that usually, a shrinking turnout would be a cause for concern for the sitting MLA, irrespective of whether from the ruling party or the opposition. He said anti-incumbency and the candidates' part switch may have led to the dip in turnout. In the city, the turnout at Chandivali, held by Congress' Naseem Khan, has seen a rise to 51.7% from 44.3% in 2014. The vote percentage fell by 11% in Ahmednagar (City) from 59% (in 2014) to 48%. The seat is with NCP's Sangram Jagtap, who had defeated five-time Sena MLA Anil Rathod, buoyed by the vote split between Sena and BJP in 2014. Jagtap won by a mere 3,000 votes, while Sena bagged over 46,000 votes and BJP almost 40,000. Congress stood forth rank with 27,000 votes. The Sena-BJP alliance has again fielded Rathod. The turnout was also down marginally (a shade less than 4%) in Kankavli in Ratnagiri, where incumbent Nitesh Rane has again been fielded, but this time by BJP. Sena has fielded a candidate against him. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

The Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and the Verified Voter Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines were dispatched to the strong rooms till 5am on Tuesday. The counting will commence at 8am on October 24. The collector said that with the heavy rains in the city and rural areas, the officials faced hurdles in transportation and completed the entire process in the early hours of Tuesday. The EVMs were sealed before the concerned officials, he said. The EVM machines from eight assembly constituencies were kept at the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godown, from three assembly constituencies of Pimrpi Chinchwad were kept at the Balewadi stadium. In the rural areas, the EVMs were stored at various halls and institutes, ahead of the counting day. An official told TOI that there was no issue during the process of sealing. At present, the EVMs are stored in the respective strong rooms, which have double seal. The sealing process takes place in front of the polling officers, candidates and their representatives and the CCTV cameras are operational at the strong rooms round-the-clock, the official said. An official said they had followed all the ECI guidelines, with the help of police officers, to keep the EVM machines under tight security. As per the guidelines, there is a three-layer security arrangement with the help of the police staff, Central Para Military Forces (CPMF) and even CCTV cameras. As per the guidelines, they have to guard the inner circle of the strong rooms where the EVMs are kept, the outer parameter is secured by the state armed constabulary and local police or the District Executive Force is deployed on the streets.

Maharashtra elections: Chandivali glows with 50-plus score | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Voters from both the posh enclaves of Hiranandani, Nahar Amrit Shakti or Raheja Vihar and the underdeveloped and crowded Jari Mari and Saki Naka have together contributed to an almost 8% rise in the turnout this elections in Chandivli, helping the city along to a barely respectable 50+ percentage. In fact, it is the constituency's highest turnout in the last three elections; and five, if the larger Kurla constituency before delimitation is taken into account. Of the 3.8 lakh voters, 51.7% came out to vote on Monday. The last time the region recorded a 50+ turnout was in 1995, when it came under the Kurla constituency. Then the turnout was 56.2%, and Shiv Sena won. Since 1999, the seat has been retained by four-time Congress MLA Arif (Naseem) Khan. Interestingly, the turnout in the seat has not crossed 45% in these polls. Yet, Chandivli is one of the very few Congress seats the party hopes to retain in this election. Facing Khan is Shiv Sena's Dilip Lande and representatives from parties such as Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, AAP and AIMIM, who were not contesting in the last election. Khan told TOI a drive was carried out to remove duplicate and bogus names from the voters' list before the Lok Sabha elections this year. ""Once the unnecessary repetitions were removed, we were left with genuine voters. The turnout this year is accurate. During Lok Sabha elections too, we saw a 49% turnout. There has been a 3-4% rise over and above that in the constituency, which is a good sign."" Data on polling at individual centres from the sitting MLA's office reveal that there has been good turnout across booths in the constituency. Durgadevi Municipal School at Powai, which covered several elite housing societies, saw a 56.1% turnout on Monday, higher than the constituency's average. Around 6,200 voters were registered at the centre. St Anthony's High School in Asalfa, Saki Naka, a densely populated region with close to 11,000 voters, saw a turnout of 53.3%. Some of these centres have made up for the lower turnout at centres such as Hiranandani Foundation School (48.6%) and St Jude's High School (49.4%) in Jari Mari, Saki Naka. Elsie Gabriel, a resident and an environmentalist, said people may have stepped out in large numbers as responsible citizens. ""They may not have any favourites as such. Many look for solutions to environment and traffic problems in the constituency,"" she added. Ramzan Chaudhury, an activist from Jari Mari, said there were newer parties in the fray with promising candidates. ""This could have led to a slight increase in the number of voters,"" he said. While the residents in upmarket Hiranandani and Nahar townships may be looking for solutions to their traffic woes, the densely populated slums along Mithi and Jari Mari road are seeking better living conditions, clean water supply and rehabilitation.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Wadala saw biggest drop in polling, 16,000 less than in 2014 | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The Wadala constituency recorded the biggest drop in polling on Monday. Turnout for the 2019 assembly elections was 53.1% against 61.3% in 2014—a nearly 8.2% drop. As many as 16,000 voters who had voted in 2014 stayed away this time. Wadala is also a constituency with the fewest voters in the city at merely two lakh. This number is nearly 1.8 lakh lower than Chandivali, the constituency with maximum voters. A detailed breakup of voting across polling stations shows in minority areas such as Kidwai Nagar, it has increased while at Korba Mithagar, BDD chawls and Hindu Colony it was lower than in 2014. What is also unique is that Wadala’s sitting MLA Kalidas Kolamkar has served seven terms—longest in the city. Kolamkar was initially with the Shiv Sena, then he moved to the Congress and was currently contesting on a BJP ticket. Several residents said there was no motivation to go out and vote. Resident and activist Nikhil Desai said other candidates did not reach out to the public at all and that voters did not have much of a choice. “Congress put up an unknown face who did not even reach out to voters. MNS put up a candidate who had lost in 2014 and the remaining three candidates were independents and people do not vote for them anyway. Rather than voting for the same person over and over again due to lack of choice, voters decided to stay home,” said Desai. A Sena leader from the constituency said the BJP giving a ticket to Kolamkar had upset them and that he was an outsider for the local BJP cadre and so they stayed away from campaigning for him. Congress candidate Shivkumar Lad said the dip in voter turnout was a sign of anti-incumbency and that strongholds of Kolamkar abstained from voting. Kolamkar said the low voter turnout was due to several factors, including offices not giving leave to vote and also a technical snag in EVMs, which led people to turn back without voting.

Maharashtra assembly elections: Turnout in six south Mumbai seats below city average | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Six of the 10 assembly constituencies in the island city recorded a lower turnout than the Mumbai average of 50.4%. The seats where the turnout was below the city average and much below the state average of 61.1% were Colaba, Dharavi, Worli, Sewri, Malabar Hill and Mumbadevi. Colaba, known to be politically aloof, polled the lowest in the state at 40.2%—6% lower than in 2014 and nearly 5% lower than in this year’s Lok Sabha poll. Wadala, though above the city average, has recorded the highest dip in turnout – of 8.2% -- as compared to 2014. Areas like Worli, Sewri and Byculla that were once politically very active also saw a dip in voter turnout. Experts said the change in demographics of these areas has resulted in the death of political awareness. Even political parties are battling disillusionment among cadre in these areas. “In the 1980s, people were politically very active and the MLA was much more important and available. We would spend our Sundays in the party office. People do not have time now and are detached,” said Shyam Mehta, an old-time BJP worker from Sewri. He also said that with chawls being replaced by high-rises, the political class too was wiped out. “Agitations and protests were a part of our youth. We were not scared to hold our MLAs and political representatives accountable, that’s because we used to vote. An MLA used to be scared about not doing our work, but now even the voters are aloof and so are the political leaders,” said Vishakha Patil, an activist from Dadar. Prabhakar Bhumkar (80), a veteran Shiv Sainik and the party’s first shakha pramukh in Naigaum in 1966, said that earlier, the rank and file workers would take it upon themselves to bring voters to the polling booths. “These days the cadre is busy putting its own interests first and the party’s or voters’ interests later. Even the parties do not treat them like they used to earlier. It’s all money-driven,” he said. Experts said that the island city has a large floating population and many also look at it for work and do not identify with it beyond that. “There are many people who come here for work, and they keep their attachment to the city only until that purpose is served. There is no connection beyond that,” said political analyst Surendra Jondhale. Also, the island city has tony areas like Malabar Hill where “there is a class which doesn’t depend on its elected representatives for anything, so there is little interest,” Jondhale said. Nine seats from the suburbs too voted below the city average, with the lowest turnout in Versova (42.3%). Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra assembly election Result: Will get 220+ seats, says Devendra Fadnavis; opposition scoffs | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: A day after Maharashtra’s voters exercised their franchise to elect the next state government, CM Devendra Fadnavis said he was confident of a two-thirds majority for the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, while the Congress-NCP combine claimed that it was all set to wrest power from the saffron allies. The results will be declared on Thursday. The Election Commission on Tuesday provided the final figures for Monday’s turnout. While the revised turnout for the state went up slightly to 61.1% from the provisional figure of 60.5% given by the EC on Monday evening, that for Mumbai dipped marginally, from 50.5% to 50.4%. Fadnavis on Tuesday kept up the   claim he had made in an interview to TOI   last week, saying the BJP-Sena would cross the 220 mark. However, state NCP chief Jayant Patil expressed surprise over the claim, saying the people of Maharashtra were set to reject the saffron combine which had “failed on all fronts”. He said, “Fadnavis failed to tackle the agrarian crisis, rural distress and was unable to halt farmers’ suicides. In the recent past, more than 16,000 farmers committed suicide.” Will come back to power: Congress-NCPWhile most exit polls have indicated a sweep for the saffron alliance, Patil said he didn’t want to go into the numbers game. But he said he was sure the Congress, NCP and other like-minded parties would form the government. “It’s a fact that TV channels have given a clear majority for the saffron combine, but there are no takers for these surveys,” Patil said. Endorsing Patil’s views, AICC general secretary Avinash Pande said it would not be possible for Fadnavis to retain power. “Fadnavis has missed the opportunity to provide able leadership, and the people of Maharashtra have not voted in the name of PM Modi or the CM. We will come back to power, that too with a huge majority,” Pande claimed. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra elections 2019: What the big four brought to the fore | Mumbai News - Times of India,"Leaders of the BJP trumpeted the state government’s achievements, the Shiv Sena put out a populist manifesto, and both Congress and NCP fought with their backs to the wall, hoping to make a comeback after a five-year political exile.CM Devendra Fadnavis, BJPBegan the poll campaign before all the others by launching the Maha Janadesh Yatra early in August. Toured the state more extensively than any other neta from any party. The yatra was interrupted by floods in parts of the state but it was resumed once relief work was over, and as Fadnavis cherrypicked one neta after another from the opposition camp, the campaign led by him gathered more steam. If his “I’ll be back as CM” was meant to disabuse ally Shiv Sena of its grand ambition to grab the state’s top post, PM Modi’s assertion of ‘Narendra in New Delhi and Devendra in Maharashtra’ being a ‘hit jodi’ and BJP chief Amit Shah’s statement that he was the undisputed leader in the state further boosted Fadnavis’s poll drive while at the same time further decimating his opponents within BJP. His “look into your own record” put-down of Sharad Pawar after the latter criticised him for accepting defectors in the BJP kept him on the front foot, making it clear that he would continue to hook bouncers rather than duck. Balasaheb Thorat, CongressThe most lacklustre campaign was run by the Grand Old Party. It suffered from a clear and identifiable face who’d have mass appeal across the state. Balasaheb Thorat was appointed state chief just ahead of the campaign and perhaps didn’t have enough time to stamp his presence especially outside his native region of Ahmednagar, where he’s supposed to challenge “turncoat” Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, the erstwhile Congressman who was leader of opposition before he joined BJP. Rahul Gandhi’s trip abroad during the campaign didn’t help the party’s morale and its image either though Rahul sought to make up for it by addressing at least two rallies in Mumbai and another in Ausa where the CM has put up his secretary as a candidate. Uddhav Thackeray, Shiv SenaThe Sena launched its campaign with a public climbdown when it accepted fewer seats in the saffron alliance (124) than it has contested before. But Uddhav put a spin on it by saying he was doing it all in the interests of the state and for the welfare of its citizens so that the Congress-NCP don’t return to power. While saying that he himself is “very much around and not going away” just because son Aaditya has taken the plunge into electoral politics, junior’s candidature and campaign is something which must have certainly brought cheer, especially having zeroed in on the “safe” Worli seat for his poll debut. Also made populist promises during the campaign such as the Re 1 health check-up and ?10 thali. Sharad Pawar, NCPAt the age of 79, Pawar carried out the most aggressive campaign among all the opposition leaders. Lost several longtime colleagues as they abandoned him to flock to the BJP-Sena camp. Pawar sensed an opportunity to return to form after the ED named him in its FIR in the state co-operative bank embezzlement case. Pawar’s hope would be that the government’s alleged targeting of him and his family using the investigative agencies would work in his favour, especially in the sugar bowl of western Maharashtra which is the NCP citadel. That’s the reason he has chiefly focused on government’s alleged misuse of power in his criticism of the Modi-Shah-Fadnavis trio. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Though we did not see much campaigning for these elections we are hoping that the elected leaders can give a hearing to the demands of the youth,’’said Parth Nathwani, a young voter The rain may not dampen a young voter who had planned a Diwali trip with her friends. She said she would vote before heading out on Monday but is hoping that leaders help translate the present education system into jobs. “All government institutes should be able to get companies for placements and the elected leaders should be able to address infrastructural issues,’’she said, adding that the present infrastructure in Pune was terrible . Another 19-year-old engineering student felt women’s safety is why she would vote and is hoping that the elected leaders address women’s issues. Election officials said there have been several drives and social media messages urging people to vote. Activist Indira Malkani, working in the field of motivating voters, said there was less time for election campaigns, not much visibility of candidates and rain was making it difficult. “However, we hope both young and old come out to vote in large numbers,’’she said. The reasons for eligible electors, especially those in the 18-28 age band, choosing not to vote need to be explored. “This is not unusual. Many political leaders are not able to strike a chord with the youth and their issues,’’ a political watcher said. “There is always talk about increasing the voter turnout.

Devendra Fadnavis makes good on election slogan | Mumbai News - Times of India,"Devendra Fadnavis, who took over the reins of the state five years ago, has not been known for taking shocking or sudden decisions. But he took the state by surprise on Friday when he made a comeback as Chief Minister for a second consecutive term. It was a secret 'Operation Maharashtra' with only a few bureaucrats attending the swearing-in. But they, too, were not aware of Fadnavis's swearing-in ceremony before they reached Raj Bhavan in the wee hours of Saturday. In the run-up to the assembly elections, Fadnavis had coined a slogan, 'Mi Punha Yein' (I will come back again), which had gone viral. In view of the massive success in the Lok Sabha elections, Fadnavis expected the saffron combine to secure at least 200-220 seats, with the BJP on its own bagging 160-170 seats. This way, even if the Shiv Sena did not agree to join his government, he could form the government under his own steam. The results of the assembly elections were shocking. The BJP won only 105 seats, while the Shiv Sena won 56 seats. Despite the fact that Shiv Sena declined to support him, Fadnavis did not lose hope. He quietly joined hands with NCP leader Ajit Pawar and staked claim to form the government. His election slogan has been fulfilled. Will cases against Ajit Pawar be closed? High-ranking IPS officers, who probed NCP leader Ajit Pawar for his dubious role in the irrigation scam and Maharashtra state cooperative bank scam, are facing a piquant situation following his induction into the state cabinet as deputy chief minister. In the run-up to the 2014 assembly elections, Devendra Fadnavis and Vinod Tawde had launched a state-wide campaign against the NCP, particularly Ajit Pawar for his alleged involvement in the Rs 70,000-crore irrigation scam. Fadnavis and Tawde had submitted several documents to water expert Madhav Chitale, who headed the expert committee. After Fadnavis took over as CM in December 2014, he had granted permission to the anti-corruption bureau to conduct an inquiry against Ajit Pawar, Chhagan Bhujbal and Sunil Tatkare. Offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code were registered against senior officials of the water resources department and contractors. Two months ago, an affidavit was filed by the ACB before the HC, outlining the role of the politicians in the scam. A senior IPS officer said the probe is now likely to be closed.

"Maharashtra elections: Pune citizens, resident groups try to boost voter turnout | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Citizens and resident associations across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have been taking multiple steps to spread awareness about voting in order to ensure a high voter turnout. From using social media to making home visits, the associations and citizens have left no stone unturned to make sure that people vote. Mahesh Limaye, the owner of Malhar Studio, said they created and released a WhatsApp video to encourage people to vote. “We made a video and are circulating it in order to spread awareness about voting, the ‘none of the above’ (NOTA) option and other aspects of the election. With reference to the passing score of 35 marks in examinations, we have tried to spread the message that the representative we elect must win by at least 35% votes and not lower than that,” he said. Pankaj Damle, the member of Sus Mhalunge Housing Societies Association (SMHSA), said they were using WhatsApp and other social media tools to spread awareness about voting. “We have requested individuals to use their voting power on Monday. We made posters, which are being circulated as well. We have also been visiting different societies in our area to hold meetings with residents to ask them to cast their vote,” he said. The members of Rotary Club of Walhekarwadi were assisting in distributing voter slips among residents. “Apart from appealing to people in our neighbourhoods, we are making sure the eligible voters get their voting slips. We have also planned to go from door-to-door on polling day to make sure people cast their votes,” a, member Ganesh Bora said. In continuation of their online voter registration campaign, the Wagholi Housing Societies Association had planned many steps to encourage voters. “A help desk will be set up at the Wagheshwar Temple to assist voters in finding their part number and electoral serial number. The volunteers from our Gram Suraksha Dal will assist the Lonikand Police at polling booths. Water will be served at the polling stations through the day,” Sanjeev Kumar Patil from the association said. He added that the association was installing interactive selfie points to motivate young and first-time voters. Warna Cooperative Bank, Rajaram Bapu Cooperative Bank and other cooperative banks have also led the way in encouraging their customers to cast their vote.

Youth leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who is on a whirlwind tour of Maharashtra and also campaigning for CPI candidates in the by-polls to Bihar made a pit-stop in Mumbra on Friday to canvass for NCPs Jitendra Awhad where he mesmerised collegians with his ""Azadi...""anthem. TOI speaks to the JNU scholar on a range of issues gripping the national political landscape. Are you campaigning for any one political party or a select mix of nominees across parties?I am lending my voice to people who are fighting against the BJP for certain principles. It is becoming very very challenging as to whom to support and where to go. I am canvassing for my party (CPI) candidates but there are few candidates from the opposition parties, like Jitendra Awhad, who are fundamentally firm on their secular ideologies irrespective of the party. Tomorrow, I am heading to Kishanganj in Bihar where I will speak out against the Congress MP who vacated his assembly seat but nominated his old mother there. We all have conceded when the sons and daughters take over the political legacy of their father. However, this is not acceptable. So I am going there to canvass for the CPI candidate. Its very evident that secular parties share very little in common and are fast disintegrating ?Yes, there is a lack of cohesion and this is because all the mainstream opposition parties have failed to embrace the emerging trends and the disillusionment in campuses across the nation. In fact, post 2014 all opposition parties went in hibernation. And the first breakthrough happened in 2015 in Maharashtra when students of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) resisted when they (BJP) tried to penetrate forcefully. Up till then the government had a free run changing the vice-chancellors, directors of IITs etc. They met their first resistance in FTII which subsequently spread all over to Ambedkar Periyar study circle, Hyderabad Central University JNU, TISS. Jadavpur University, Ferguson college etc. No doubt the opposition participated in the students movement but it failed to internalize the struggle and their presence was only for the sake of it. Would you agree that the mainstream political parties failed to capitalise on the campus agitations?The fact is, for the first time ever, the public sentiment was way ahead of the political parties. There was a serious disconnect between the mainstream secular parties and the movement building in the campuses. They failed to build their party program around these campus struggle. The mainstream political parties did not come under one platform untill the upsurge in JNU. It shows there is a disconnect and the mainstream political parties have their limitations. Secondly, they failed to give build an electoral narrative on issues like environment, gender, employment or farmers crisis. Will you or Jignesh Mevani be emerging as the magnet for secular forces?You see we are trying to build a political consensus. We have decided to identify individuals from different political parties, bring them together and forge a new political unity to fight fascist forces. Did you get any offers from.the mainstream parties to join them.Lots of them. But I choose to be with the CPI as integrity is of utmost importance to me. I have opted to be in politics to serve the people and not as a career move. Do you think Sharad Pawar could be the rallying point for opposition unity?Nobody can deny the fact that Sharad Pawar is a seasoned politician and in fact Modi himself has admitted publicly that he would take lessons from Pawar. He has certain political principles butbit would be very difficult to predict anything now. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Mumbai: Stupor of drug abuse, ills due to garbage dump bog locals here | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: In the dingy lanes of Bainganwadi at Shivaji Nagar in Mankhurd, people still talk about the recent murder of a teacher by her 13-year-old student. Even for an area no stranger to daylight stabbings, the murder came as a jolt. So much so that crime, security and the growing menace of drug addiction have suddenly become hot poll issues in the constituency where over 72% live in slums and barely have access to piped drinking water or clean air. “Boys as young as 8-10 are into drug abuse... Addiction is primarily responsible for rising crime rate and nobody is doing anything about it,” says Rabia Khan, a resident of Rafiq Nagar. Sensing the anger among locals, both sitting MLA Abu Azmi of Samajwadi Party and Shiv Sena contender Vitthal Lokare have made the fight against drugs their prime poll promise. Three-time Congress corporator Lokare, who recently defected to Sena, has promised to root out drug addiction within 100 days if elected. On his part, Azmi said he has brought it to the attention of the city police chief and chief minister. Azmi, a Colaba resident, has been the MLA her for 10 years. A time span, Lokare says, was enough to transform things in Mankhurd and Govandi where people live in fear of crime and suffer from life-threatening health hazards due to its proximity to Deonar dumping ground and the biomedical treatment plant. “At least 25,000 youths have fallen victim to drug abuse,” Lokare says, adding that Azmi has done nothing to improve conditions. A 2009 study on life-expectancy had shown that the average lifespan in Mankhurd was 39 years against 60-65 years in the rest of the city. “While we don’t know how much that has improved, we know that the area continues to be at the bottom of Mumbai’s Human Development Index,” said Dr Arun Kumar, CEO of NGO Apnalaya. A 2018 study by the NGO found that one toilet seat had a burden of 145 people as against the accepted ratio of 1:25. “Another 2017 study of 6,300 families had found that almost 68% were buying water from tankers daily,” he said, highlighting lack of basics. Dr Rahil Siddique who practises in the area says people suffer from recurrent bouts of lung, skin and stomach infection. “This area accounts for over 33% of the city’s multi-drug-resistant TB cases,” he said. Outside his clinic at Rafiq Nagar, Zulkais Khan says her son Ethesham (4) was born with diseased lungs. In the family, that has for years lived near the landfill, even adults suffer from breathing difficulty, fungal infection and diarrhoea. “Before every election, politicians promise us that the dumping ground will be shut. But garbage continues to come here. Sometimes water seeps into our homes and the fumes choke us,” says Khan. Azmi says, “I’ve asked scores of questions on the scientific closure of the dump. What else can an MLA do if the Sena-BJP government doesn’t give an alternative place?” He adds that the area now has concrete roads, direct water supply and cleaner classrooms thanks to him.

Terminating alliance with Shiv Sena would've hurt our credibility: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis | Mumbai News - Times of India,"Forty-nine-year-old Devendra Gangadhar Fadnavis has achieved the distinction of being only the second Maharashtra CM to complete a full term in office after V P Naik. In five years, he has neutralized his opponents within the BJP, taken on alliance partner Shiv Sena and worried the Congress-NCP by getting their key leaders to join BJP ahead of the assembly elections. Fadnavis is confident he is set to break all previous records and says the saffron combine will cross the mark of 220 seats. Fadnavis spoke on many subjects. Excerpts: What will be the outcome of the assembly elections? I have no doubt that the saffron combine will set a new record in the state's political history. People have made up their minds to vote for the development model proposed by PM Narendra Modi who has concentrated on growth and national security. The BJP-Sena alliance will sweep all regions. Ex-PM Manmohan Singh said the economic situation in Maharashtra is bad and investors are moving away from the state. Certainly Manmohan Singh is a well-known economist, but his statement on Maharashtra was a political one, made without understanding ground realities. Maharashtra's economy is the strongest compared to that of any other state in the country. During Congress-NCP rule, Maharashtra stood at No. 4 or 5 in terms of foreign direct and domestic investment. Now it leads in the country. Even in start-ups, Maharashtra has taken the lead. As per reports of the Government of India, particularly the National Sample Survey Organization, the most jobs have been created in the state. In the SME sector alone, 56 lakh jobs have been created in the last five years. Now we have drafted a roadmap for creating one crore jobs in the near future. In the days to come, our aim will to be create a drought-free state. In the past, we did take a series of measures, but we will have to intensify our efforts. What's your roadmap for the next five years? We have already invested Rs 1.4 lakh crore for the Metro network. We will complete all infrastructure projects in a time- bound manner and create more jobs in all sectors. Once the Metro network is complete, it will enhance quality of life, reduce congestion in the city and give a boost to the economy. Further, we are drafting an action plan for pushing the manufacturing sector. I think the good monsoon this year will help us create more jobs in the core sector. There are many rebels... It's a fact that a huge number of rebels from BJP and Sena are in the fray. It will certainly have an adverse impact, but it will be limited. I am sure the saffron combine will cross the 220 mark. What did you learn in the last five years? When I took over as CM, it was my first experience... In five years, I have become more mature. We face challenges daily. What I did was I tackled problems as priority and at the same concentrated on our daily agenda. I also felt that in a coalition government, we need better coordination and need to understand problems of a coalition government. On occasions, non-issues derail the development process. Why was there a delay in reaching a poll understanding with the Sena? There were two views - to contest together or separately. A section of leaders felt if we contested separately, BJP would still be able to form the government on its own, while the BJP leadership and I took the view that in the larger interest, we should contest jointly. Had we terminated the alliance, it would have affected our credibility. You denied nomination to leaders like Vinod Tawde... The state parliamentary board had recommended their names, but the BJP leadership refused nomination. They will be given new responsibilities. The Sena has asked for the deputy CM's post... It is possible. It will be considered during cabinet formation. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra polls: Devendra Fadnavis’ aggressive election pitch aims to put opposition on backfoot | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis is an early starter. Barely had the opposition in Maharashtra come to terms with the drubbing it had received in the Lok Sabha polls that the chief minister got into assembly campaign mode. The strategy was clear: When the opposition is down and out, don’t allow it to be up and about again. Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil’s formal switchover to the BJP after the LS polls, followed by that of other Congress-NCP leaders, was the first blow the CM delivered to the beleaguered ‘secular’ front, and early in August, he set out on a statewide Maha Janadesh yatra secure in the knowledge that if he launched the election campaign at that time, he’d have more than two months in which to criss-cross the state and reach out to as many voters as possible. The yatra began with an “I’ll be back as CM” war cry, meant more for the ears of the Shiv Sena—which wanted to anoint Aaditya Thackeray— than for the opponents, but the floods in many parts of Maharashtra brought it to a halt. The opposition accused Fadnavis of not halting it early enough and disregarding the miseries of the flood-hit. In response, he rattled off details of the relief work his administration was providing and meanwhile stitched up an alliance with Uddhav Thackeray so that saffron votes wouldn’t split. Then the yatra continued, culminating with both PM Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah praising him for doing excellent work as CM. If the ED’s spotlight on Sharad Pawar threatened to give the opposition a foot in the door, Modi and Shah also appeared to help Fadnavis slam it shut all over again by fiercely attacking the NCP and its alleged nexus with crime and terror. Pawar hasn’t given up of course and has matched Fadnavis in terms of the total number of rallies addressed, even after his confidant Praful Patel too came under the ED scanner, yet the CM has had the edge in terms of the number of areas covered across the state. One of the biggest advances for the BJP has been Fadnavis’s campaign for the party in Kankavli in the Konkan, a Sena bastion where hardly any BJP leader earlier would have openly made inroads for fear of upsetting its ally. This move showed that while his critics may have accused the CM of marginalizing his challengers within his own party, the truth all through this poll drive, which ended on Saturday, was that Fadnavis had got his friend Sena and political foe Pawar to spend more time on damage control than on expansion. Finally, he urged voters to help the saffron alliance create a “new Maharashtra.” Whether that claim on shaping the future is acceptable or not, the electorate will decide on Monday.

Mumbai seniors who have seen rise and fall of leaders over decades await polls on Monday | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: “I love plants and am very upset about what happened to Aarey forest,” says June Monteiro (97) leaning on her bed and surfing news channels on the television after her afternoon siesta. Her hearing may be a tad impaired but this nonagenarian’s brain is sharp, her eyesight clear and voice without a tremor as she rattles out more reasons—“GST, demonetisation, price rise”—that she claims are making her “anxious” about stepping out to cast her vote on Monday. “I’m worried about my legs. They’re not as sturdy as they used to be,” says the Pali Hill resident who has never failed to be at the polling booth since she moved to Mumbai from Hubli aged 19. June Monteiro, 97, a resident of Pali HillMumbai is home to many such senior citizens who have witnessed the rise and fall of leaders, the switch from ballot paper to electronic voting machines and it is their sense of responsibility and concern for a range of issues that will drive them to the polling booth on Monday. Recounting the change in his voter sentiments spanning five decades, Prahalad Samdani (76), a paediatrician from Malabar Hill, says, “I cast my first vote when I was 24. In those days, you went along with what your family believed and made a collective choice unlike now when each one has their own understanding of the party, the candidate, the manifesto and their past performance.” Hiro Hingorani, 95, Juhu residentNonagenarian Hiro Hingorani, an agricultural scientist with the ministry of agriculture and water resources, says, “Switchover from paper ballot to a voting machine is faster and easier. Being a scientist I believe doubts can be removed by verifying votes with VVPAT slips.” To make the task of voting easier for the silver aged, the Election Commission will set up senior citizen-friendly polling booths with wheelchairs, dolis (chairs strung between bamboo poles) and a separate queue. “We’ve also brought all the first-floor booths down to the ground level. There will be two volunteers and four labourers at every location to help those unable to climb even a few steps or the ramp to get to the booth,” says Farogh Mukadam, deputy district election officer for Mumbai city. Hingorani who came to Delhi from Karachi at 21 and has voted for every election, be it Lok Sabha, assembly or civic, since India's first in 1952 has been a recipient of kindness at the hands of poll officials. “As soon as volunteers see me, they take me ahead in the queue, so age shouldn’t be a bar to voting.” On the political landscape of today, he says, “Things keep changing. Nehru was my ideal in my youth. Today, Modi has mesmerised a huge chunk of the population. I have faith in the democratic system and don’t crib about things... That I’m 95 and talking to you over the phone is a huge mercy. I feel blessed that I am still able to have my say.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra elections: Dhananjay Munde faces FIR for 'remarks' against cousin | Mumbai News - Times of India,"BEED: An FIR has been filed against NCP leader Dhananjay Munde for allegedly making obscene comments against his estranged cousin and state minister Pankaja Munde of the BJP at a rally on October 17. With the video of Munde going viral on social media, a BJP functionary from Parli in Beed district filed a police complaint against him on Saturday, a police official said. Both the cousins are locked in a fierce battle in Parli. Pankaja, daughter of late BJP veteran Gopinath Munde, had defeated Dhananjay Munde in the 2014 assembly elections. On Sunday, Maharashtra State Commission for Woman (MSCW) also took suo motu cognisance of the alleged remarks made by Munde, the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council. MSCW chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar told reporters in Aurangabad that action will be taken against the NCP leader. Munde said the video clip, in which he was purportedly heard making the comments, was fake. He claimed that his remarks were ""distorted"" to project him as a ""villain"" by his rivals to win elections. PTI With the video of Munde going viral on social media, a BJP functionary from Parli in Beed district filed a police complaint against him on Saturday, a police official said. ""Acting on the complaint filed by Parli BJP president Jugal Kishor Lohiya, the FIR was lodged late Saturday night against Dhananjay Munde under Indian Penal Code Sections 500 (defamation), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult modesty of a woman) and 294 (obscene act in public place),"" Parli police station in-charge Purushottam Chobe told PTI. Lohiya in his complaint said the NCP leader allegedly made the obscene remarks against the BJP minister at a public meeting held at Vida village in Kej tehsil on October 17. The BJP has also complained to the Election Commission and the women's commission against the NCP leader's remarks. Some BJP workers also burnt his effigy at Shirur-Kasar tehsil here on Saturday night. MSCW chairperson Rahatkar said, ""We have not received any complaint but the remarks of Dhananjay Munde prime facie seem objectionable. We will enquire and take action against him."" However, Dhananjay Munde said the clip was being circulated on social media by ""distorting"" his comments to ""deliberately"" defame him and project him as a ""villain"". ""My speech at Vida has been tampered with. This is clearly an attempt (by rivals) to make me a villain and win the elections,"" he said at a press conference here on Sunday. ""I have succeeded in politics on my own. I sacrificed Parli constituency for Pankaja Munde (apparently referring to 2009 when Gopinath Munde fielded his daughter),"" he said. The NCP leader pointed out that he spoke at Vida last Thursday and the clip went viral on Saturday. ""The complainant has not submitted any CD of my speech and neither the police verified it. We also tried to complain over this controversy, but the police didn't entertain it. But my speech in Vida is tampered and people who recently entered the BJP have made this attempt,"" he alleged. ""I have not taken the name of my sister, I have never used words which will hamper the brother-sister relationship. This is an attempt to finish my political career. Our family has more number of female members...I will never make such comments which are below the dignity of women,"" he asserted. Earlier in a statement on Facebook late Saturday night, he demanded that the authenticity of the ""edited"" clip be tested in a forensic laboratory. Those who have ""edited"" the clip should at least respect the holy relationship of brother and sister, the leader of opposition in the state Legislative Council said. The NCP leader said he is contesting the election only on the issue of development, and asked his detractors not to stoop low by giving an emotional twist to it. ""It is an edited clip, distorts my statement and deliberately defames me. The clip is completely fake and its authenticity must be tested in forensic lab."" He alleged that an emotional twist was being given to the election in the constituency as he has been receiving huge response from the people, causing fear of defeat in the minds of his rivals. He also said he did not use bad words about any of his rivals, despite him being labelled as ""monster"". ""I did principle-based politics yesterday and doing it today. I have done 'kanyadaan' of my 1,500 sisters (girls). I will never use wrong words about any woman. Hence, workers and citizens should not believe in rumours,"" he added.

"Once ‘home to bar girls’, Mira-Bhayandar now does the election dance for its basic amenities | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: If a BR Chopra were to create a mega serial based on the epic Mahabharat today and choose to shoot it at Mira Road, he would not have to look beyond the Mira Bhayandar (145) constituency for a major character: Draupadi. For, ever since former mayor at Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation and BJP corporator Geeta Bharat Jain was denied a ticket to pave the path for sitting MLA Narendra Mehta, Jain has painted herself as the mythical “victim” Draupadi. “I question the silence of Bhishma Pitamahs in my party (senior BJP leaders) at the harassment of Draupadi,” said Jain at at her bungalow at Golden Nest Society in Mira Road. “My supporters are my Krishna, they’ ll do justice.” In Mira Bhayandar’striangular fight, Mehta is pitted against the rebel Jain and senior Congress leader, former MLC Muzaffar Hussain. The three main contenders plus Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Saleem Abbas Khan drum up their claims to corner votes. Here too, the BJP’s main plank is “nationalism”. Want evidence? The other day when dozens of train commuters alighted at Mira Road, defence minister and senior BJP leader Rajnath Singh at a meeting at Mira Road recounted his exhilarating experience of riding the Rafale fighter plane in France recently. “It flew with supersonic speed. If we had Rafale earlier, we would not have to go inside Pakistan to bomb Balakot. We could’ve done so sitting in India,” said Singh amid loud slogans of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Vande Matram’. Crowded trains, the tyranny of toll at Dahisar check post, garbage tax and corruption at civic and other government offices make living at Mira Bhayandar miserable. “Mehta promised he would make commuting by road tollfree but failed,” said Hussain. “Commuting by train is horrible and we will get new services started from Mira Road and ‘ladies special’ will be added from Bhayandar.” Hussain’s father Nazar Hussain had created “history” in the 1970s when he brought Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray and his bête-noire Indian Union Muslim League leader Ghulam Banatwala together for the foundation stone ceremony of Naya Nagar, the Muslim-dominated colony at Mira Road. Both Muzaffar and Jain accuse Mehta of “grabbing” plots reserved for gardens and schools. “If the plots are left vacant for years, slums could come up there. What’s wrong if some empty plots are developed as markets?” said Mehta. VBA candidate Saleem Abbas Khan who is being accused of “working” for Mehta to cut Congress’s Muslim and Dalit votes, said, “All three [Mehta, Muzaffar, Jain] live in palatial bungalows and are cut off from the masses,” he said from his tiny poll office, a stone’s throw from Mehta’s bungalow. “About 30,000 Dalit and OBC voters are backing me plus I will get a chunk of Muslim votes,” said Khan who switched sides from NCP to VBA. Advertising professional V C Kumar said life in Mira Road is better over the last decade. “Earlier, there was acute water scarcity and notoriety of housing bar girls. Water-logging was a major issue during rains. But now things have improved,” said Kumar. However, Kamal Minaee, poet and activist, said. “I was with Sena till a few months ago but quit it over its communal stand on triple talaq. Before that, I was with Congress briefly. I have friends everywhere, but I am nowhere. I may go out of town on voting day as I am disenchanted with every political party.” Unlike him others will stay back to choose their representative.

Maharashtra: Election campaign ends in fever pitch amid rain showers | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Canvassing for Monday’s state assembly election reached fever pitch before ending at 6pm on Saturday. Polling for the 288-member Maharashtra legislature will be held on Monday. By and large, the departing monsoon failed to rain down on the parade. Colourful flags and slogans rose in the air. Bike rallies were impacted though as riders tend to skid on newly wet roads. Fewer participants were able to join Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray’s bike rally in Worli. Earlier, the first Thackeray to enter the electoral battle campaigned in Dharavi for Ashish More and for mayor Vishwanath Mhadeshwar in Bandra (East) but sent a video message for Chandivli candidate Dilip Lande. Mhadeshwar said, “Aaditya came and we held a successful ‘Maha Rally’. It ended by 4.30pm and I got a good response.” In Thane, MNS chief Raj Thackeray once again stoked Marathi sentiment. “The Marathi-speaking community has been slowly pushed out from South Mumbai to Central Mumbai into the suburbs and it seems they will soon reach Uzbekistan,” he said. He was there to campaign for colleagues Avinash Jadhav, Mahesh Kadam and Sandeep Pachange. Thackeray questioned the Shiv Sena-BJP for soliciting votes on abrogation of Article 370 even as it neglected local issues like redevelopment of old buildings and job losses. His alien pitch continued in Nerul, Navi Mumbai, where he urged party cadre to become “more vigilant about migrants” and castigated the government for its “betrayal on toll waiver and the sorry condition of PMC Bank depositors”. Over at Shivaji Park, Mahim MNS candidate Sandeep Deshpande organised an early morning run where several regulars took part. His Sena opponent Sada Sarvankar held a roadshow. Wadala sitting MLA and BJP candidate Kalidas Kolamkar led a roadshow in Naigaum and Wadala. “The people of this constituency have known me and seen my work for 35 years. I have always interacted with them on a one-to-one basis,” said Kolamkar, a seven-time legislator. A Congress roadshow in Bhandup West was disrupted for over 45 minutes by rain showers and traffic. However, a heavy drizzle could scarcely dampen the spirits of Versova candidate and Sena rebel Rajul Patel, who has weathered a storm to fight as an independent contestant. “I led padyatras in Model Town and S V P Nagar as well as a chowk sabha in Suresh Nagar. My party workers said they were glad for the chance to soak in the rain, something they don’t commonly get to do,” she said with a laugh. Bandra BJP aspirant Ashish Shelar organised a motorcycle rally. He tweeted to say, “Even rain could not stop us! Huge final campaign bike rally with all Mahayuti padadhikari!” The motorcade led from Mahim causeway on to S V Road and Linking Road. Afterwards, Shelar met with groups of residents. His Congress rival Asif Zakaria thanked supporters. Former Congress MP Milind Deora joined a roadshow by four-time MLA Arif Naseem Khan in Chandivali. Deora also campaigned for Amin Patel (Mumbadevi) and Varsha Gaikwad (Dharavi). In Ghatkopar (West), BJP’s Ram Kadam, MNS’ Ganesh Chukkal and Sena rebel Sanjay Bhalerao rallied to reach voters. The constituency witnesses a triangular fight between sitting MLA Kadam, Congress’ first-time candidate Anand Shukla and Bhalerao. In Mulund, Congressman Charan Singh Sapra made a pitch to Mulund Colony where hundreds have fallen victim to the PMC Bank scam. The ruling BJP also visited the colonies hoping to appease depositors, and promising that the party will try to get them their money back. Three deaths and one suicide linked to the bank closure have angered PMC depositors who remain firm on their decision to boycott Monday’s election. As campaigning ended, the six assembly segments in Palghar district saw several street rallies. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Twenty-five Sena MLAs are in touch with CM Fadnavis and with me, and they will join the government led by Fadnavis if the Sena decides to sit in the opposition.” Maharashtra: NCP may join Shiv Sena-led govt with Congress's outside supportBlaming the Sena for delay in formation of government, Rana said, “The Sena is creating a hindrance in forming the government even though voters have given a clear mandate. This is an insult to the people of Maharashtra. About 20-25 Sena MLAs will sit on the BJP’s side within two months once Fadnavis takes over as CM.” Rana also advised Sena president Uddhav Thackeray to rein in Sanjay Raut. “Raut is the Sena’s parrot. Uddhav Thackeray himself should speak out as he was part of the meeting with BJP national president Amit Shah and CM Fadnavis and not Raut,” he said. The Sena has said that the BJP had agreed to share the CM’s post at this meet. Rana, along with his wife Navneet Kaur, who is MP from Amravati, met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari in the city on Monday to demand assistance for farmers who have lost their crops due to unseasonal rain.

Controversy in Latur over remarks by Congress leader Deepak Sood | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: Muslims took to the streets in Latur on Friday in protest against derogatory remarks made by Deepak Sood, the city’s former mayor, during a public meeting a couple of days back. Sood made the remark while referring to former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and his son Amit Deshmukh. He, however, offered unconditional apology soon after protests erupted. Community leaders, including Islamic scholars, went to the extent of demanding registration of police case against Sood on the charges of hurting religious sentiments. The issue put the Congress candidate in a spot as a sizeable number of Muslim voters in Latur have have been loyal to the Deshmukh family for decades. Sood stoked controversy on Tuesday night while addressing a mass gathering in the Old Renapur Naka area. He made the controversial statement in the presence of Amit Deshmukh and went on to promise the development of Latur while claiming that it has been hit following the death of Vilasrao Deshmukh. Surprisingly, none of the leaders present for the meeting realised the goof-up until Wednesday afternoon, when the video of the statement went viral on social media. The video soon resulted into a number of people from the minority community issuing statements online condemning the former mayor. Some used social media to express their anger while many even targeted Deshmukh for remaining silent on the issue. In his statement, Sood clarified that whatever he said during his speech was inadvertent and unintentional. “I did not intend to hurt the religious sentiments of the Muslim community. I offer my unconditional apology for the same.” The situation started returning to normalcy in Latur after the apology. In the meanwhile, the authorities concerned said that they were analysing the statement made by Sood, before taking a call on initiating further action.

Bharat Ratna for VD Savarkar: Congress now questions timing | Nagpur News - Times of India,"NAGPUR: Congress has changed its stand on BJP’s proposal for conferring Bharat Ratna on VD Savarkar, freedom fighter and right wing ideologue. Since Thursday, it is now slamming BJP for making it a poll issue in the state. On Wednesday, Congress national spokesperson Manish Tewari had said here that if BJP wanted to confer the award on Savarkar then why not on Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi. On Friday, another national spokesperson Sharmistha Mukherjee said that the party was not opposed to Savarkar per se but to BJP trying to reap electoral gains out of the proposal. “Why didn’t BJP confer the award in last five years? Why didn’t Atal Bihari Vajpayee do it when he was the prime minister? Why is this issue being raised now? Bharat Ratna is a state award. It is not something you promise in elections,” said Mukherjee. The change in Congress line was first made public by former PM Manmohan Singh. He had told the media in Mumbai on Thursday that the party was not opposed to Savarkar as Congress PM Indira Gandhi had issued a postage stamp commemorating him adding that the party was only opposed to his Hindutva ideology. After initial Congress attack on BJP over the proposal, Union minister Jitendra Singh tweeted a letter written by Indira Gandhi in 1980 in which she called Savarkar ‘remarkable son of India’. This caused problems for Congress leaders. On RSS, Mukherjee said that she was opposed to any organization that tried to divide the people of India. She also stood by her tweet criticizing her father Pranab Mukherjee for attending an RSS function. Earlier, Mukherjee slammed the BJP governments in the state and Centre for being apathetic towards problems of women. Reeling out government statistics, Mukherjee said that rapes had increased significantly under the rule of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “The number of rapes in the state was 1,546 in 2013, which increased to 2,305 in 2017. According to the economic survey, there were 4,076 rapes, which translates into 11 per day. What is the government doing,” she said. Mukherjee slammed PM Narendra Modi for making empty promises about women’s empowerment. “Rs928 crore was allocated under Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Mission, but only 19% of the amount has been spent and 40% of the expenditure was on publicity. Modi has not spent a single penny on several women’s empowerment schemes that he announced with much fanfare,” she said. The Congress leader also slammed Modi for not tabling the Women’s Reservation Bill in Lok Sabha even though her party was ready to support it.

Pimpri Chinchwad: NCP candidate Anna Bansode booked for code violation | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The Pimpri police on Thursday registered an offence against Anna Bansode, the NCP candidate from the Pimpri assembly segment and Jagannath Sable, former deputy mayor of the PCMC, for allegedly violating the ECI’s model code of conduct after they took out a ‘padyatra’ (march) in Pimpri on Thursday afternoon without permission. The police said Sable organized the ‘padyatra’ to campaign for Bansode from Link Road to Ramabainagar in Pimpri. “Sable had not obtained prior permission from the returning officer (RO) to organize the ‘padyatra’,” an officer from the Pimpri police said. The police had warned the organizers to take the RO’s permission. “We had even given the organizers a notice under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). They still organized the ‘padyatra’ and Bansode participated in it,” the officer said.

"For 15,000 at Air India in Kalina, this election is about their colony homes | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: For residents of Air India and Indian Airlines Colony in Kalina, the only relevant detail in any political party’s agenda for the assembly polls is the one about the fate of their residential quarters. With Air India en route to being privatized, the question is what happens to the quarters allocated by the national carrier to the 15,000-odd residents of these colonies. The airline occupies184 acres of land which formerly belonged to government-owned Airports Authority of India, but has now been handed over to GVK, which runs the Mumbai airport. “AAI used to pay a rent of Rs 14 crore a year to AAI, which was increased to Rs 24 crore in 2007 when GVK took over. AI has given a commitment to hand the land over to GVK in a phase-wise manner. In turn, GVK was to construct a multi-storey building to house these residents who currently live in colonies spread across 50 acres. But with Air India being privatized,it remains to be seen what happens to the agreement. The residents are rather apprehensive,which is why we are relieved to have an aviation insider contesting the elections,” said an AI official, a resident of the AI Colony. That is where the candidature of George Abraham, general secretary of Aviation Industry Employees Guild, comes in. Abraham, also a former corporator, is contesting on a Congress ticket. The battle for Kalina constituency, with 2.30 lakh voters, will largely be between Abraham and sitting MLA and Sena candidate Sanjay Potnis. Kalina has a sizeable minority population with almost 67,000 Muslim and 22,000 Christian voters. In the 2014 assembly poll, Potnis had won by a slim 1,300 margin.

"Maharashtra elections: Farmers are House lords, professionals way behind | Pune News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Data compiled by the state legislature secretariat on legislators elected in the last two and half decades shows that politics overwhelmingly remains the domain of the middle-aged and grey-haired, and the largest cohort of representatives quoted agriculture as their vocation. From 1995 to 2014, there were less than 10 legislators between 26 and 30 years, while the biggest group was between 51 and 55 (see box). In the last House too, there were only four from the young band and 60 in the older group. Political analyst Abhinandan Thorat and social worker Vishwambhar Choudhary, associated with the anti-corruption movement, expressed concern over the reluctance of the younger generation to join politics. “The younger generation is not interested in politics and social work, they are not keen on politics as career. Devendra Fadnavis and Nitin Gadkari are exceptions, honest people cannot make money in politics,” said Thorat. Choudhary highlighted another angle. He said the younger generation is reluctant to take up politics since most of the space has been occupied by the sons and daughters of leading politicians. “Once a person is elected for two to three consecutive terms, he/she is followed by his son or daughter. As a result, there is no scope for an outsider,” he said. The education standard of MLAs has been improving with the number of graduates and post-graduates outstripping those who have studied till Class X or XII. In 1995, 132 legislators were graduates; the number rose to 141 in 2014. Between 1995 and 2014, 28-40 postgraduates were elected. So far as the profession of elected representatives is concerned, between 1995 to 2014, on an average, 120 were agriculturists and 66 to 75 were in business and trade. In 2014, the legislature secretariat introduced a category for developers, and 13 legislators submitted that they were in the construction industry. In an encouraging sign, increasing numbers of professionals are plunging into politics. In the last 19 years, 10 to 20 MLAs were teachers, four to six were doctors, 16 to 20 were in the medical profession, and two to 10 were engineers. Legislature secretariat information and research officer B B Waghmare said it is a welcome trend. “I’ve been associated with the legislature secretariat for more than three decades, and have seen that Maharashtra has had some of the best and most talented legislators. I have seen leaders like Narayan Rane, Ajit Pawar, Devendra Fadnavis, Dilip Walse Patil spending hours in the library, studying speeches of veteran legislators. Now they secure the maximum information electronically,” said Waghmare. But political analyst Thorat said the people of Maharashtra are now missing well studied speeches of legislators in the assembly. “We are missing good debates on the floor of the House, issues are not being taken to their logical end,” he said. Activist Choudhury rued that mentoring eligible people for public life is shrinking with dynasty politics on the rise. Politicians like Sharad Pawar and Shankarrao Chavan were instrumental in bringing honest and efficient persons in politics. “Pawar introduced R R Patil, while Chavan was instrumental in introducing senior bureaucrat Raibhan Jadhav and Shrikant Jichkar in politics. That process has ended, politicians are concentrating on urban areas, and have less grassroots connect,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Lighter moment for a laughter club: Chatting with Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: A day before the election campaign ends for the October 21 assembly polls in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray, who is contesting from the Worli constituency, reached out to the locals there and shared some light moments with them on Friday morning at the Worli Sea Face. He promised them that he would ensure that Aarey is declared a ‘forest’. Aaditya is the first Thackeray to contest an election. He met voters who had come to Worli Sea Face for a morning walk. He then also visited members of the laughter club at the civic Gautam Buddha Garden at the Sea Face. Thackeray spent about an hour early in the morning at Worli. While walking at the Sea Face, Thackeray met senior citizens and addressed their grievances. Young voters were seen taking selfies with him. Many morning walkers pointed out and appealed to the Sena leader to save trees in the Aarey Milk Colony, many of which had been hacked to make way for the Metro III car shed.

"Muted poll campaign on northern limits of Mumbai, but triangular fight lends an edge | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Nothing, not even assembly election, can shake Dahisar out of its stupor. The idyllic suburb in Mumbai North prefers the choir music of the iconic IC Church and the ‘bhajans’ in the Vitthal temple to the throaty slogans of political parties, or so it seems. This explains the muted tone of the poll campaign here. There are nine candidates in the fray, but the fight is mainly between sitting BJP MLA Manisha Chaudhary, Arun Sawant of Congress Party, and Rajesh Yerunkar of MNS. The Dahisar seat belonged to Sena, but BJP wrested it when the two parties went solo for the 2014 polls. Chaudhary defeated Sena’s Vinod Ghosalkar by nearly 38,000 votes. However, this time around, the BJP-Sena has inked a poll pact, and in keeping with the seat-sharing formula, Dahisar has been retained by BJP. Chaudhary is seeking a mandate on the strength of her work: providing gas connections to 4,500 families under the Centre’s Ujjwala scheme, redevelopment of slums in Shanti Nagar and Ambawadi, cleansing of Dahisar river and construction of over 400 public toilets blocks. A Rs 48-crore mangrove park is in the pipeline, she adds. Yet, perennial problems like potholes, lack of water supply and flooding persist. Also Ganpat Patil Nagar, described by many as Mumbai’s second Dharavi, minus its enterprise, has become a cause for concern for the tranquil IC Colony. “Large mangroves were axed for illegal hutments where migrants live in sub-human condition,” says Cyril D’Souza, a local resident, says: “Ganpat Patil Nagar has become a haven for drug peddlers and anti-social elements.” Yadnyesh Zagade, an entrepreneur, demands urgent measures to strengthen the infrastruture at Dahisar station. “To book long-distance train tickets, we have to trek to Borivli,” says Zagade. The Congress candidate feels the deepening financial crisis may go against BJP. “... many slums in Dahisar have no toilet facilities for women,” says Sawant, a management graduate who has been running health campaigns in Dahisar for over a decade. Yerunkar accuses Chaudhary of doing a vanishing act after getting elected in 2014. “ She lacks vision, and has no blueprint for the planned development of Dahisar which is bursting at the seams,” says the MNS candidate. Yerunkar, a banker by profession, says if elected, he would tackle issues like flooding, bad roads and curb the illegal goings-on in Ganpat Patil Nagar. Chaudhary hopes to tap support from the Bhandari-Wadval-Agari community and slum dwellers, but locals feel anti-incumbency will weaken her chances of retaining the seat. “Economy is in a bad shape and people are aware of it,” says Zagade.

Maharashtra elections: Will rebels from saffron camp play spoiler and boost opposition tally? | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Though the BJP-Sena alliance is confident of winning over 220 seats of the total 288 in the assembly polls, rebellion in both parties is a cause of concern with nearly 55 rejected aspirants from their camp contesting as independents. The rebels have stood their ground notwithstanding efforts by the leadership of both parties to get them to withdraw their nominations. According to political analysts, some of these rebels are strong enough to not only cause enough division of votes to cost the BJP-Sena’s official candidates their seats but also to ensure wins for candidates from the opposition. At least 15-20 seats of the saffron combine could be under threat owing to the rebels, the analysts said. With tensions in the BJP-Sena alliance, aspirants in both parties were ready to contest a majority of seats in the state if the alliance did not come through. While that led to disappointment for many hopefuls, many others were upset because someone else was chosen from the party for the seat they were eyeing. Plus, influx of leaders from the Congress and NCP meant that several of them had to be accommodated as well at the cost of party members. There were initially over 100 rebels from the Sena-BJP camp in the fray when the nominations were filed, but after CM Devendra Fadnavis and Thackeray intervened, the number came down to almost half of that. A total of 1,500 candidates, including those from various parties and independents, withdrew their nominations eventually. Candidates from both the Sena and BJP are in the fray in two constituencies: Kalyan East and Kalyan West. Ganpat Gaikwad is the BJP’s official candidate in Kalyan West, while four-time corporator and Sena rebel Dhananjay Bodare is contesting as an independent and may eat into Gaikwad’s votes as the Sena’s traditional voters may vote for the rebel. Five Sena corporators have resigned and extended support to Bodare. In Kalyan East, a seat which is with the Sena, which has fielded Vishwanath Bhoir, sitting BJP MLA Narendra Pawar has rebelled. Pawar, who is contesting as an independent, is considered a strong rebel. In western Maharashtra, upset with his party decision, BJP’s Ravindra Arali has filed nomination as an independent against the party’s official candidate Vilas Jagtap in the Jat constituency of Sangli district. BJP’s Rajan Teli has also revolted against Sena candidate Deepak Kesarkar in Sawantwadi constituency in the Konkan. Kesarkar is a minister of state for home and finance. Mumbai has four prominent rebels: BJP’s Murji Patel from Andheri East, Sena rebel Rajul Patel from Versova, Sanjay Bhalerao from Ghatkopar (W) and Trupti Sawant from Bandra East. Pramod Olekar, a political observer and assistant professor at Ashta College in Sangli said the saffron alliance’s prospects could be affected in 15-20 seats due to the rebellion. He also said chances of independents winning were greater this time because in many places, BJP-Sena or Congress-NCP hopefuls who have been denied tickets were strong.

"BJP taking Kothrud voters for granted, says MNS chief Raj Thackeray | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray on Friday said the BJP was taking voters for granted by fielding Kolhapur’s Chandrakant Patil from Kothrud. The BJP is imposing the candidate assuming that people will blindly vote for anybody the party picks, he said at an election rally in Kothrud. MNS candidate Kishor Shinde is fighting against BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil in the assembly election. ""Patil has done all his work in Kolhapur so why is he afraid of contesting from Kolhapur?"" he said. The elections are being fought on non-issues like caste, creed and religion. The real issues like job loss and the economic slowdown in the country are not being highlighted. “Casteism is prevailing in the election which should be conducted on the basis of the candidate and his work, one who would rush to solve the problems faced by citizens at any given time should be elected,"" he said. Referring to former prime minister Manmohan Singh's analysis of the country's economy, Thackeray said the slowdown in the country has just begun. The situation is going to worsen and Maharashtra is going to suffer the most, he added. The state pays the highest tax in the country, but gets nothing in return, he said. Yet, no elected representative from the ruling party has raised the issue. A strong opposition is needed, he said.  Thackeray’s first rally scheduled at a school’s ground on Bajirao Road could not be held. Heavy rain at the start of the rally led to severe waterlogging. He has targeted the Centre for harping on Article 370 when the country is passing through a grave financial crisis.

BJP rebel has opposition backing to play spoilsport: Shiv Sena chief Udhav Thackeray | Navi Mumbai News - Times of India,"NAVI MUMBAI: Addressing a rally at Uran on Saturday, Shiv Sena chief Udhav Thackeray reminded the audience that BJP would not have come to power in 2014 without Sena backing, after the two parties fought the polls separately. BJP rebel, Mahesh Baladi is challenging Sena sitting MLA Manohar Bhoir for the Uran seat, with support from the opposition, said Thackeray. Backstabbing is not the ideology of Bal Thackeray's Shiv Sena, he said. The BJP rebel candidate has been campaigning with photographs of PM Modi and CM Fadnavis on his vehicles, he said, adding that this was not an alliance model that they wanted. The Sena nominee deserves to be the official candidate of the alliance in Uran, as he is the sitting MLA and he was nominated in accordance with the seat-sharing agreemement, Thackeray said.

Debutant Aaditya Thackeray likely to get cabinet berth | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena is likely to elect its legislative party leader on Thursday after the BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis and NCP’s Ajit Pawar were elected unanimously as leaders by their respective parties. The Sena has called a meeting of its 56 newly-elected MLAs on Thursday at Sena Bhavan in Dadar to decide who will lead the party in the assembly. The meeting, which will also be attended by six Independents who have declared their support to the party, would be chaired by Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya. Party sources said that Eknath Shinde and Subhash Desai, who were both ministers in the Fadnavis government between 2014 and 2019, would be the frontrunners for the post of legislative party leader as well as the deputy chief minister's post offered by the BJP, if the Sena decides to accept it. Sources said Aaditya, the first from the Thackeray family to have been elected as an MLA (from Worli), may not accept the responsibility of party leader in the state legislature due to lack of experience in floor management and may prefer to work for a while under Shinde or Desai. However, Aaditya is likely to be inducted in the state cabinet so that he can learn the ropes before he takes over as the Sena leader in the house, sources said. Being a minister, Aaditya Thackeray would be able to attend both the upper and lower houses; if he is just an MLA, he would not be able to enter the upper house. While Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said in an informal talk with mediapersons that he would do ""whatever possible"" including pursuing the ""50-50"" formula on sharing of power, he is likely to announce the party's stand on issues related to power-sharing at the party meet on Thursday. A party functionary said that the Shiv Sena would insist on getting at least two key portfolios of the four that the BJP is in no mood to part with: home, revenue, finance and urban development. ""The Shiv Sena may insist on getting revenue and urban development,"" the functionary said. The party wants to get at least 9-10 cabinet berths, sources said. In 2014, the Sena has 5 cabinet rank posts while 7 Sena legislators were junior ministers. On Tuesday, BJP MP Sanjay Kakade had said that 45 MLAs of the Sena were in touch with the BJP and wanted to join a government led by Fadnavis. Another point of speculation on Wednesday was whether 23 Sena MLAs were in touch with the BJP and would help the BJP to form the state government if the Sena did not agree to join. Asked about this, Sena MP and Saamna executive editor Sanjay Raut said, ""They might have forgotten the name of Aaditya Thackeray and our prominent leaders in the list of 23 MLAs. From where has the number 23 come? They should have announced the names of all 56 legislators."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
‘Narendra Modi government cannot tackle slowdown’ | Pune News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma on Friday accused the Narendra Modi government of lacking policy, vision and commitment to revive the economy, and claimed BJP was running away from giving a report of its work to the public. At a press conference here, Sharma said Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis were targeting and maligning Opposition leaders to deflect questions about their own performances. “Why are issues of farmer suicide, unemployment and the economic crisis not being discussed in the election campaign,” he asked. Investment, industrial production and exports were down while the Modi dispensation continued to harp on making India a $5 trillion economy, he said. “To achieve the target, we need double digit growth, while it is 5% or less now,” Sharma said. He said the government had taken Rs 1.7 lakh crore from Reserve Bank of India’s contingency reserve and slashed corporate tax, but till September 15, the Rs 7 lakh crore revenue target had not been met. “How does the government plan to meet the target (for the full year) in the next six months,” he asked.

Maharashtra elections: Clamour for cap on candidates’ expenses | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: A political party should limit its spending on a candidate contesting the elections to not more than 50% or half of the candidate’s expenditure limit, said poll observers. The poll expenses of political parties reached Rs60-70crore in the recent Lok Sabha elections as per the assessment of poll expenditure. The ECI had proposed a cap, but it is yet to be cleared by the government. The EC had proposed that expenditure by parties during the elections “should be either 50% of, or not more than the expenditure ceiling limit provided for the candidate” and changes have to be made to the Representation of the People’s Act and rule 90 of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961. If the rules come into place, a political party may not be able to spend more than Rs25-35lakh per candidate in the Lok Sabha elections and not more than Rs10-14lakh per candidate in assembly elections. A recent report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and Maharashtra Election Watch (MEW), after assessing expenditure statements of 285 of the 288 sitting MLAs from 2014, showed that 119 ML As had declared individual election expenses of less than 50% of the expense limit in their constituency. While the average election expenses by them was Rs 15-16 lakh, comprising around 54 per cent of their expense limit. “While this may look good on paper, there are many candidates from national parties who might not have revealed the actual expenditure,’’ stated a poll observer. The expenditure limit is Rs28lakh per candidate andthe expenses mainly relate to public meetings, processions, electronic and print media campaigns, vehicles used and campaign materials. There is a new additional list which includes drones, mobile vans and even bullock carts used for election purposes. While the EC has been unable to cap a political party’s expenditure in an election, it has put expenditure limit on candidates -- Rs 50-70 lakh for each Lok Sabha candidate and Rs 20-28 lakh for an assembly candidate.

Maharashtra elections: Savvy candidates wage hashtag war at the hustings | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: If it’s the age of social media, the hashtag is surely the king. Election candidates and their war rooms are showing both creative drive as well as discipline in courting the king to connect with voters. From #AwaamkiAawaaz to #HeretoServe to #Mihir4Mulund, netas are ensuring they make their presence felt and tell each and every voter they are in the race. Once the hashtags have been created, supporters of the netas ensure that they tweet using it so that it reaches a larger audience. Taking the case of sitting Congress MLA from Mumbadevi, Amin Patel. Every tweet he posts — whether it’s about his election rally or his plans for the next five year if he gets elected — has #AwaamKiAawaz #AminPatelHaiNa. Awaam is the Urdu word for common people or general public and considering a sizeable Muslim population that the ward boasts of, Patel feels it helps connect with them faster. “There are almost 2.4 lakh voters in my assembly constituency and at times it is not possible to reach out to each and every person. Therefore, I feel what is better than using social media,” says Patel. In Bandra West, sitting MLA Ashish Shelar, among legislators with the largest followers on Twitter, regularly uses the hashtags #Vandre-WestVidhanSabha and #mahajanadesh. His supporters tweet using hashtags like #SahiKoshishSahiAshish. His opponent, Congress’ Asif Zakeria, who has actively taken to Twitter, is using #alwaysthereforyou. Zakeria said the hashtag is synonymous with him, considering he has been there for his voters as a corporator. Andheri West sitting MLA Ameet Satam, who uses #CelebrateAndheri, said he chose it to celebrate the work he has done in the last five years. “The hashtag resonates with the large development works I have initiated, whether it is Juhu beach illumination, open space development or zero waste projects,” says Satam. Another catchy hashtag (#Mihir4Mulund) in circulation is by BJP contender from Mulund, Mihir Kotecha. The branding achieved through the hashtags is extended by using them in election campaign materials like handbills or brochures describing the work candidates have done. Samajwadi Party corporator Rais Shaikh, who is contesting the assembly elections from Bhiwandi East, has been using #RisewithRais. “The hashtag was used in my election campaign material right from the time I contested the corporation elections in 2017 for my second term. While my social media team does the creative, all posts are put up only after my approval,” he said. Shiv Sena’s Yamini Jadhav, who is contesting from Byculla, uses #HereToServe while posting videos, photographs. It is a reference to the fact that former corporator Jadhav’s husband is now the corporator. Many netas said with social media, there is no barrier between them and their voters. “The comments are both positive and sometimes negative, but it surely helps in understanding the genuine pulse of the voters active on social media,” said Patel.

"Cane bills, scarcity take a back seat in Solapur | Kolhapur News - Times of India","KOLHAPUR: Non-payment of sugar cane bills and drought are not on the campaign talk in the assembly election in Solapur district. Most focus has been around the shifting political equations and electioneering. The district, which is considered a part of the sugar bowl of the state, has around 45 private and cooperative sugar mills. However, most of them are in poor financial condition. Eight of the ten rural assembly segments in the district are perennially drought-prone. Despite having water scarcity, each constituency has an average of three sugar mills, which are controlled by politically influential leaders. Sources in sugar industry fear that many sugar factories may not be in position to start crushing season this year because of the drought. However, this major issue is missing from the poll campaign though several sugar barons are in the election fray. The agrarian crisis has been limited to the criticism from the BJP and Shiv Sena, accusing the past governments of neglecting the water supply to the parched regions of the district. The NCP-Congress has revolved its campaign around dubbing the Fadnavis government as “anti-farmer”. However, voters seem to be more influenced by local political equations. Solapur district witnessed large-scale import and export of the leaders in the past few months. Congress and NCP took the worst hit of defections. Such was the situation that the two parties struggled to find strong candidates in some constituencies. In two constituencies, NCP withdrew their candidates after officially announcing their names. Seven constituencies, namely Pandharpur, Barshi, Karmala, Mohol, Malshiras, Sangola, Solapur south, are experiencing traditional rivalry among the political leaders, who have changed their loyalties. The most prestigious seat for Congress is Solapur city central where Praniti Shinde, daughter of former chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde, is attempting for third consecutive time. Sushilkumar has lost the last two Lok Sabha elections and this assembly election will decide his daughter’s future. Recently, Sushilkumar said the Congress and NCP are “tired” and need to be merged. Solaur district is witnessing young candidates like Aniket Deshmukh of PWP in Sangola and veterans like Sudhakar Paricharak and Narsayya Aadam. Barring a few exceptions, all political parties have fielded candidates having agrarian background but farming does not figure in the campaign.

Maharashtra elections: In-house celebrities catch fancy of political parties | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: “ Tarikh par tarikh, tarikh par tarikh, tarikh par tarikh, yaad rakhiye ekish tarikh apko vote dena hai, BJP ko jitane hai,” said BJP MP and actor Sunny Deol in his rakish voice, borrowing a line from his 1993 hit film Damini. Sporting a Punedi pagdi, Deol placed his arm around Yogesh Tilekar, the BJP candidate for the Hadapsar seat, for whom he has come to canvass. As Tilekar broke into a smile, the motley group of starry-eyed onlookers squealed in delight. “Deol is a crowd-puller and has participated in roadshows,” said BJP spokesperson Ujjwal Keskar. “When actors like him come, it creates a different kind of atmosphere. People, who normally do not attend political rallies, come to see the film stars,” he said. In Aurangabad, actor-producer Riteish Deshmukh has been campaigning, along with his actor wife Genelia D’Souza, for his brothers — Congress nominees Amit and Dhiraj, who are contesting from seats in Latur district. In Pune and elsewhere, veteran actor Shatrughan Sinha has been roped in by the party to campaign for its nominees. Known for his famous dialogue ‘ Khamosh!’, Sinha is anything but silent in real life. “He speaks well on certain issues. He joined the BJP and then left it to join the Congress. This is a signal we want to give to voters,” said Anant Gadgil, the Congress spokesperson. Others, too, are banking on star power to win election. Shiv Sena has fielded Marathi actress Deepali Bhosale from Kalwa-Mumbra assembly segment against MLA Jitendra Awhad. NCP MP Amol Kolhe, famous for essaying the role of Shivaji Maharaj in Marathi TV shows, is now one of the star campaigners of his party. “Stars are natural crowd pullers but instead of bringing in just about anybody, political parties are increasingly relying on celebrities associated with them. This provides a certain level of comfort, besides saving the party from the embarrassment of seeing the celebrities lend their star appeal to another party,” Gadgil said. However, NCP Rajya Sabha MP Vandana Chavan pointed out that the number of film stars has diminished on the poll firmament over the years. “Most actors are now scared to voice their opinion for the fear of being trolled online,” she said.

Amit Shah targets Congress leaders over VD Savarkar and Kashmir | Nagpur News - Times of India,"NAGPUR: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday jumped into the war of words between BJP and Congress over the proposal to confer Bharat Ratna on VD Savarkar, freedom fighter and Hindutva ideologue. Addressing a public meeting in Khaparkheda while campaigning for Tekchand Sawarkar (Kamptee) and Raju Potdar (Saoner), Shah wondered what had happened to present generation of Congress leaders. “Your ancestors never said a word against Savarkar. Tell me one freedom fighter who was awarded two life sentences by the British? Tell me one family where two brothers were awarded life sentences for fighting against British? Savarkar’s entire property was confiscated by the British. He was with his brother in Kalapani for 10 years but they could not see each other’s face. And Congress leaders are insulting such a person. Don’t they have any shame?” he said. Without naming NCP leader Praful Patel, Shah slammed him for his alleged links with Dawood Ibrahim’s aide Iqbal Mirchi. “How can he sign a commercial agreement with a person who was involved in Mumbai bomb blasts in which 350 people were killed? You were a minister in UPA government at that time. Don’t you have any shame?” he said. The BJP leader wondered whether there was any link between former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Pakistan. “Rahul repeats what Pakistan says and vice versa. Rahul said that human rights situation in Kashmir was not right. Pakistan raised the issue in United Nations (UN) quoting him,” he said. Shah further said that BJP government had set up several top educational institutions in the city whereas Congress had done nothing in this regard. He further said that Samruddhi Corridor would bring prosperity to Vidarbha. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

We will be an effective opposition: Maharashtra Congress chief | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Both Congress and NCP on Friday made it clear that there is no proposal before them to support Shiv Sena in the event it decides to stake claim for forming government in Maharashtra. State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat said he has seen reports in a section of the media on the possibility of Sena forming government with the help of Congress and NCP, but there is no substance in such reports, since there is no such nproposal on his table. “Our performance in the assembly was quite satisfactory, though we were not able to dislodge the BJP-led government. We are happy we were able to enhance our strength in the legislative assembly. Now, we will play the role of an effective opposition and work from the grassroots up for the revival of the organisation at all levels,” Thorat said. If one looks at the outcome of the assembly election, the Maharashtra Congress chief said, it has been established that BJP has paid a heavy price for arrogance and the misuse of central investigating agencies. “BJP used money and muscle power to lure Congress-NCP leaders into its fold. Significantly, many of the defectors were defeated by huge margins. A clear message has been given to the government: do not take people for granted,” Thorat said. He said the Congress-NCP front, “along with like-minded parties, secured 117 seats”. “We halted the forward march of the saffron combine. The opposition has become more powerful than ever before. The way NCP president Sharad Pawar took the state by storm, I must place it on record. Pawar’s campaigning helped the Congress-NCP front in its performance.” Mumbai NCP president Nawab Malik, who won back the Anushakti Nagar constituency from Shiv Sena, said that all along Fadnavis claimed that the opposition would be wiped out. “He has been proved wrong. It’s time for the chief minister for self-introspection. The ruling combine’s margin has been reduced drastically. The opposition lost several seats by a narrow margin. Devendra Fadnavis claimed that the saffron combine would win 220 seats, but it has won just over 160. Its performance has been dismal,” Malik said. “The people of Maharashtra have shown BJP and Sena their place.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra assembly elections: Catchy songs, customized lyrics woo voters | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Riding the popularity of Bollywood movie Gully Boy, former member of Parliament from Kolhapur, Dhananjay Mahadik, had commissioned a special rap song to woo voters during the Lok Sabha elections in May. Candidates contesting the state assembly election on October 21 have opted for tunes of popular Bollywood and Marathi films to grab the attention of voters in their constituencies. Autorickshaws mounted with multiple speakers are plying across the city, campaigning for various candidates using a mix of music and speeches. Candidates across party lines have opted for this traditional campaign to have the maximum reach before campaigning ends. Mahesh Limaye, owner of Malhar Studio, said, “Candidates have opted for tunes of popular songs combined with special lyrics. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate for Khadakwasla, Bhimrao Tapkir got two songs recorded. One song has the background score of popular Marathi song ‘Mauli Mauli’ while the lyrics include details about all the work he has done for the constituency,” he said. “Many Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidates have added inputs from chief minister’s Mahajanadesh Yatra as well,” he added. The demand has been lower than the previous elections. “There hasn’t been much of a demand for audio recordings for this election. We have done recordings for nearly 20 candidates across the state but the number is small. We have had more demands for creation of video clips for WhatsApp, including campaign clips and general awareness ones,” Limaye added. Voice-over artist Anvay Bendre said candidates are focusing on rallies and personal connect while using recorded material only to supplement the rallies. After recording for 17 candidates across the state, Bendre said, “Some people register information better when they hear. This is when the audio becomes integral. It includes crisp clips with songs and recorded speech. The content I have recorded this year for most candidates focuses on development.” On the use of sound score of popular songs, Bendre said familiarity with the original song attracts people. “People relate to tunes of songs. Familiar tunes attract people who also listen to the lyrics which ensured that the message reaches voters,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Ditch tiger and lotus, hitch a ride on auto: Saffron rebels tell voters | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Two corporators belonging to BJP and Shiv Sena are contesting the assembly polls in separate constituencies in Andheri as independents with the autorickshaw as their election symbol. Incidentally, both belong to the Patel community. The candidates are Rajul Patel, who has the reputation of a hardcore Shiv Sainik, and BJP’s Murji Patel, who is facing corporation disqualification proceedings over a caste certificate. Both hope their party sympathisers would come out in support of them on polling day, and not their parties’ official candidates. Both have embarked on bizarre election campaigns, with the common message that they are ‘unofficial’ representatives of their respective saffron parties and that they completely identify with their parties’ programmes. They are even using some of their parties’ resources: Sena and BJP workers at the local level are working with the respective Patels, but have ensured that no senior party leader’s pictures are spotted in the independents’ campaigns. The catch? They say it’s a small matter that they are fighting as independents, and their autorickshaw symbol ought to have the same cache with voters as the tiger or the lotus.

Maharashtra election 2019: Rebels spark trouble in saffron camp | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Matoshree maintained a stoic silence on why the BJP had turned down Sena's 50-50 formula for an equal share in power and executive responsibilities. Sena president Uddhav Thackeray was home-bound, meeting colleagues and welcoming new entrants into the party. Speaking informally to mediapersons at Matoshree, Uddhav said, referring to son   Aaditya's candidature from Worli   , that the new generation should join politics and make a constructive contribution to society. He said he had not thrust Aaditya on the party or party workers. The BJP seemed hardly in a mood to pat itself on the back for gifting itself more assembly seats than the Sena or for cutting some of its own ministers and MLAs to size as reports of rebellion began to pour in at the Maharashtra BJP's Backbay reclamation headquarters. The BJP's decision to field Chandrakant Patil from Kothrud in Pune has not gone down well with Medha Kulkarni, the sitting MLA, and her followers. Kulkarni has conveyed her ire to party bosses, coupled with a veiled threat that NCP leaders were willing to offer her the party candidature from her stronghold, it is learnt. Maharashtra Assembly polls: BJP and Sena seal 162-126 seat dealPatil's candidature could become a delicate affair for the BJP as he ranks No. 2 in the state cabinet and also heads the party's Maharashtra unit. BJP MLA from Nagpur Sudhakar Kohale too is in a belligerent mood as he has been denied party nomination. Tension brews in the Raigad unit of the BJP too, as party workers wanted four of the seven assembly seats in the district. The Sena has bagged five seats there, leaving two for the BJP. Senior BJP activist Mahesh Baldi on Monday filed his nomination papers from Uran against Sena's Manohar Bhoir. More BJP workers are planning to turn rebels.

However, the party seems to be not in favour of retaining him for now. While Nitesh Rane is likely to get a nod from the BJP, the Sena is peeved with its ally's ""soft spot"" for the Rane family, said a Sena functionary. Matoshree thinks Rane and his son will strain every nerve, at the BJP's behest, to cut the Sena to size in the Konkan, he said. The Sena is yet to decide its candidate from Bandra (East). Matoshree is said to be keen on replacing Trupti Sawant, the sitting MLA, with Mumbai mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar. Sawant finds herself in a spot as a section of local Sainiks are opposed to her candidature, saying that she hardly bonded with local residents during her tenure as MLA. The Bhandup assembly seat too hangs in a limbo as the Sena isi yet to make up its mind on whether to renominate sitting MLA Ashok Patil or back Ramesh Korgaonkar's candidature.

Maharashtra assembly election: VBA spoiler for Congress-NCP in three seats | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Though the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) did not win a single seat in Pune in the assembly elections, it scuttled the prospects of Congress-NCP in three seats where VBA candidates polled more votes than the winning margins. The seats are Pune Cantonment, Shivajinagar and Khadakwasla, which witnessed close fights and narrow winning margins. In Pune Cantonment and Shivajinagar segments, Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) candidates won by 5,000 votes.  In both the seats, the VBA nominees got over 10,000 votes. In Khadakwasla, the winning margin of Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Bhimrao Tapkir was 2,595, while VBA candidate secured 5,951 votes. Sources in the city’s political circles said that the division of votes between Congress-NCP and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi indirectly helped BJP to clinch victories in these three segments. Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi candidates secured third positions in some constituencies, but the outfit failed to win. A NCP leader said that VBA and NCP-Congress should have joined hands as their ideologies are similar. “Joining hands with VBA would have helped in keeping the saffron combine at bay.

"Maharashtra assembly polls: Of nearly 3,300 candidates in the fray this time, less than 10% are women | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Women represent just 7% of the current Vidhan Sabha strength in the state. Of the 288 seats in the Maharashtra assembly, only 20 are occupied by women. In the upcoming elections, too, around 200 women candidates are contesting the election, either on party tickets or as independents, out of the approximately 3,000 candidates in the fray for the October 21 polls. Women politicians pointed out that while the gender ratio in voter registration has improved, parties still shy away from fielding women candidates. They said that political parties should give more opportunities to women. Only if there is 50 per cent reservation for women in elections, as is done in panchayats, will the women be adequately represented, they said. Poll analyst Chandrakant Bhujbal told TOI that only 235 women candidates are in the fray out of the total 3,237 candidates in the 2019 assembly elections. Among them, 3,001 are male candidates, while Chinchwad assembly constituency has a transgender candidate. ‘When there is pressure for equal representation of women and men in every field, why should it not be applicable in politics,’’ asked Bhujbal. Even the 33 per cent reservation for women in general elections is pending and no party is willing to take up or implement it, he pointed out. Women candidates in the fray said that it is injustice on the part of the party and even the government not to have equal representation. ‘While the participation of female voters is encouraged, why there is less than 10% representation of women candidates in the elections,” asked a women candidate from a party. Pune’s Gokhale Institute of Economics and Politics had come out with a study which said that most women contest polls only because there is reservation and not because they are given a chance to contest polls. Altogether 668 women contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as against 45 in 1957. However, 65 women entered the Lok Sabha in 2014 as against 22 in 1957, according to the Election Commission figures. The success rate of women Lok Sabha candidates has declined from nearly 50 per cent in 1957 to nearly 12 per cent in 2014.

Overall turnout falls in 10 big fight seats of rural Pune | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The 10 assembly constituencies in rural Pune recorded an overall voting of 66% on the polling day for the State Assembly Elections 2019 on Monday. The voting percentage in the rural belt fell by about 5% this year from 71.98% voting percentage in 2014 assembly election. “Some areas of the district had received short spells of rain in the morning which impacted the voting turnout. But the voting percentage was impressive in Indapur, Baramati, Maval, Ambegaon, Junnar and Khed which is a positive sign for us,” the district collector Naval Kishore Ram told TOI. Indapur recorded the highest with 75.44% among the 10 rural constituencies in Pune district and Purandar, the lowest 65.91% voting. The outcome in Indapur has generated interest in view of former minister Harshvardhan Patil quitting the Congress to join the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in September, barely a month before the polls. Indapur had recorded 78.77% and 76.76% voters’ turnout in the 2014 and 2009 assembly elections, respectively. Patil is pitted against traditional rival and NCP’s sitting MLA Datta Bharane, who had defeated him in the 2014 elections when the Congress and the NCP fought separately. Patil had to quit the Congress after the NCP’s reluctance to give up its claim over the seat. Indapur has since been a fierce political battleground. The neighbouring Baramati constituency had recorded 70.09% . Senior state NCP leader and former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar is attempting to retain this constituency for the sixth successive term and finds himself pitted against BJP’s Gopichand Padalkar, who is seen as a political lightweight. In Ambegaon where NCP leader and former state assembly speaker Dilip Walse Patil, 67.38% of voters had exercised their franchise. Walse Patil is pitted against Shiv Sena’s Rajaram Bankhele. The former speaker will retain the seat for the seventh term if the poll result goes in his favour. The Maval constituency where minister of state for labour Bala alias Sanjay Bhegade is contesting, had recorded 69.20% voting. Bhegde is fighting against NCP’s Sunil Shelke, who left the BJP a few weeks before the election. The turnout was less in Purandar compared to the other rural Pune constituencies. Shiv Sena’s minister of state for water resources and water conservation Vijay Shivtare has been pitted against Congress’s Sanjay Chandukaka Jagtap. Daund constituency had recorded 71.38% while the voting in the remaining four constituencies hovered around 60 %. Junnar recorded 63.73%, Khed-Alandi 66.64% , Shirur 67.02% and Bhor 63.15%. In Daund, Rashtriya Samaj Paksha’s (RSP) sitting MLA Rahul Kool is contesting on a BJP symbol against NCP’s former MLA Ramesh Thorat. Kool’s political party is an alliance partner of the BJP. His wife, Kanchan Kool, had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha 2019 elections against NCP’s Supriya Sule from the Baramati LS constituency. At Bhor, Congress’ two-time sitting MLA Sangram Thopte is contesting against Shiv Sena’s Kuldip Konde. Thopte is one of the bright hopes for the Congress to retain his seat in a district that is otherwise dominated by the BJP-Sena combine. In Khed-Alandi, Shiv Sena’s sitting MLA Suresh Gore finds himself in a triangular fight with NCP’s former MLA Dilip Mohite and expelled BJP rebel Atul Deshmukh, who is contesting as an independent. Similarly, Junnar’s sitting MLA Sharad Sonawane, who won the 2014 elections on a Maharashtra Navnirman Sena ticket, but later on switched over to the Shiv Sena, is locked in a three-cornered fight with NCP’s Atul Benke and Sena rebel Asha Buchke, an independent.

Maharashtra assembly polls: Infighting and leadership crisis hit Shiv Sena hard in district | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Internal bickering, lacklustre leadership and neglect of loyalists cost Shiv Sena dearly as the party drew a blank in the district in the assembly polls. The Sena lost in all the assembly constituencies it contested in rural Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, including Purandar. Sitting MLA and minister Vijay Shivtare lost the fight at the site of the proposed airport against Congress’ Sanjay Jagtap. Sena had fielded candidates in Khed-Alandi, Ambegaon, Junnar, Purandar, Bhor and Pimpri. None of them tasted success. In the 2014 assembly polls, Sena had won Khed-Alandi, Purandar and Pimpri seats. The party’s wish was to improve its tally in this state elections. Sena’s electoral debacle in the district follows the defeat of its three-time MP Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year. He conceded that restructuring of the district unit of the party was necessary to revive its power in Pune. He also blamed BJP’s leaders and party workers for not following alliance “dharma” and working against the Sena candidates. “We have observed this trend in Khed-Alandi, Junnar and Purandar. In Khed-Alandi, senior BJP leaders backed the Independent candidate, who eventually polled more than 50,000 votes and made the task easier for the NCP candidate,” Patil told TOI over the phone In Junnar, they supported the Independent candidate to divide the party’s votes. This also benefited NCP eventually. Shivtare fought alone against NCP and Congress in Purandar. Had he got the support from BJP workers and leaders, the result would have been different. Many mid-level BJP leaders openly worked against our candidate, Gautam Chabukswar, in Pimpri and so we could not retain our seat, he added . A former president of Sena’s Pune district unit, who did not wish to be named, said, “The party’s leaders ignored long-time loyalist Asha Buchake, keen to contest from Junnar — traditionally known as Sena’s bastion. But the party gave ticket to Sharad Sonawane, who had joined Sena during the Lok Sabha elections. This did not go down well with the loyalists. Most of them worked against him and supported Buchake. Such issues need to be handled maturely at the district-level.” Sena’s sitting corporator in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) Rahul Kalate, who contested against BJP’s Laxman Jagtap as an Independent candidate in Chinchwad constituency, said, “Many sitting corporators of the party supported opposition candidates in this election. Such anti-party activity should not be ignored by the senior leaders.” Patil, the three-time Shirur MP, said he would work hard for strengthening the party in the district. “We want to promote ‘true Shiv Sainiks’, who can dedicate time and work hard to expand the party in the district. I shall present a detailed plan for this to the seniors,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra assembly polls: NCP rides high on local support, political legacy | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: BJP failed to repeat its 2014 all-seat-in-the-kitty performance in the city, as it conceded two seats — Wadgaon Sheri and Hadpasar — to NCP in the just-concluded assembly elections. Chetan Tupe of NCP, who is also the party’s city unit chief, had contested the election in 2014 from Hadapsar, but lost to BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar. In 2019, Tupe turned the table on Tilekar and handed him a defeat. Similarly, Sunil Tingre, who had lost to BJP’s Jagdish Mulik in Wadgaon Sheri five years ago, avenged the loss by defeating Mulik this time. The local NCP leadership attributed the two victories to Tupe and Tingre’s strong local connect, multi-corner fights and the voters’ emotional response to the visuals of the rain-soaked party chief, Sharad Pawar, addressing a rally in Satara. The success in the two constituencies is also the NCP’s best performance in the city till date in assembly elections. Tupe, who was the leader of the opposition in PMC, had initially decided against contesting the election on the ground that he had the new responsibility of being the NCP’s party chief. Hee got the poll ticket at the last minute. For Tupe, the victory has “fulfilled the dream” of his father late Vitthal Tupe, who was an MP from Pune. He said, “My father’s legacy has helped me in the assembly election. Besides, the citizens were fed up with the corrupt practices of the BJP leaders. The result is the people’s victory. The workers of our party and the alliance partners also working as a cohesive unit.” Tupe said issues such as garbage and water shortage would be on his priority list and he would ensure review meetings every three months. Tingre has been active in city politics for two decades and was associated with many political parties, including Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, before joining NCP ahead of the 2017 municipal elections. Ever since he became a corporator, Tingre had started preparing for the assembly elections. In 2014, Tingre had a close fight in Wadgaon Sheri when he had lost to Mulik by 5,000 votes. This time, the fight became more tough for Tingre after former NCP MLA Bapu Pathare, along with his supporters, joined BJP a few days before polling. The NCP leadership said Pathare’s decision to switch over to BJP indirectly helped Tingre, who got the sympathy of voters and NCP loyalists. NCP corporator Bhaiyasaheb Jadhav said, “The party is on the revival path. People are appreciating the efforts taken by our chief (Sharad Pawar) in the run-up to the elections. Both Tingre and Tupe are seasoned politicians and know the city better than many others.” BJP city chief Madhuri Misal said the party would conduct an in-depth analysis of the losses . “The candidates and former MLAs would be taken into confidence while discussing the two defeats. Such an analysis is needed to improve our party’s strength,” she said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Sitting MLA Bharati Lavekar of Shiv Sangram is the official BJP-Sena candidate, and former MLA Baldev Khosa who held office for 15 years makes the third corner of this triangular contest. MNS has fielded newcomer Sandesh Desai. Versova is a landscape of highrises in Lokhandwala Complex and Yari Road, middle class colonies like Mhada and sprawling slums in between. The construction of two Metro Rail lines has increased traffic jams. Illegal parking is a chronic malaise. But a perennial problem is one of encroachment. Illegal constructions and hutments have narrowed main roads, overrun Versova beach and denuded mangrove forests. For years, residents' associations have waged legal and civic battles over the issue. In Lokhandwala, patches of mangroves are burnt down surreptitiously in the middle of the night, or debris dumped on them. Candidates are walking a tightrope to satisfy both building residents and unlawful occupants. Lavekar, Patel and Khosa all promise to protect the beach and the mangroves — yet seek rehabilitation for densely populated slums. Lavekar said, “In Yari Road I completed 180m fencing of mangroves and 180m more will be done. I am simultaneously trying to rehabilitate Sagar Kutir hutments.” Khosa said, “Sagar Kutir settlers can and must be made eligible for rehabilitation.” Patel promises to protect settlers of mangroves. Lavekar is 100% confident of a victory. “Nobody likes a candidate who is rebelling against their own alliance (Patel),” she said. Patel said, “Lavekar has not performed. An MLA must be accessible. Ask those who have seen my work as corporator. My office is open till 1.00am. I help people with hospital admission and references.” Khosa said, “I have built 14-15 gardens. It was I who mooted a connecting bridge from Lokhandwala to Yari Road. I will complete the unfinished JVLR.” Versova has a large number of PMC Bank depositors who may vote NOTA.

Cheeta Camp and BARC: Netas struggle to bridge the two worlds | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: It’s an in-your-face dichotomy. The assembly constituency of Anushakti Nagar is clearly split into two worlds. While the congested Cheeta Camp is a hotbed of poverty and crime, the hub of intelligence—BARC. Cheeta Camp defies urban planning and defines life in a crammed space. From the road across, near Moinuddin School at Paylipada junction, Mohammed Imran sits with a team of volunteers arranging voter slips into bundles. “Drop them at the right address,” he tells a young burqaclad woman volunteer. Imran is assisting NCP spokesperson, former minister and party candidate from Anushakti Nagar Nawab Malik who lost the seat in 2014 to Sena’s Tukaram Kate by 1,007 votes and is now trying to wrest it back. Elsewhere, the fortified and well-planned residential BARC colony or Anushakti Nagar, from which the assembly gets its name, is home to some of the city’s and country’s most educated, prosperous scientists. A far cry from Cheeta Camp that yearns for development. “We have no complaints,” says scientific officer M A Ansari. “It’s a very comfortable life at BARC.” Malik claims he served the area well when he represented it between 2009 and 2014. “Some slums on the hills had no water in the last 40 years before I became the MLA. I arranged water pipes. There are problems galore... But after I lost the election, the man who replaced me [Kate] took no interest,” said Malik. Malik and other detractors of Kate accuse him of being a “true-blooded Sainik”, always ready for street fights. “Once in at a toll plaza in Mahableshwar, a staffer insisted that I pay toll despite being told that my vehicle was exempted... I took care of the arrogant man in our own way,” said Kate, adding he had brought water to deprived segments in his assembly. Other candidates like Akbar Hussain have confessed in affidavits of their “murky” past. While Malik faces many “vote cutters”, including MIM’s Sarfraz’s Shaikh, Kate too has to battle threats from MNS’s Vijay Raorane and BSP’s Jay Prakash Agarwal.

Maharashtra elections: Parties covet Virar-Vasai boomtown | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Virar-Vasai and Nalasopara assembly pocketboroughs are geared for a key poll fight which will test Hitendra Thakur's resilience and his political skills to retain his seat of over four decades, said analysts on the eve of the assembly elections on Monday. BJP strategists have been viewing the two state assembly contests with animated interest in view of the party's gameplan to make deep inroads into the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR)-including Virar-Vasai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli-in an attempt to clip Shiv Sena's wings, they added. The Sena won its political spurs in MMR in the 1990s and continues to be a force to reckon with in the region. The MMR takes in its sweep nine municipal corporations, and boasts 60 assembly constituencies, including the 36 in Mumbai. ""The region is growing at a frenetic pace, triggering unchecked migration and brisk construction activity. This explains why netas covet MMR as some kind of El Dorado,"" said a senior bureaucrat. This also explains why the BJP-Sena are squabbling over share of MMR seats. By recently inducting NCP leader Ganesh Naik and his corporators into the party, the BJP has ensconced itself comfortably in Navi Mumbai, said a party functionary. On the other hand, rebellion in Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli is a matter of concern for the saffron siblings. In the Kalyan (West) assembly constituency, Narendra Pawar, the sitting BJP MLA and a rebel, is in the poll fray against Sena's official candidate, while it is vice versa in Kalyan (East). Sanjay Kelkar, the BJP candidate in Thane (city), is finding it tough to assuage angry Shiv Sainiks, it is learnt. While the BVA may be patting itself on the back for being free of infighting, Thakur's key challenge is to keep all parties, chiefly the BJP, from impinging on his bastion, said BVA observers. ""Our strategy is to keep good equations with the party which wields power in the state. Hence, we don't see any threat from the BJP,"" said a BVA functionary. Fielding former cop Pradeep Sharma against Kshitij Thakur, Hitendra's Harvard-educated son and BVA candidate, in the Nalasopara constituency, and Vijay Patil against Hitendra in the Vasai constituency, could be the Sena's move to break the BVA's hold over Vasai taluka, which has become a haven for builders, said a veteran. Moreover, Sharma's candidature could be of a piece with Matoshree's strategy to persuade non-Marathis in the MMR to take a kind view of the party. The BVA, too, is undergoing a makeover. ""The new Thakur generation is eager to keep pace with the changing times. They have been holding art and sports festival every year. Stories of their misdeeds are a thing of the past. The BVA seems eager to take up infrastructure issues,"" said Chinmay Gavankar, an IT professional and Vasai-based local community worker. Sachin Tendulkar's presence at a sports event helmed by Kshitij in Vasai in 2017 marked the BVA's transformation, he said. A BVA strategist said the Virar-Vasai municipal corporation (annual budget: Rs. 1,500 crore) has teamed up with the MMRDA to undertake a slew of schemes to augment Vasai taluka's water supply through three phases of Surya river and to set up sewerage treatment plants. A plan to connect seven key roads to curtail travel hours is also ready, he added. Much depends, though, on whether the North Indian migrants from Nala Sopara retain their affection for the BVA or back Sharma out of community loyalty, said a Vasai chronicler.

Maharashtra elections: Mumbai slid into poll apathy while Delhi held its appetite | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: As Maharashtra goes to vote, a question in the corner of every pollster’s mind is, will the state capital submit a respectable franchise? The city’s election turnout in recent decades has been quite low compared to the other metros, certainly politics-mad Kolkata and Chennai. Sample this: Mumbai's turnout in the 2014 assembly election was 52%, as compared to Kolkata’s 69.4% in the 2016 West Bengal polls and Delhi’s 67.5% in its 2015 state polls. Chennai, with 18 assembly constituencies, scored a 60.5% turnout in the 2016 Tamil Nadu polls.Remarkably, 2014 was the first time since 1995 that Mumbai’s turnout crossed the 50% mark. Mumbai wasn’t always as apolitical. The city’s assembly poll turnout was over 60% till 1980, the highest-ever, 67.5%, being recorded in 1967. So, what changed? “The city’s very nature,” said a poll expert. The high turnouts of the past, experts say, owed to Mumbai’s very weft and warp: The city was the country’s industrial heartland, with a strong working-class ethic, great grassroots political organization, and a healthy students’ movement. “Down the decades, the factories closed down, and with that largescale political mobilization went out of the window,” an expert said. What lies in store this time? “The poll mood in the city doesn't look too upbeat. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, there was polarization around the Modi wave, making more people come out to vote. In the assembly polls, there is no such narrative,” said a political analyst. The weather and the long weekend too may play dampner. “Nevertheless, we tried to sensitise the electorate, and hope they come out and vote,” said chief electoral officer Baldev Singh. But predicting a dismal turnout, Surendra Jondhale, a political analyst, said that despite issues like Aarey and the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank scam, people won’t come out to vote. “Even if people are upset with the ruling parties over these issues, they will prefer not to vote rather than vote for other parties as the latter haven't even reached out to the public.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Team Aaditya Thackeray to occupy Shiv Sena centrestage today | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena is getting younger, and the strongest reflection of it is in the list of functionaries authorised to speak to the media for the party on the poll results on Thursday. As Aaditya Thackeray, the 29-year-old Sena scion, rises in the party, new faces like Varun Sardesai, Sainath Durge and Suraj Chavan are also gaining prominence. The ‘speakers’ list released by the Sena named 18 functionaries, and included Sardesai, a cousin of Aaditya who is also Yuva Sena secretary, Durge, a corporator who is one of the 12 members of Aaditya’s team, and Chavan, a close aide of the Yuva Sena chief. Senior leaders dropped from the list were state minister Eknath Shinde, Subhash Desai, MP Sanjay Raut, Anil Desai and star draw Aadesh Bandekar, considered close to Uddhav. New Sena voice: 7 women in party panel of 18 speakersSome of the others on the panel appointed to speak on behalf of the party were new inductees Priyanka Chaturvedi, a former national spokesperson of the Congress, Sachin Ahir, the former NCP city unit chief, and Kishore Kanhere, a former NCP politician. Other known faces named were MLC Manisha Kayande and corporator Sheetal Mhatre. A Yuva Sena functionary, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the role of Aaditya in the functioning of the party had increased and the Shiv Sena was benefiting from it. “Aadityaji has tried to keep a balance as the list has two seniors, Union minister Arvind Sawant and deputy chairperson of legislative council Neelam Gorhe as well as young MPs Rahul Shewale and Dhairyasheel Mane, besides Anil Parab and Sunil Shinde,” the Yuva Sena member said. “There is a Gujarati speaker, Hemraj Shah, former mayors Vishakha Raut and Shubha Raul, and three Yuva Sena members who will learn from the seniors.” The Yuva Sena functionary said that of the 18 on the panel, seven were women. A Shiv Sena functionary said much of the cadre was shocked when mass leader Shinde, the firebrand Raut, and master strategist Subhash Desai, Anil Desai, and celebrity campaigner Bandekar were dropped. In the Lok Sabha polls of 2014, Subhash Desai and Anil Desai had played a key role in the tie-up with the BJP. Reacting to the move, Raut said it was temporary in nature. “They are not appointed as spokespersons for all time but as a temporary arrangement to talk to the media,” he said. “It has nothing to do with me or the others. Finally, Uddhavji is our leader.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Election result Maharashtra 2019: Uddhav Thackeray talks about 50-50 formula for power sharing in Maharashtra | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: With trends of Assembly poll results in Maharashtra showing the BJP falling short of the halfway-mark on its own, its ally and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said it was time to implement ""fifty-fifty"" formula for power-sharing, decided on earlier. The BJP and Shiv Sena together were heading for a majority as the counting was going on Thursday. Addressing a press conference, when asked about which party will get the chief minister's post, Thackeray said, ""It is time to remind the BJP about the formula arrived at when BJP chief Amit Shah visited my home....we had decided on 50:50 formula for the alliance."" Describing the mandate as an ""eye-opener for many"", Thackeray said the people of the state had kept democracy alive. ""We had agreed to contest fewer seats (than the BJP), but I cannot accommodate the BJP every time. I should allow my party to grow,"" Uddhav said, indicating that he would drive a hard bargain. Keeping the suspense on the chief ministership alive, CM Devendra Fadnavis said, ""We are going to go ahead according to   what has been decided between Shiv Sena and us (BJP)   . You will get to know when the time is right."" 15 independent MLAs, most of them BJP and Shiv Sena rebels have contacted NDA with a willingness to support the alliance, Fadnavis added.

Maharashtra elections: More than 40 defectors in the poll fray | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Monday's elections to the state legislative assembly will be marked by the highest number of defectors in the fray in the state's political history. More than 40 former and sitting legislators from Congress and NCP quit and joined BJP or Shiv Sena for better political prospects and, in some cases, also to halt the on-going probe against them. Senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who has joined the BJP, leads the list of defectors. A month before the Lok Sabha elections, Vikhe Patil resigned from the party after his son was denied nomination as a Congress candidate from Ahmednagar. While his son was elected to the Lok Sabha on a BJP ticket, Vikhe Patil later joined BJP and was inducted into the state cabinet as housing minister. Vikhe Patil was followed by veteran NCP leader Jaidutta Kshirsagar, who also joined BJP and was inducted as cabinet member and allotted the employment guarantee scheme portfolio.

Maharashtra elections: Parties fish out phone numbers from vast databases for winning edge | Mumbai News - Times of India,"It may come across as an invasion of privacy, but political parties procured cellphone numbers from various sources for targeted campaigning as they felt voters tend to read mobile phone messages instead of pamphlets and advertisements. Various social organisations, including cultural groups and clubs, were a rich source to get cellphone numbers of voters in any constituency. A BJP leader from Ghatkopar said, ""There are organisations belonging to Jain Samaj, Brahman Samaj, Bhatia Community, etc, among Gujarati voters. We got contact numbers of voters from these organisations for free. We sent text messages to these numbers, and WhatsApp messages too."" A Shiv Sena leader from the western suburbs said, ""Apart from tapping community sources, we also try to get numbers from various residents' associations. We can directly send messages to voters about the work we did in a constituency and what we propose. Cellphone numbers are necessary to make any issue go viral among the electorate at the local level. It also helps counter propaganda by opponents."" Another set of source for getting such information is cellular companies taken together. A BJP leader explained, ""We get mobile number contacts within a particular radius in a constituency. However, the mobile numbers we get are limited to the subscribers of a particular operator. Hence, we have to get numbers from all operators. We get these at very cheap rates, for example for 5,000 to 20,000 per set."" There was yet another source of numbers. Data collected for the implementation of the farm loan waiver scheme was used by political parties to reach out to the beneficiaries. Overall, any database of beneficiaries of various schemes was used for political outreach. ""During the loan waiver scheme, lakhs of farmers were asked for data, including their contact numbers and family details. This was used by parties to reach out to voters,"" said a source. Other schemes that yielded cellphone numbers included Mhada lottery, scholarships, and government financing for women self-help groups. For example, to woo women voters, meetings were held between self-help groups and government agencies in recent months, and data on the participants collected. In poll season, these women were contacted again with an appeal ""to vote for the right party"". How effective is outreach using such means? ""Very. Outreach is based on the language the beneficiary speaks, the issues he faces,"" explained a source. ""It's targeted campaigning."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra elections: 'Many depend on MLAs for school, hospital admissions' | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: ""People call an MLA for everything under the sun. From school admissions, medical aid to even family issues. I've got calls even when someone was caught by a traffic cop for violations,"" said Amin Patel, Congress legislator from Mumbadevi. Placed between MPs, vital links with the Central government, and corporators, who are more informed on civic issues, the relevance of MLAs seems to have shrunk. Their chief role is to legislate, but increasingly they are being judged on the use of their Rs 2 crore annual development fund and their accessibility to the public. Naseem Khan, MLA from Chandivli, said constituents flock to an MLA for civic issues when corporators are unhelpful. ""I have done everything from laying pipelines to constructing toilets in my constituency,"" said Khan. For years, the mantra for winning elections has been ""meter, gutter and water"", said Sanjay Patil, research assistant, department of civics and politics, Mumbai University, indicating an attempt to build vote banks. ""In the use of local area development fund, there is a nexus between officials, contractors and the MLA. The contractor helps the MLA win an election and the latter ensures he is never out of business. So there is really no focus on law-making,"" Patil added. Raising issues votal to the state, debating them and making laws is the area where MLAs, records show, are faltering and, thus perhaps, leading to an emasculation of their role and relevance in public life. The assembly allows an elected representative to raise issues of public importance, but data shows the number of questions raised has fallen; veterans said quality of debates too has dipped. ""Discussions in assembly on issues like drought, increase in crime and on bills would go on for hours...that would happen because MLAs were in touch with ground realities,"" said a seasoned MLA. Through debates on bills, legislators can contribute to drafting of laws, but very few now make the effort to study and speak on a bill, said political observers. Often speeches are repetitive or do not touch on the subject under discussion, added the MLA. However, a seven-term MLA who is contesting again said this lacunae has had no effect on an MLA's interactions with the public. Rather expectations have only risen. ""They come to us with issues expecting it to be solved immediately,"" said the MLA. Amin Patel said on an average, 150 people come to meet him every day and their problems are varied. He makes an effort to be in his office five days a week and has a rapport with BMC, government and police officers. He maintains relations with doctors of KEM, JJ and Nair hospital too as many people not only from his constituency but outside the city visit him requesting for help with admission in these hospitals. ""There are at least 20-25 people I send to these hospitals in one week. I get calls from Malegaon, Bhiwandi too,"" said Patel. Better civic infrastructure and services in big cities mean dependence on MLAs for public projects has declined. But outside cities, legislators are still critical representatives of authority as there are not many officials or public figures who can be approached by citizens to put forward their needs and difficulties. But regardless of region, they had better deliver. ""There is a lot more feedback that is given, which didn't happen earlier,"" said the seven-time MLA.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: 164 seats for BJP &amp; smaller allies, 124 for Shiv Sena | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The BJP-Shiv Sena's seat-sharing formula for the October 21 assembly polls was finally officially declared only on Friday evening, after the deadline for filing nominations for all 288 seats had passed. According to it, the BJP has got 164 seats, of which it has given 14 to its smaller allies, and the Sena has got 124, indubitably confirming the BJP's supremacy over its alliance partner in the state. CM Devendra Fadnavis said at a joint press conference with Sena president Uddhav Thackeray that the BJP would be fighting 150 seats, its smaller allies 14, and the Sena would get ""124 seats plus two."" The additional ""two"" would be on the state legislative council, sources said. The BJP had been trying to persuade its smaller allies such as the RPI (Athavale group), the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, Shiv Sangram and Rayat Kranti to contest the polls on the 'lotus' symbol. Asked about this, Fadnavis said some of them had asked for the 'lotus' symbol while some others hadn't, though he did not specify the numbers. It is learnt that the RPI (A), Shiv Sangram and Rayat Kranti candidates will contest on the 'lotus' symbol, while the Mahadev Jankar-led Rashtriya Samaj Paksha will fight on its own symbol. Many BJP and Sena aspirants have filed nomination as rebels. Fadnavis said both parties will ask the rebels to withdraw their nominations in the next two days (October 7 is the last date for withdrawal) and if they fail to do so, they will not get any position in the alliance and ""we will show them their place"" in the polls. Thackeray also said that these issues arise in every election and would be sorted out in the next two-three days. The Sena is facing rebellion in Matoshree's backyard, the Bandra East constituency. Its sitting MLA there, Trupti Sawant, has filed nomination against the party's official candidate, Mumbai mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar. Rajul Patel, a corporator from Versova who is considered a hardcore Sena activist, has also filed nomination as an Independent as the seat has been allotted to smaller ally Shiv Sangram; Chandrakant Patil in Muktainagar (Jalgaon) and Vilas Shinde in Nashik West are among the other Sena rebels. In the BJP, Murji Patel former BJP corporator from Andheri East and Santosh Janathe in Boisar were among those who filed nominations against the official party candidates.

"Maharashtra assembly polls: Marathis and Gujaratis bond over Modi, Hindutva | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Regardless of the low turnout of voters on Monday, the Marathis and Gujaratis together have emerged as the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena alliance’s most durable votebank in the city, according to preliminary reports compiled by saffron candidates. In fact, both the BJP and Sena seemed least perturbed by the poor turnout. “Our loyal voters -- the Marathis, Gujaratis and the north Indians -- have stood by us,” said a senior city BJP leader on Monday. While support from Marathi voters to the Sena in constituencies where it had put up its candidates was near-total, they backed the BJP in equal measure, he added. Setting aside community loyalty, the mercantile community also backed Sena candidates in Marathi-dominated constituencies such as Mumbadevi, Worli, Mahim, Sewri and Byculla because of the BJP agenda: revoking of Article 370, Uniform Civil Code and the surgical strikes on Pakistan, said a Sena functionary. Sena president Uddhav Thackeray won over the mercantile community by repeatedly referring to the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, echoing the views of Hindutva supporters. Also, Aaditya Thackeray is seen by Mumbai’s traders as a young Sena leader who is willing to make a clean break from his party’s rough and ready style of politics, while the north Indians too are willing to shed their inhibitions about the Sena, he added. Ex-Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said north Indians and Gujaratis-Marwaris have become, post-2014, the BJP’s “silent majority.” “Once the three communities were the Mumbai Congress’s bulwark,” he pointed out. In Sena constituencies, senior Sena leaders made it a point to build bridges with Gujarati-Marwari voters, canvassing support for the Marathi candidate, sources said. The BJP too practised the technique with finesse. “The Gujaratis in my constituency have always backed the BJP, irrespective of the candidate’s community. Also, the BJP’s Marathi candidates bond pretty well with the traders’ community,” said Parag Alavani, the BJP MLA from Vile Parle who is contesting against Jayanti Siroya, a Gujarati from the Congress party. However, Gujarati traders were in a fix in constituencies where both principal protagonists were Marathis. For instance, Sada Sarvankar, the sitting Sena MLA, locked horns with MNS’ Sandeep Deshpande in Mahim. In Magathane, Sena MLA Prakash Surve took on MNS’ Nayan Kadam, while BJP MLA Manisha Chaudhary faced two Marathi candidates --Arun Sawant of the Congress and Rajesh Yerunkar (MNS) -- in Dahisar. “Under such circumstances the Gujarati-Marwari voters may have refrained from going to the voting station,” said a BJP worker from Dahisar, adding, “But the final picture of constituency-wise voting patterns will emerge in a day or two.” Mumbadevi came as an interesting example of the Gujarati-Marathi bond cemented by Modi’s appeal and local calculations, said observers. Of 11 candidates in the fray in this populous hub of small traders, eight were Muslims, while Keshav Mulay (MNS), Pandurang Sakpal (Sena) and Udaykumar Shiroorkar (Independent) were Marathis. “It is a foregone conclusion that Gujarati-Marwaris backed Sena’s Sakpal,” said Satish Khamkar, a Sena sympathiser.

"60.5% turn out to vote in Maharashtra, 50.5% in Mumbai | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: At 60.5%, Maharashtra’s voter turnout in the state polls was almost on par with the Lok Sabha election six months ago and 2.5% lower than the 2014 assembly election. At 50.5%, though, the turnout in Mumbai saw a steep 4.6% drop from that for the LS polls; it was marginally lower by 1.3% than the 2014 assembly polls. These are provisional figures provided by the Election Commission which could change as the data is finalized. The highest voter turnout in the city was in the eastern suburb of Bhandup at 56.9% where the Shiv Sena dropped a sitting MLA in favour of a corporator. The lowest turnout was in Colaba—40.2%—home to the tony Cuffe Parade . In the run-up to the state election, there were concerns about a low turnout given the lacklustre campaign, an opposition weakened by defections and the absence of major poll issues. The polling date also came after a long weekend and was close to Diwali, which many felt would reduce the turnout further. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Ruling party ignoring real issues, says Kanhaiya Kumar | Aurangabad News - Times of India","AURANGABAD: Former JNU student union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Thursday accused the ruling party of drifting from real issues like basic amenities, education, health and employment. Addressing an election rally for Communist Party of India (CPI) candidate from Aurangabad Central Abhay Taksal at the Aamkhas ground, he said propoganda was earlier used by companies to sell their products, but political leaders are using the tool with ulterior motives “Basic issues are being sidelined and topics such as Article 370, Pakistan and Ram Mandir are being raked up for political gains. Have all the problems ended with abrogation of Article 370? If BJP is coming back to power and if there is no alternative to PM Modi, why is there a need for elections,” asked Kanhaiya. On the poll promise of BJP to confer Bharat Ratna on Veer Savarkar, Kanhaiya took potshots at the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, which is being ruled by the Shiv Sena and BJP. “I was passing by the Savarkar chowk in the city and found that the entire road was full of potholes. If they cannot build good roads at Savarkar chowk, what good is in giving him the highest civilian honour,” he asked “Stray dogs in Aurangabad have learnt from the leaders to attack people. The civic body cannot control the dog menace across the city. For the last several years, they have been saying that a water pipeline will be laid, but all they have done is inflate the Rs 300-crore project to Rs 1,650 crore,” said Kanhaiya. He said CPI candidate Taksal has been fighting for issues of people and appealed to the masses to vote wisely during the assembly elections. Kanhaiya condemned attempts to rename Aurangabad after Sambhaji Maharaj and said that if those who want this should instead put in efforts to build a new city. The CPI candidate has come to people with a 35-point agenda related to people’s issues and hence he should be voted as MLA. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

The demand for better garbage management was part of a manifesto the PCCF released on Thursday. Members also demanded fixes for the water shortage crisis across Pimpri Chinchwad while urging elected representatives to make arrangements for water to be lifted from the Bhama Askhed and Andra dams. The manifesto also included demands to extend the Metro corridor till Nigdi in the first phase, the deployment of e-buses and the setting up of more air pollution monitoring devices for the entire area. Balanced development, members said, should be ensured across all the three assembly constituencies - Pimpri, Chinchwad and Bhosari. Residents said there is also a need for equitable development of villages located outside the municipal limits. They demanded a river rejuvenation project be implemented for the Pavana and Indrayani rivers instead of a river improvement project. Boating, water sports and other activities will increase tourism, they said. The manifesto asked for better river protection measures as well. Members said MLAs should ensure the floodlines in the area are not changed to accommodate fresh construction. They said sewage treatment plants be built at key locations to stop ejection of untreated seawge into water bodies of the constituencies. On controls on industrial units, residents said a common effluent treatment plant (CETP) be built to treat industrial effluents for reducing river pollution. The treated water of STPs, instead of being released into rivers, should be recycled, the manifesto said.

"Omraje Nimbalkar attacker held, seeks CM Devendra Fadnavis’s help in video | Aurangabad News - Times of India","AURANGABAD: Ajinkya Tekale, the 25-year-old who attacked Shiv Sena MP Omraje Nimbalkar on Wednesday, had shot a video minutes before the police arrested him early on Thursday morning. In the video, Tekale blamed the MP for unemployment in the area and hurting the local BJP unit. Calling himself a “loyal BJP worker”, Tekale also sought help from Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for his bail. “He (Nimbalkar) shut down the (Terna) sugar factory and caused large-scale unemployment. Many people were left many homeless. Also, due to his rebellion, the BJP is suffering. Nimbalkar doesn’t give any importance to our party,” the attacker can be seen saying in the video. Meanwhile, speaking with TOI, Nimbalkar denied all the allegations. “The NCP leadership had instigated the workers to go on a strike, which led to the factory lockdown. I had mortgaged my personal property to take a loan of Rs 287 crore, and I paid all the dues to every worker. The attacker was a teenager when the factory was shut down seven years ago. Neither he, nor his family members, were employed at the factory,” he said. Rubbishing other allegations levelled against him in Tekale’s video, Nimbalkar said it is up to the police to investigate whether there is a larger political conspiracy behind the assault on him. “When my father was murdered in 2006, I was written off by my opponents. Despite opposition from my family, I joined active politics and have reached where I am today. I am up against old arch-rivals in addition to new enemies who are jealous of my political rise,” he said. Nimbalkar said he has sought additional police protection in the wake of Wednesday’s attempt on his life. “I received minor injuries on the left hand and stomach. I have written to the Osmanabad police for additional protection,” he said. Shivaji Gurme, the Shiradhon Police station in-charge, said Tekale was arrested nearly 5km from the attack spot at 1 am on Thursday. “We produced the accused before the local court, which has remanded him in police custody till October 22. Contrary to earlier information, Tekale is of sound mental health. We have seen the video he shot before his arrest. His interrogation will provide further leads,” Gurme said. The attacker has been booked under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC, said the police. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Anti-quota movement to opt for NOTA | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: The state-wide movement — Save Merit Save Nation (SMSN) — against alleged excess reservation in the state has asserted that they will opt for NOTA during the assembly elections. The decision comes in the wake of the newly introduced quota for the economically weaker sections and the Maratha community. Stating that parties cutting across political ideologies supported both the quotas unanimously, causing irrevocable damage to the open category students in the educational sector, SMSN said that its members and supporters will remain aloof from voting as ‘a show of strength.’ Among all established parties, BJP may take a hit due to the stand as the voters in question are traditionally considered as the party’s assured vote bank. “Excess reservation is going to ruin our next generation from all walks of life. It is time we show our strength and solidarity. Let’s create our own ‘vote bank’ and fight for justice,” read a statement issued by anti-quota movement. Clarifying that the NOTA decision is not against any caste, creed, religion or political party, SMSN stressed that it wants “justice and only justice for merit.” A core committee member of the anti-quota movement said that SMSN groups in most of the districts have unanimously decided to opt for NOTA in the upcoming elections.

But Lokhande, a Janahit Lokshahi Party candidate being fielded from the Chinchwad assembly constituency, never allowed the “different than others” tag to deter her. In a constituency that is viewed as a safe seat for the BJP, Lokhande is contesting against 11 candidates, including the BJP’s sitting MLA Laxman Jagtap, a two-time legislator, and Rahul Kalate, an independent backed by the NCP. “This election will be more than just winning or losing. I am fighting for the dignity of my identity here. It’s an achievement for me when people attend my campaign meets and listen to what I have to say,” Lokhande, a hotel management graduate, told TOI. She runs a clothing store at Pirangut, an enterprise she said she started after not finding opportunies in the hospitality sector because of her identity. “I am now focusing on issues in Chinchwad, which has been neglected for years. Citizens here are deprived of basic amenities such as drinking water, quality roads and steady electricity supply. My aim is to change things,” said Lokhande. Lokhande said her plan for an inclusive campaign involves travelling to nearly every locality within the constituency. “I have covered almost every corner of my constituency.

"Maharashtra assembly polls 2019: BJP casts the net wide in Baramati, Indapur and Daund | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: The groundwork for Bharatiya Janata Party’s “Mission Baramati 2024” is gathering steam in the runup to the state assembly polls. The party has put out an aggressive strategy to breach three key constituencies — Baramati, Indapur and Daund — which are part of the Baramati parliamentary constituency where the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has a strong network. In the last leg of poll campaigning, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis entrusted the party’s senior leader and strategist Girish Mahajan, with the task of taking on Ajit Pawar in Baramati. In Indapur, Fadnavis himself, along with senior party leaders, including Union minister Smriti Irani, have thrown their weight behind Harshvardhan Patil, a senior Congress leader, who recently ditched his party and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. The BJP had announced its “Mission Baramati 2024” plan during Lok Sabha elections. The party’s state president Chandrakant Patil had claimed Baramati, which has been the bastion of NCP chief Sharad Pawar for decades, will have a BJP MP after the next Lok Sabha polls. The party had pitted Kanchan Kool, wife of Rahul Kool, sitting MLA of Daund, against Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule on a BJP ticket, though the Kool family allies itself with Rashtriya Samaj Paksha. The BJP’s move to fight Baramati Lok Sabha seat on the party ticket was aimed at an expansion in the region. A similar strategy is on for the forthcoming assembly polls — Rahul Kool will contest from Daund on the party’s symbol. Sources from the BJP are confident of winning Indapur and Daund seats and expect a tough fight in Baramati. The party has pitched Gopichand Padalkar, a Dhangar community leader, against Ajit Pawar. Padalkar had fought the Lok Sabha election on a Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi ticket from Sangli. Baramati has a strong Dhangar community. Padalkar’s candidature may benefit the BJP in gaining more votes. A senior BJP leader said: “Of the six assembly constituencies in the Baramati Lok Sabha constituency, three (Khadakwasla, Purandar, Daund) are already with the saffron alliance. After the 2019 assembly polls, Indapur will be with BJP. Our candidate, Harshvardhan Patil, is a strong local leader and has done a lot of work for Indapur’s development. Only two seats remain and we are hopeful of winning both — Bhor and Baramati — soon,” the leader added. The NCP is confident of an easy win in Baramati, senior leaders from the party said. “Sule’s winning margin increased in the recent Lok Sabha polls as against the 2014 elections despite the BJP’s many claims. Indapur seat was won by the NCP in 2014 and this year too, voter sentiments are completely with the NCP. Patil’s induction in BJP will not dent the NCP’s propsects,” a senior leader from NCP said.

Maharashtra: Voter enrolment deadline tweet confuses citizens | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The Maharashtra Information Centre (MIC) tweeted that there was still time to register as a voter on Saturday, four days after the deadline had ended in Maharashtra. The tweet on September 28 read, “Yes, still time is there ... (sic) You can register or amend your voter details online on the nvstp.in website, in addition to the usual methods, you can change details,” confusing many citizens. As per Election Commission of India, the deadline to register as a voter was on September 24, 10 days before the last date for the filing of nominations. Citizen activist Ravindra Sinha blamed poor coordination between EC officials and MIC, and said this would have encouraged many to register and hope to find their name in the rolls for the October 21 elections. “There is a total lack of coordination among the authorities. The election authorities did not promote the ECI app, which makes it easy for voter updation and registration. Had they promoted it well, there would have been better voter registration,” Sinha said. There were some who, after seeing the tweet, had re-applied after not seeing their name on the draft electoral roll. “Voters are confused about the last date of registration and there were not enough camps conducted for registration ahead of the polls,” a new voter said. “The tweet has created quite a flutter among IT professionals and was shared on social media. As the source was the Maharashtra Information Centre, nobody doubted it,” a techie, who tried to have his friend enrolled after seeing the tweet, said. “I am from West Bengal and I submitted my form on Saturday after a local leader in our area said I could still register. But I’m informed by activists that my name will not show up in the electoral roll for the upcoming elections,” Nilima, 37 years old, said.

"Vote on Monday, says PM Narendra Modi; many make travel plans | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday urged citizens to vote on Monday and not take a long weekend holiday. Speaking at a rally here, Modi said the holiday on Monday should be utilized to vote and not to travel to Goa, Mumbai or Mahabaleshwar. Over the years, there has been a rising trend of urban voters using taking advantage of voting day — when schools and some offices are shut — to take a short holiday, rather than stay back and vote. The candidates are taking steps to ensure a high turnout on Monday. “More and more people are now looking forward to casting their vote. Many people are more inclined towards voting when the leadership is trustworthy,” BJP’s Shivajinagar candidate Siddharth Shirole said. Travel firms in the city, while conceding that the Monday holiday may have contributed to the 30-40% surge in travel bookings for this weekend, also said the numbers were up as travel would be considerably more expensive the following weekend, which coincides with Diwali. Diwali vacations start from October 19 in several schools, and families are planning weeklong holidays, travel firms said. Some working professionals, meanwhile, are opting for a three-day break this weekend to avoid paying a bomb for hotels and flights on the Diwali weekend. “Goa is the popular pick, while those planning a shorter break are going to Dapoli, Alibaug and other beach destinations. Hill stations like Mahabaleshwar and Matheran are off the menu for now,” Girish Makhijani, who owns Hare Krishna Comfort Tours, said. Makhijani said many have planned their travel for this weekend, as Diwali falls on the next Sunday. “People usually like to celebrate the festival at home. Compared to other weekends, bookings for this weekend are up 40%,” he said. One travel firm owner said people will prefer to combine voting day with a weekend as it means a longer weekend. “I feel voting day should not have been fixed on a Monday,” he said. The Travel Agents Association of Pune (TAAP) said it is appealing to travellers to ensure they’re in town for voting day. “Many are planning to leave the city on Friday evening and return by Monday afternoon, but we have advised them to try and return in the morning so that they can vote,” TAAP director Nilesh Bhansali said. Vikas Agrawal, director of V T Travel Pvt Ltd, said some of his clients were returning to Pune on Sunday evening, but most will come back only on Monday evening or Tuesday. “Those going to Goa are coming back to Pune on October 20 evening,” Hrishikesh Kolhapure, director (operations), KK Travels, said.

"Maharashtra assembly polls 2019: Vada pav, once a campaign staple, is out as parties pick custom meals | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Vada pav, a snack that has been staple diet during election campaigns in the city for decades, is no longer the favourite food of choice for candidates or party staff. Political parties are now offering their 'karyakartas' or workers full meals, prepared by in-house cooks, home cooks or lunch homes in Pune. According to some popular vada pav vendors in the city, the demand for vada pav during election campaigns has dropped significantly over the last decade. ""Earlier, we would get orders for 500 to 1,000 pieces of vada pav almost daily, sometimes even twice a day. Now we get orders for some 50-odd vada pavs - on and off. Last Sunday, we delivered 50 pieces for workers of a political party, but we haven't received any other fresh orders,"" said the owners of Khatri Bandhu Wadewale, located behind Balgandharva Rangmandir. Atul Bharti, the owner of Bharti Vadewale, located close to Congress Bhavan said: ""We have delivered around 300 vada pavs for the election campaign over the past two days, but the demand is meagre compared to the years gone by. My father started the eatery 45 years ago and over the years, we saw bulk orders of 200 or 300 vada pavs twice a day. During such times, we would need to call for reinforcements as the team of five - three employees, my wife and I - was insufficient."" Bharti stated that parties are now hiring in-house cooks, who prepare full meals for the party workers. ""Only if the number of people is excess and the food is insufficient, do they opt for vada pav,"" he explained. Shubham Adhav, manager of Joshi Vadewale, too, stated that hardly any bulk orders for election campaigns have been received this election season. According to representatives from Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, vada pav was very popular earlier but it failed to satiate hunger. ""We have got cooks on board instead who prepare tea and snacks like poha or upma for breakfast. For lunch, we provide a proper meal including sabzi, dal, chapati and rice. It is homely food so that workers do not face health problems,"" the party's workers on the ground said. Meanwhile, Kiran Sali from the Shiv Sena, said they have been refraining from serving their workers oily food due to the erratic weather. ""Vada pav is quite oily and can cause problems with the throat. Also, many alternatives for snacks are available like poha, kacchi dabeli and others. We provide the party workers with a proper breakfast. For lunch, we have distributed coupons for vegetarian lunch homes in the city.

"Maharashtra assembly polls 2019: Liquid diet, workouts help candidates go the extra mile | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Logging in 14-15 hours for campaigning is all in a day’s work for most candidates fighting the assembly polls. The secret of their energy is fairly simple -- eating frugal meals, staying hydrated, and continuing with their fitness routine. With just two days left for campaigning, some candidates are keeping a watch on their diets and having only liquids during the day. Others are going for fruit diet and munching dry fruits during breaks. There are some who are continuing with their morning fitness regime and going for a walk early in the morning or working out at home with personal trainers. BJP candidate from Shivajinagar constituency, Siddharth Shirole, said, “I exercise regularly. My fitness mantra is consistency over intensity. I also follow a very balanced diet which involves partaking of home-cooked food in appropriate proportions. Presently, I am focusing on maintaining a healthy diet.” Party’s Hadapsar candidate, sitting MLA Yogesh Tilekar, said, “I am so used to walking in the area that the padyatras are not doing any damage to my health. But, I am ensuring that my diet is maintained and the stress is mainly on liquids as the heat is more in afternoon for the past couple of days.” Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) candidate from Wadgaonsheri, Sunil Tingre said his regular workout at the gym helped him during campaigning as he had to travel long distance to visit different areas of his constituency. “I eat in small quantities as heavy meal tends to make one feel lazy. I carry some dry fruits with me during campaigns to keep the energy level going.” MP Supriya Sule, who is campaigning for NCP candidates across the length and breadth of Maharashtra, is a fitness freak. Despite her tight schedule, she has made it a point to keep up with the fitness regime. “It’s not such a big deal. Fitness is all in the mind. Time management is important and I feel that if there is a will, there is a way. I don’t overthink my fitness as it’s my lifestyle elections, or no elections,” she said, adding that fitness for her was a matter of choice and lifestyle.

Maharashtra elections: 'Shiv Sena pact with BJP was due to move on Article 370' | Mumbai News - Times of India,"THANE/MUMBAI: Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said his party's decision to seal a pre-poll pact with BJP was largely influenced by the Modi regime's move to scrap the controversial Article 370. The announcement is largely seen as an attempt to silence critics who have been raising questions over the party's move to accommodate for lesser seats in the alliance. The announcement gains importance especially after Modi recently dared political opponents to rewind Article 370 in the Valley. The Sena president, in Thane to campaign for saffron alliance candidates, praised the 'nationalism' of Veer Savarkar as he forcefully iterated the demand for a Bharat Ratna to be conferred on him. The support for Bharat Ratna could help Sena not only find favour among Marathi-speaking people in Thane, which also has a sizeable Hindu population, but also grow closer to BJP, that has been idealising Savarkar. Earlier, in Manvelpada, Virar (E) to campaign for Nalasopara candidate, Pradeep Sharma, and Vasai candidate, Vijay Patil, he said, in Vasai-Virar, water does not come from taps, it comes from doors, referring to flooding in the region this year. Despite Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) having a majority in the municipality, it could not find a solution to the flood, Thackeray said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra Election: Congress grappled with doubts, and Shiv Sena missed deadline | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: A section of NCP, which had taken the lead in persuading Uddhav Thackeray to form a non-BJP government, blamed ally Congress for Monday’s fiasco involving Shiv Sena. Congress is dithering on supporting the Sena-led government as it feels that if the Sena-NCP and Congress comes to power, it will strengthen NCP and, in the months to come, Congress will be wiped out, said a senior NCP leader. “We feel that Congress backed out at the last moment since it will help Sharad Pawar to widen his party’s base across the state. In the recent past, NCP’s mass base was dwindling, but after the assembly elections, it was found that it has made deeper inroads than ever before. Now, if Sena forms government with NCP and Congress, NCP will be the biggest beneficiary,’’ he said. Indicating that Pawar has been slighted, he said: “Almost for the entire day, Sharad Pawar was camping in the Y B Chavan Centre with the hope that Congress will provide support for formation of government.” Pawar was told all along on Monday that Sonia was interacting with Congress leaders, including legislators from Maharashtra, and that a positive decision will be taken soon. But late in the evening, AICC said it needed more discussions with NCP. Senior leaders will meet on Tuesday to work out a strategy, and the leader is still hopeful of a Sena-NCP and Congress government. Sources said Monday’s fiasco is being viewed as a setback for Pawar since he was seen as taking a lead in mobilising non-BJP parties. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Maharashtra assembly elections: Housing societies take lead for better polling | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Several housing societies have, instead of waiting for an order from the cooperation department, come forward to appoint their office bearers as booth-level volunteers to ensure a better voter turnout in the October 21 Maharashtra assembly elections. The Lok Sabha elections earlier this year had seen a little over than 60% turnout in the state, following which the election department targeted to ensure that at least 70% people got inked during the assembly polls. Volunteers working on the ground to improve the voters’ awareness are unhappy with the cooperation department’s delay in issuing the mandatory appeal to the housing societies. “Once the Election Commission of India issues us the direction, we will immediately issue the order to the housing societies,” a senior cooperation department official said.

"Maharashtra government formation: Congress dithers, governor times out Sena, calls NCP | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Amid hectic political parleys and high drama, Shiv Sena exited its long-standing alliance with BJP on Monday but suffered a body blow when its attempt to cobble together a government of Maha Shiv Aghadi—comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress—flopped as it could not produce support letters by the 7.30pm deadline and governor B S Koshyari refused more time. Shortly, the governor called NCP legislature party chief Ajit Pawar to Raj Bhavan and asked him to indicate within 24 hours whether his party was “willing and able to form government”. NCP said it will hold meetings with Congress before a decision. The day’s developments meant that even 18 days after election results, the people of Maharashtra do not have a government. It emerged that despite Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray meeting Pawar and calling Sonia Gandhi, the party was unable to secure letters of support from Congress and NCP, though it said it had “in principle” support from both. “On the plea of NCP, not only our Cabinet member quit government, but Shiv Sena too is out of NDA. Now, we are nowhere. We are surprised over the attitude of Congress and NCP,” a Sena leader said. However, sources said, the party has not given up all hope and is mulling moving the high court against the governor’s stern decision. Congress general secretary Avinash Pande said Raj Bhavan has not rejected Sena’s claim, and his party is still keen to support a Sena-led government, in collaboration with NCP. “We felt that before taking a major decision, more consultation was required, particularly on terms and conditions. We are hopeful Maharashtra will have a government comprising Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP, we have not rejected the proposal,’’ said Pande. On Monday evening, Sena leader Aditya Thackeray, accompanied by legislature party leader Eknath Shinde, submitted a letter to Koshyari, saying the party has the support of legislators required for government formation and sought more time. But Thackeray failed to produce letters of support, and Koshyari rejected the plea for extension of time. “Governor expressed his inability to give any further extension,” an official release said. Monday started with Sena’s only Union minister Arvind Sawant resigning from PM Modi’s government in Delhi, signalling the exit of BJP’s oldest ally from NDA. It was a condition NCP had set, and soon Thackeray, who was emerging as a CM candidate, met with Sharad Pawar in a city hotel. In New Delhi, the Congress Working Committee met to discuss supporting a Sena-led government. It seemed inconclusive, and soon Thackeray called Sonia and in a seven-minute conversation is said to have sought Congress support. But this and Pawar’s interactions with Sonia and Ahmed Patel did not bring a positive result. Congress held another meeting with state leaders, and then tersely released a letter saying it needed to hold more talks with ally NCP before deciding on its course of action. On, Tuesday, NCP will have to play its cards. “Ajit Pawar received call from Raj Bhavan in the evening. When he went there, he was handed a letter asking to indicate his willingness for formation of government within 24 hours,” party spokesperson Nawab Malik said. He was non-committal on whether NCP will seek support of Congress and Sena. “I am not sure if Shiv Sena will extend support to us,” said Malik. AICC general secretary Pande felt that Raj Bhavan has not rejected Sena’s claim, it has only declined to grant extension for submitting letters of support. “In our opinion, Shiv Sena’s claim still stands and Raj Bhavan will have to accept if Shiv Sena submits supporting documents,” said Pande. After meeting the governor, Aaditya Thackeray said: “We have shown the willingness to form government and had asked the governor for more time as the two parties we are in talks with are yet to complete their procedure. Our demand for an extension was rejected, but our claim stands.” He said the two parties had given “in principle” support but it will take a few more days. “The process has started, we will come back with everyone,” he said on Monday evening. Sena leader Anandrao Adsul said they told the governor that they have the support of 161 MLAs, including NCP and Congress, and the smaller allies and Independents but they gave only the letter of support of their MLAs to the governor.

"Maharashtra elections: Two MLAs back Shiv Sena, take tally to 60 seats | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Shiv Sena's confidence to get an upper hand in the power tussle for government formation is growing as the party has got support from two legislators from Prahar Janshakti Party (PJP), taking its total seat tally to 60. Increasing support from smaller parties and rebel candidates who contested as independents and won will boost Shiv Sena's confidence to bargain for more seats and key portfolios in the state government in the power-sharing talks with the BJP. On Saturday, PJP MLAs Omprakash alias Bachhu Kadu, who was elected for the fourth time from Achalpur constituency in Amravati district, and Rajkumar Patel, who won from the tribal-dominated Melghat constituency, met Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and offered 'conditional' support. Sena's Maratha face Eknath Shinde took the two PJP legislators to Matoshree. Before extending his support to the Sena, Kadu discussed various issues with Thackeray, said sources. ""The government should provide employment opportunities for farm labourers under government scheme, including activities related to sowing to harvesting. Divyang and the tribal community should also get jobs under government schemes. The Sena has assured that they will try to address the demands,"" said Kadu. Sena has also assured Kadu that all pending issues related to citizens, tribals and the specially challenged of Achalpur and Melghat constituencies will be sorted out. On Thursday, immediately after the assembly polls results were announced two Sena rebels who had contested as independents and won -Ashish Jaiswal representing Ramtek and Narendra Bhondekar from Bhandara constituency-met Thackeray and declared support to the party. On Saturday, while addressing party MLAs at Matoshree, Thackeray hinted that the Sena is likely explore other options, if the BJP would not agree on 50-50 formula for power-sharing. The Sena is demanding that the BJP sign an agreement on 'sharing of power' formula and insist for the CM post for 2.5-year term. Thackeray had said the saffron alliance will not approach the governor to stake claim for government formation without holding talks. Meanwhile, on Sunday, BJP rebel candidate from Mira-Bhayander Geeta Jain, who had defeated the official candidate Narendra Mehta in the assembly polls, met chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and declared her support to the party. Yuva Swabhiman Party MLA Ravi Rana and independent Rajendra Raut also gave 'unconditional' support to the BJP. Fadnavis has claimed that 15 rebels have already extended their support to BJP. At least five BJP rebels have been elected. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra assembly polls: Congress didn't put up serious fight, says Urdu press | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The Urdu press has said the Congress did not fight the assembly elections with the seriousness that its ally NCP showed. Urdu dailies, while lauding the good show put up by the Opposition, slammed the Congress for its ""lackadaisical approach"" in contesting the assembly polls. The Inquilab's editorial praised NCP president Sharad Pawar who, despite his age and enforcement directorate raids on his colleagues, extensively toured the state. His efforts paid off, commented the paper. It criticized the Congress for not fighting the elections seriously too. ""We regret that the Congress is losing the capacity to fight, which may cost it in future too. The situation (economic downturn) and people's disappointment with BJP are giving the Opposition, especially the Congress, enough opportunities to step up the fight but it is not showing the grit,"" it said.

"Maharashtra zilla parishad elections: BJP faces uphill task to win Dhule, Nandubar polls | Nashik News - Times of India","NASHIK: After Nashik, the BJP is again up against the Maha Vikas Aghadi in the zilla parishad elections in Dhule and Nandurbar. The voting for the 56 seats in each of the two ZPs took place on Tuesday with a voters’ turnout of nearly 65% both in Dhule and Nandurbar. In Dhule, BJP has put up candidates in all the 56 seats and the local unit exuded confidence that it would be able to defeat the combine Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP in the election. “In five seats, we have won uncontested as the opposition failed to put up candidates. We are confident that our party will win the ZP polls in Dhule,” Anup Agarwal, the district BJP president said. However, the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena combine is set to give BJP a run for its money. While Congress is contesting in 27 seats, NCP has put up candidates in 21 seats. Sena has put up candidates in the few of the remaining seats. Former Dhule city MLA Anil Gote, who joined NCP recently, said the united opposition would ensure that the anti-BJP votes do not get split. “The BJP camp should not rejoice as they won five seats uncontested. Our combine will come to power,” added Gote. In the tribal-dominated Nandurbar, BJP is locked in a direct contest with Congress in the ZP polls. Unlike Dhule, the Congress, Sena and NCP could not reach a pre-poll understanding here and all these parties are contesting the polls independently. Despite this, BJP insiders in Nandubar admitted that it would be difficult for the party to win the ZP polls. BJP is contesting all the 56 seats, while Congress has put up candidates in over 48 seats. Similarly NCP candidates are in fray in over 37 seats and Sena in 41 seats. “There is a pro Congress wave in many parts of the district as its legislator from Akkalkuwa, K C Padvi, has been made the tribal welfare minister in the new state government. We apprehend that it would help Congress win a majority in the seats,” said a BJP functionary from the district. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Sharad Pawar’s grandson calls Aaditya Thackeray with a friend request | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Rohit Pawar, the rising mass leader in NCP who won the Karjat-Jamkhed constituency in his electoral debut, has gone beyond political differences to offer a friendly handshake to his opponents. After winning his seat, Rohit, the grandson of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, immediately met his opponent Ram Shinde at his residence. On Friday, he called Shiv Sena candidate Aaditya Thackeray over the phone to congratulate him on his victory in Worli. During the phone call, both young politicians exchanged assurances that that they would cooperate with each other for the development and betterment of the state. This telephonic discussion between the two brought back memories of the friendship between the late Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, as they both got along well over various subjects beyond politics. “It is a good sign and I am happy about it if they are reviving the tradition. I would be happier if they would come together, closer beyond the politics, for the betterment of Maharashtra. Politics should be there only upto certain level but should work beyond politics while you (both) working towards creating a new Maharashtra and taking new generation ahead,” said Chandrakant Vaidya, brother-in-law of the Shiv Sena supremo who saw both Pawar and Thackeray closely. A political analyst, Prof Pramod Olekar, said the development was an example of “professional friendship”. “It is not pure friendship like that of their grandfathers, but could be professional friends. The second generation of Thackerays and Pawars, such as Uddhav, Ajit and Supriya continued the legacy of the seniors. However, for the third generation, Aaditya and Rohit, it is a professional matter.” Olekar said Sharad Pawar and Thackeray helped uplift people from the deprived communities and developed leadership, but the new generation was yet to match the standards set by them. Rohit, while talking to the media, said that he spoke to Aaditya and congratulated him after the poll results and assured him cooperation on the issues facing the state.

Maharashtra assembly elections: Election officials will not act against false affidavits | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Election officials will not take any responsibility for “false affidavits” as the onus is on candidates to declare all the details mandated by the Election Commission of India (ECI). “As per ECI guidelines, it is the duty of the candidate to file the required details. It is an affidavit and our job is to check whether all the details are filed and accept the application. We are not accountable for false affidavits,’’ state senior election officials. Sources in the election department said nominations are put out in public domain and citizens can file their complaints in court about them. The Supreme Court has observed that a contesting candidate must disclose not only case(s) in which charges have been framed but also case(s) in which cognizance has been taken by the competent court. The affidavits are uploaded on the ECI website and citizens can view them. If they have any issues, they can register their complaint in the court. Nearly 251 nominations have been received by the district election office. Activist Vijay Kumbhar said there should be a mechanism to check whether the details filed by the candidate are right. Many candidates from several assembly constituencies have filed their nominations without the AB form. “If they do not have the AB form, they will be treated as independent candidates even though they have mentioned the name of the party,” election authorities said.

Malshiras MLA Ram Satpute is cane harvester’s son and a Devendra Fadnavis find | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Son of a sugar cane harvester, Ram Satpute is the star of the moment, having defeated Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) heavyweight Uttam Jankar in the state assembly polls from Malshiras constituency in Solapur. His journey to the state politics, however, started four years ago when he won the confidence of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis after taking up issues of students of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and its affiliated colleges as a member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. Satpute is a native of Bhamburdi village in Malshiras — a highly drought-prone region. After completing his secondary education in Malshiras, he moved to Pune for graduation and postgraduation. He studied at the Pune Vidyarthi Gruha, during which his foundation as a student activist was laid. After joining the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), his efforts towards the welfare of students were noticed and he was soon made the vice-president of the BJP Yuva Morcha. Satpute had earned support from old-timer in the Malshiras constituency, Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil, and started his campaign after taking blessings of the family. His father worked with the Shankar Cooperative Sugar Factory between 1990 and 1995 and he decided to educate Satpute so that he does not have to work like him as sugar cane harvester, Satpute said. “After I completed my school education in Bhamburdi, my father sent me to Pune to do engineering. As I was studying in Pune, I realised that there were many students who had come from the rural parts of Maharashtra to study and were facing several issues. That’s when I began the student movement and joined the ABVP,” he said. From demanding better medical facilities at Savitribai Phule Pune University to protesting against result delays, Satpute led many agitations as ABVP member. He also helped students get aid from the chief minister’s fund. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Election Dates 2019: Election Commission to announce election dates for Maharashtra, Haryana today | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: With the Election Commission winding up preparatory discussions for state polls due next month, the announcement of assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana is expected any day now even as Jharkhand, where the assembly’s term ends on January 5 next year, will wait a little longer. BJP will seek re-election in Haryana and Maharashtra where, after its strong performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, it is the clear favourite. In Maharashtra, BJP is yet to finalise seat-sharing with ally Shiv Sena with which it has had a rocky relationship. However, while numbers prove elusive, the allies seem committed to contesting together even as rivals Congress and NCP have sealed their pre-poll pact. Apart from testing the fortunes of incumbent chief ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal, the polls are a serious challenge for opposition stalwarts Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Sharad Pawar, who have felt the weight of the BJP juggernaut in the 2019 elections with the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance winning 41 of the 48 seats and BJP sweeping all 10 in Haryana. Another mauling would be a harsh blow to their faltering careers. The large number of Congress and NCP leaders who have joined BJP and Sena, particularly several from Maratha political families, has bolstered the saffron alliance’s support in a community where it has usually lagged Congress and NCP. The opening shots for the state polls have been fired with PM Narendra Modi alleging that NCP boss Sharad Pawar has been “soft” on Pakistan and the latter accusing Modi of deliberate misinterpretation. In Haryana, BJP defends the full majority it won for the first time in 2014. The rival field seems splintered with Congress struggling to recover from factional feuds and the prominent Chautala family riven by factions. BSP, which can claim a degree of support in the state, has sealed and ditched a couple of alliances. Though BJP’s opponents are on the back foot, the state polls promise to be intensely contested, with regional and local issues expected to be keenly discussed. BJP is expected to raise ‘national’ issues like the Modi government’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, which it feels will play well to electoral audiences. Fadnavis and Manohar Lal have done well after being surprise picks in 2014, consolidating their positions and dealing with in-house and external rivals while maintaining relatively clean images. Hooda has managed to get the upper hand in the party unit and has patched up with critics like former minister Kumari Selja. He faces the difficult task of rallying a dispirited party, a problem that confronts Maharashtra Congress leaders too. Veteran Congress leaders like Harshvardhan Patil and Kripa Shankar Singh have jumped ship while NCP has lost several leaders include sitting MP Udayanraje Bhosle and Sachin Ahir. The terms of Haryana and Maharashtra assemblies end on November 2 and November 9 respectively. This is almost two months ahead of the deadline for expiry of Jharkhand assembly. Sources indicated that while the EC is likely to announce the poll schedule for Haryana and Maharashtra in the next couple of days, the poll bugle for Jharkhand may be sounded only in late October or early November. Even in 2014, while Haryana and Maharashtra polls were announced together on September 12, the announcement for Jharkhand and J&K had followed on October 25. J&K assembly was dissolved last year and the state has since been under governor’s rule followed by President’s rule. Chief election commissioner Sunil Arora had led an EC team to Maharashtra on Tuesday and Wednesday to review poll preparedness in the state. Earlier, senior commission officers had visited Haryana for a similar exercise. A significant number of central forces is likely to deployed for polls in the Naxal-affected Gadchiroli area. While Haryana government too had sought a large number of paramilitary forces, EC, citing their limited availability on account of large-scale deployment in J&K, convinced it to bring down the requirement.

So we brought him to the booth,"" said Sonal. Wheelchair-bound Zehra Bi, 83 and grandmother to 25, has never missed an election since Independence. ""I vote for you, so that your future can be bright,"" she said. In the absence of ramps, many senior citizens found it difficult to walk up to polling booths.

But Parvathi Seshanandan (95), who was accompanied by her neighbour to the polling booth in Matunga, found the arrangements this time were much better. The election officials at Gawanpada municipal school in Mulund East got a pandal erected outside the school to serve as a booth for senior citizens and the physically challenged so that they did not have to climb to the first floor. Ulhasnagar witnessed a lower voter turnout, but senior citizens came out in force to vote.  A few senior citizens were hassled as they could not find their names on the voter list.

It also ran an outreach exercise that identified voters with disabilities and reached out to them, days in advance, enquiring whether they needed help to reach the polling stations. “We sent taxis or hydraulic buses to people who sought help and ferried them to the polling booths,” said Mamata Shere, nodal officer overseeing facilities for voters with physical disabilities. The government had also launched an app so that people with disabilities could register and seek assistance. Every polling booth had a wheelchair and dedicated personnel to operate it, she said.

"Barring 3 seats, poll turnout dips in Mumbai's minority pockets | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Voting percentages in several of Mumbai's 10-odd constituencies with Muslim concentrations were lower than the city's average turnout of 50.5%. Overall, 14 of the city's 36 assembly constituencies had lower-than-average turnouts, the bulk of which have large Muslim pockets. Nevertheless, two seats with Muslim-majority populations, Chandivli and Anushakti Nagar, registered not only above-average turnouts, but also vastly improved their voting percentages over the 2014 state assembly elections. In Chandivli, where Congress's four-time MLA and former cabinet minister Naseem Khan contested against Shiv Sena's Dilip Lande, a huge turnout jump was registered, with 52.3% of the electorate exercising their franchise this time as compared to 44.3% in the 2014 assembly polls. In Anushakti Nagar, the corresponding figures were 55.3% and 46.7%. The other constituencies with Muslim dominance or concentration are Mankhurd, Mumbadevi, Byculla, Dharavi, Goregaon, Versova, Bandra West, Andheri West and Colaba. In Mankhurd, too, turnout rose substantially, from 41.3% in 2014 to 44.8% this time, though it remained lower than the city average. The seat has been bagged twice by Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi, who contested from the constituency a third time. In most of the other seats with Muslim concentrations, turnouts were much lower than in 2014 and also the 2019 city average. On Chandivli, sitting MLA Naseem Khan, a prominent face in state politics, told TOI, ""People have supported and voted for me since they know my work. We have 365 days of connectivity with our voters. In our constituency, we work for everyone, for all communities. Our constituency also maintains communal harmony, as we work for the redevelopment of places of worship belonging to all religions."" For the drop in turnout in the other three Muslim-dominated constituencies, community leaders blamed voters' apathy and confusion over multiple candidates. They said the community's lack of interest in the voting process was worrying as turnout remained low despite sustained campaigns.  Congress leader Mudassar Patel said many Muslims were discouraged to go out to vote due to the presence of multiple candidates from the community in many of the constituencies. ""Take Mumbadevi, which has a substantial Muslim population. There, Bashir Patel of MIM was pitted against sitting MLA Amin Patel. This may have discouraged many from voting (because of a lack of a united front),"" said Mudassar. Amin Patel, who was ranked as the best-performing Mumbai MLA by NGO Praja Foundation for three consecutive years, won the seat twice, 2009 and 2014, on a Congress ticket. This time, his MIM rival is believed to have robbed him of a chunk of votes.  Activist Farid Khan said Muslims are yet to realize the importance of votes. For the low turnout from the community, he also blamed a lack of a good choice of candidates in some of the constituencies. He especially cited the example of Byculla, where MIM legislator Waris Pathan sought re-election. SP leader Rais Shaikh, who was originally supposed to contest from the seat, was sent to Bhiwandi East because of an arrangement with the Congress, which later broke down. But by then, Rais couldn't return to Byculla. ""Many of his supporters were unhappy at him being made to shift to Bhiwandi and didn't show any enthusiasm in voting on Monday,"" said Khan.

At Mount Mary Convent High School, Class IX student Samya Shaikh and her classmate Saraswati Kamath came to the poling centre to help the elderly from 7 am. Chrisya Nunes (20) had stationed herself at Anjuman Islam School in Khairani Road, Saki Naka, since 6 am. ""A few more of my friends were supposed to join but they didn't get alloted this centre so I am all alone here,"" said the student of Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Kurla. She was tired by noon but said she was determined to be there till 6 pm. At Yojna College in Borivli, there were 16-year-olds from the institution as well as 19-year-olds from the NSS team of Thakur College. ""We would have liked to vote for the first time but our election card hasn't come yet,"" a student of voting age said. Hemant Kadam (14) of Mahatma Gandhi Vidya Mandir in Bandra helped an 86-year-old woman at the Navjeevan Vidya Mandir, where the Thackeray family voted.

"Maharashtra assembly polls 2019: Aarey steps out in force, yet Jogeshwari turnout lower | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The polling percentage at Jogeshwari (east), the constituency that houses the metro car shed site in Aarey Colony, dropped by 3% in the assembly polls held on Monday. Activists believe that anger against the government over the felling of trees kept many away from the booths, but political leaders called it an insignificant dip. Barring glitches lasting for 15-25 minutes in the EVM and VVPAT machines of a few booths, all four centres inside Aarey saw a good turnout. The polling station at Picnic Point that faces the metro site barricades had recorded nearly 45% voting by 3pm. In areas called units 7 and 5, the percentage had crossed 50% by 4pm. All booths saw heavy police deployment. Civil engineering student Mahadev Ghodke, who lives in unit 30, said his family and many in the neighbourhood had planned to boycott. But on Monday, the 22-year-old stepped out with his mother and sister to vote. “We thought if we can’t stop them, we should at least elect someone who will listen to us,” he said. Aarey has around 30,000 out of the constituency’s 2.8 lakh voters. Compared to 2014’s polling percentage of 55.5%, it dipped to 52.9% on Monday. Shiv Sena sitting MLA Ravindra Waikar blamed it on slow voting machines and the 7-11-second wait for VVPAT slips. “People lose patience. Aarey or any other issue didn’t play any role,” he said. But Vitthal Lad from Aam Aadmi Party said people didn’t vote out of anger. “People’s voices are not heard. The government is doing what it chooses to,” he said. Anusuya Dutta Gaikwad from Matepada in Aarey said she voted to ensure the government was “taught a lesson”. “They think people are fools. They oppose the tree-cutting while shaking hands with the same government. Who do we trust? Many are upset and parties like Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi could gain,” she said. But Royal Palms resident Anudeep Sapaliga doesn’t think Aarey was a poll issue. “Encroachment of the Aarey forest or the pathetic condition of roads is a much bigger issue for people living here. Even for locals, water and sanitation are prime concerns. Everyone wants good connectivity,” he said. Naval Goradia said he had moved from Kandivli to Royal Palms for his father, who suffered from a heart disease but showed a great recovery after shifting to Aarey five years ago. “Nobody wants to lose the green cover. But Aarey is losing much more to encroachment. The air is getting polluted because of heavy vehicle movement and traffic snarls,” he added. Many Aarey crusaders pressed the NOTA button, but some voted so that their voices wouldn’t be drowned. “Many have voted against the government. I chose against NOTA so that we can elect a party and hold it responsible,” said Tasneem Shaikh of Aarey Conservation group. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Hassle-free voting thanks to creches | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Crèches were a hit at several polling centres in the suburbs. At some polling centres, though, they were not visible enough and, hence, did not find takers. Two anganwadi staff at each centre kept the children occupied, offering them toys and books. There was even a swing bed for infants. Jyoti Shirke and her husband Naresh said the crèche was a boon. The family, which has recently shifted to Vasai, had to come to Borivali West to cast their vote and didn’t know where to leave their nine-year-old daughter. Thanks to the facility, the bank employees said the half hour wait was smooth. Elsewhere in the city, too, the EC’s initiative drew praise. “When I went to pick up my four-year-old daughter from the crèche, she was reluctant to leave as she was having a good time,” said Shivangi Patil at the Worli Seaface polling booth. But Supriya Soga, who was on duty at the crèche at St. Anne’s High School polling centre in Pali Hill, said she had no kids to care for.

Maharashtra assembly: Poll booths on grounds in soggy mess after weekend rain | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The sudden showers prior to D-day led to a mess. Literally. The many open grounds on which polling booths had been set up at several places across the city were rain-washed and mucky on Monday when people walked in to cast their vote. The Election Commission had decided to set up polling booths on open grounds just so that voters, especially the elderly and physically challenged, did not have to climb staircases. The plan went awry as rain over the weekend played spoilsport. At the Supari Tank Municipal School on St Sebastian Road in Bandra (west), many booths had been set up on the school ground. On Monday morning, the ground was dotted with puddles full of muddy water, leaving little or no pathway for people to walk. An election official on duty at the site said that a pathway was carved out by municipal employees in a matter of a few hours so that voters could negotiate the rain-washed ground. ""They used drain covers and cement to lay out a temporary pathway early Monday morning before the voting process began,"" said the official. ""It only helped that it did not rain today [Monday]."" Senior citizen, Yasmin Mussa, a Bandra resident, who had come to vote had to wade through the mucky ground. But that did not deter her from casting her vote, as Mussa walked in with a stick for support. A similar soggy ground was seen at St Stanislaus School which was also a polling centre. Officially, the monsoon has withdrawn, according to Met officials.The drizzle over the weekend were ""post-monsoon showers"". On Monday, the city witnessed light rain. The observatory in the city recorded 0.2 mm of rainfall while the suburbs recorded no rainfall. At the polling booths, elderly persons and the differently abled were offered assistance to get to the booths, said the official. ""We ensured that they did not have to wade through muck anywhere."" Elsewhere, in Dharavi, Shahu Nagar, Mulund and Borivli (east), it was a somewhat similar story. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Colaba witnesses lowest polling among all 288 seats in Maharashtra | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Colaba recorded the lowest turnout at 40.2% among all 288 constituencies in the state. At 47.2%, the other south Mumbai locality of Malabar Hill, too, saw a much lower voter turnout than in the recent Lok Sabha election. Officials blaned voter apathy for the poor numbers. District election officer Shivaji Jondhale said the recent general elections had seen 50% and 56% voting in Colaba and Malabar Hill, respectively, which fell by roughly 10% in the assembly polls. He said the areas are dominated by top corporate executives and businessmen for whom state-level issues matter little. “Income tax, corporate tax and central policies are closer to their hearts,” he said. In the 2014 assembly election, Colaba had registered 46.1% and Malabar Hill 52.5% voter turnout —5-6% more than in the current polls. At the two Kendriya Vidyalaya polling stations in Colaba, voter turnout ranged from 0.1% to to 2%. A election official said barely 14 of the 1,000 voters turned up at one of the Kendriya Vidyalaya schools. At an Army Public School booth near R C Church, out of 233 voters only eight cast their vote or just 3.5%. The municipal school inside Colaba market registered 35% voting by 5.30pm.  Kemps Corner, Pedder Road, Walkeshwar, Banganga, Colaba market and Navy Nagar registered an average of 30% voting by 3pm and the polling booths wore a deserted look post noon. At Activity Infant School off Pedder Road, where prominent voters such as chief secretary Ajoy Mehta and HDFC chairman Dilip Parekh voted, the overall percentage touched 35% by 4.30pm. At 3pm, the Walkeshwar Banganga Municipal school saw just 32% voting. A few people, mainly the youth, complained their names were not registered despite submitting applications twice. BJP corporator Jyotsna Mehta was unhappy with the initial response of voters and was seen working hard to ensure maximum voting. At Villa Theresa High School near Kemps Corner, election officers complained youth were not turning up in sizable numbers. Lack of parking saw many leave without voting.

Conceptualised in 2009 by the Election Commission to woo women voters, the 28 special booths across the city stood out with their pink decor and balloons.  The Sakhi booths in the suburbs handed women a bottle of kokum sharbat and a cloth bag. Men were only given the beverage.  At the Sakhi booth at Varsha Nagar Municipal School in Ghatkopar (West), the zonal officer organised a block printing workshop for women voters which drew over 1,000 women. Sandhya Nalawade, zonal officer from the booth, said word-of-mouth publicity did the trick, ensuring a nearly 50% turnout till 4 pm.  However, the Sakhi booths are yet to show the desired results. ""For every 1,000 male voters in 2014, there were 816 female voters. That number has jumped to 835 in 2019 for Mumbai city.

Maharashtra assembly polls: India Inc keeps its date with both EVM and office PC | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Monday was declared a holiday by the state government to enable citizens to cast their vote, but several Mumbaikars slogged it out at work as well. A Goregaon resident made it to her voting centre at Gokuldam minutes before the gates were to close. “My office had given the option of taking some off time either during the first or the second half of the day for voting. I thought I wouldn’t be able to make it but soon as I learnt that voting was allowed till 6 pm, I made a dash for it,” said the employee of a real estate company, adding that she had never missed voting even once since she started in 2014. A communications official from a diversified firm exercised his franchise and went to work, saying that though his employers had declared a holiday he had to attend to some urgent business. Following the state government order to keep factories and other establishments closed, most organisations, including head offices of large corporates like Tata Sons, Mahindra & Mahindra and Hindustan Unilever, remained shut on Monday. The order was applicable to all establishments, both under private and government sectors, and included residential hotels, eating houses, other shops, cinema theatres, companies, malls and retail outlets, among others. Labour law consultants had advised companies to comply with the order, as failure to do so might invite action. Most companies said they were notified last week by their employee relations departments about the holiday. Many gave employees the flexibility to take a couple of hours off for voting. As Diwali is near, retail outlets and some kirana stores, too, remained only partially closed. Given the financial results season, board meetings were held where the schedule had been decided prior to the notification. An official from a corporate said they had “made appropriate arrangements to enable people to exercise their voting right”. “Factories operate as a continuous process and these cannot be closed down. There will always be somebody at the shop floor. Similarly, customer service cannot stop. Companies have always encouraged employees to vote and they have made sure they are offered the flexibility to do so,” an HR head said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Some had filled forms in 2015 but their voter I-cards have still not reached them,"" a booth officer said. Danny Fernandes of Aram Nagar had been unable to vote in the LS polls either. Vivek Singh from Ghatkopar East went to multiple centres in vain. ""I went to Guru Nanak School because that is my polling centre, but the officials sent me to another school. There, too, I could not find it. I looked up my name online and it confirmed Guru Nanak School. Finally I did not vote,"" he said. In such cases, booth staff could do little except direct people to higher authorities. Chief electoral officer Baldev Singh said there were not many complaints. This time when the summary list was being finalised, political parties were asked to send their representatives to ensure the exercise was error-free. ""I received feedback from collectors statewide to say that they did not receive a single complaint of missing names in their area,"" Singh said. In Ulhasnagar, businessman Ashok Kukreja said six of his family could not vote. ""We voted in the LS poll but now our names were dropped,"" Mehta said.

Since 7am, both young and old were seen flocking to polling booths and by evening, the crowds surged. Among the polling centres that were packed with voters was Adarsh Vidyalaya Compound, where 35-50 voters were seen standing in queues. ""A large number of voters are either Shiv Sena or NCP supporters.

Local activist Kiran Pawar said, ""During the poll campaigns, several traders and businessmen pledged support to the candidates. Despite GST and other issues, they decided not boycott elections or opt for NOTA."" Shiv Sena sitting MLA Ashok Patil did not get a ticket, but he decided not to rebel, which worked in favour of the party as Patil is popular among a large section of voters.

Congress candidate Suresh Koparkar too went all out this time, to draw out not just Muslim voters in Sonapur, but also those in highrises and slums. MNS candidate Sandeep Jalgaonkar too campaigned hard to bring out more Marathi voters. The constituency has more than 70% Marathi-speaking population and sources indicate that they have been instrumental in the huge turnout during every election.

Maharashtra assembly elections: A long march for women candidates | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The percentage of women candidates in the state assembly elections has stubbornly stayed in single digits over the years, but has been inching up in the last four polls. This year, of the 3,237 candidates in the fray, 235 or 7.3% are women candidates. This is the highest percentage ever, and there is at least one woman candidate in 152 of the 288 assembly constituencies. Six constituencies boast of as many as four women candidates each — the highest — in the state. The state has reserved 50% seats in local bodies for women, but this reservation does not apply to assembly elections. In 1972, there was not a single woman MLA in Maharashtra. Of the 56 women who contested, not one won. The situation is changing, but women leaders in parties who demand increased representation often find that besides patriarchal notions, the issue of winnability is a hurdle. “Gender bias is still rooted in the system. A large number of women nominees who have been given tickets this time are from political families. Very few local women get a ticket,” said a woman politician from BJP. She added that parties talk about winnability, but how can women prove their draw if they don’t get to contest. The lack of women candidates sticks out as over the years, the number of women candidates has been going up; women's voting percentage too is on upswing. Of the 8.97 crore voters in the state, almost half (4.38 crore) are women. “It is sad there are so few women candidates for a voter base that is almost as numerous as men. Women’s representation is required for raising women-related issues, which don’t happen a lot,” said Parineeta Patil, an activist. A senior woman politician said a large number of women voters in rural areas do not vote on their own and are generally influenced by the husband or father. “Till the time women make their own choice and demand better representation, things will not change,” she said.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Climate change, health care, education and jobs top priority for youth | Nagpur News - Times of India","Youngsters are flag bearers of change but their voices often go unheard when they comment on the political climate in the country. They can still make a difference by exercising their franchise to elect the right government. TOI spoke to youngsters in the city to find out about their expectations from the new government ahead of the assembly polls. The main emphasis was on climate change, education, sanitation, women’s safety and job creation. Talking about the water supply problems and not-so-effective plantation drives, Shiny Philip, a law student, said, “I want the government to focus more on afforestation as well as proper drinking water supply to more than 47,000 villages in Maharashtra.” Job opportunities will always be a big issue for the youth. With the tool of social media at their disposal, today they are more aware about what they exactly want from their leaders. “I want the state government to improve the quality of education, provide good health care facilities to the downtrodden, encourage manufacture of eco-friendly products and develop connectivity to rural areas. The thermal power plants around Nagpur and Chandrapur are damaging the environment, so the government should explore some sources of renewal energy,” said Rushikesh Kalkar, an engineer. On the education front, the city has well-known engineering and medical colleges but lacks good coaching centres for competitive exams. “Government should take the initiative for encouraging quality coaching for professional exams like company secretary, chartered accountants, MPSC, UPSC, IAS exams. This will be beneficial for youth in terms of cost and time as they will not have to shift to bigger cities for coaching,” said Pooja Hisariya, CS student. Shivani Kathane, another student, says the government should spread more awareness about its schemes. “A lot of paper work is still done at government offices and officials do not cooperate to redress grievances of citizens. This despite the stress on making India digital,” said Shivani. There are some like student Srujal Randive who want a massive change in sanitation and basic facilities. “I would like to see the government working for better health care and sanitation, and bringing down inflation. “We need good roads and better infrastructure facilities and not grand statues,” said Srujal. The focus should also be on providing basic amenities to slum dwellers, besides caring for stray animals, said Ruchikar Asatkar, a lifestyle blogger. “The government should build shelters for poor people and stray animals.

Maharashtra assembly elections: Hadapsar constituency analysis | Pune News - Times of India,"A lot has happened in Hadapsar. Since the delimitation of constituencies in Pune in 2009, this assembly segment has gone on to bring IT parks, large housing societies, multiplexes and even parts of Pune Cantonment under its purview. It has, truly, ballooned. Today, the Hadapsar assembly constituency spans the Katraj-Santoshnagar areas; Salunkhe Vihar; Kondhwa; Wanowrie; Fatimanagar; Mohammedwadi; Keshavnagar; Mundhwa and Magarpatta. If you have recently moved to Pune, chances are you will either work here, or live here. To handle this growing urban bustle, the Hadapsar constituency has been assigned many transportation projects — an elevated Metro line, the High Capacity Mass Transit Road and a revamped rail terminus, which is being proposed as a satellite facility that, once complete, will ease the burden on the existing Pune railway station. But residents said an administration focused on transportation projects has ignored two key problems of the constituency — its appalling civic hygiene and water shortages. “We live in a dirty and unhygienic place. There is no system for garbage collection or disposal. The whole open area near Samvidhan Chowk is nothing but a large landfill,” said Tarun Dixit, a resident of Kedarinagar. Hadapsar’s garbage issue has been piling for a few years now. Proposals for a second garbage processing plant at Ramtekdi have been stuck in political deadlock with the opposition maintaining that the second installation will only cause large amounts of waste to be diverted to one area for processing. But MLA Yogesh Tilekar said he is confident the new plant will be able to handle the additional load. “I’m aware of the garbage problems here. I plan to start a new plant, which will process nearly 1,000 tonnes of garbage. The existing units are not working to full capacity.” However, it’s on drinking water supply that Tilekar has truly struggled to make inroads. Several hundred housing societies across the Hadapsar constituency today rely solely on water tankers. In many areas, charges for a single tanker are as high as Rs 900, with many apartments buying as many as five tankers even during days of heavy rain. “The administration has not paid any heed to this crisis. Our housing society comes within the PMC, but there is no water connection. We have to depend on water tankers,” said Puneet Mehta, a resident of the Palace Orchard Cooperative Housing Society, along the NIBM-Undri road. “One solution that was offered was the reduction of the gradient on Undri Road.” Tilekar said he has been working to ensure adequate water for all within his constituency. “We have to increase water storage capacity here. Unless we have sufficient storage, we will not be able to supply many areas — including, NIBM Road, Undri, Hadapsar and Manjri. I’ve had talks with the chief minister on this matter. As part of the 24x7 water supply project, I built 13 water storage tanks. At many places, the work is still on. How will we have water unless the tanks are built?” he told TOI. But residents said the administration should have tapped into Pune’s generous monsoon, a more sustainable and long-term option, instead of pinning hopes on a multi-crore project. “We should have started saving rainwater long ago. All new constructions in Hadapsar should have had rainwater harvesting systems. What we have today is a network of flyovers and concrete roads that don't allow rainwater to percolate. This is not long-term thinking, which is an MLA’s job,” said Paul Cyriac, a resident of Mundhwa. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"'No water, no vote' protest on NIBM Road | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Over 15 societies, part of the NIBM Road Residents Forum, have decided to boycott the assembly elections unless they are assured of adequate water supply.  The residents of the societies - numbering around 3,000 - said they have been facing the problem of water shortage for the past 15 years and are completely dependent on tankers.  One member,YK Gupta, told TOI they had written to the local authority and the chief minister about their plight, but their problem has not been addressed. ""No water, no vote will be our stand till we get assurance from the authorities,"" said Gupta.  Members said that in 2015, political leaders in presence of city representatives, laid a foundation stone for a pipeline from Fakhri Hills to Sunshree Supreme Green Woods CHS. But the project could not be completed due to difficulties in laying lines through defence land near Lulla Nagar crossing.

Maharashtra elections: Stall owners cash in on pre-election chai pe kharcha | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: A classic piece of Mumbai pantomime played out this Friday when MNS candidate Avinash Jadhav emerged from his bustling party office in Thane at a searing 2.30 pm. Even as he was talking on the phone, Jadhav crinkled his eyes in the direction of shopkeeper Rajesh Rahate and then compressed the air with his index finger and thumb. Sure enough, within seconds, a tiny conical white tea cup--brimming with sweet, buffalo-milk-based, ""non-acidic"" Pandharpur-style chai--landed in the MLA's free hand. ""He (Jadhav) drops in at least five to six times a day,"" said a suddenly-reverential Rahate, whose month-old tea shop adjacent to the MNS office has not only been making close to Rs 7,000 instead of the standard daily average of Rs 6,000 the last few days but also has already won a VIP ambassador in Jadhav, who often recommends the Rs-10-per-glass homegrown beverage to others. As pairs of dull footwear multiply outside party offices in the run-up to the Vidhan Sabha elections, chai is flowing as generously as charchas across the city. For chaiwallas and stall owners in the radius of outposts, this election fizz is making up for the festive lull between Navratri and Diwali. Among those celebrating is a tea stall owner inside Manohar Bhonsle's 37-year-old vada pao centre near Dadar's Shiv Sena Bhavan which famously binds estranged cousins and political rivals Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray in their gastronomical love of the working class snack. ""Every time there's a meeting, our business booms,"" said Lalji Patel, who runs the tea stall that dispatches around 70 cups of the Rs 10-worth hot milky beverage a day. ""Just yesterday,"" he added, ""I made 50 per cent more than what I make on a regular day."" While PM Narendra Modi's chaiwalla-to-prime-minister narrative has infused chai with political stardust of late, the beverage has long been the preferred fuel of the swarms of men in Modi jackets and all-whites looking to sustain themselves through endless meetings. Last year, in fact, an RTI reply alluded to this when it showed that the money spent on tea in CM Devedra Fadnavis' office had jumped by Rs 2 crore within a year, leading the Congress to allege a 'chai scam'. Many major party offices now boast their own coffee machines, pantries and contractual chai suppliers which means the neighbourhood chaiwalla is not being patronised as much by the pre-election all-white armies. ""Why would people prefer to have chai here when they get their tea inside for free?"" asked Mahesh, a no-nonsense chaiwalla opposite the NCP office in Ballard Pier. Then, there's the other problem peculiar to the Vidhan Sabha elections. ""Candidates are outside the city on rallies and the meetings are mostly done with. So, not many party workers come for chai or snacks,"" said a clerk at the Janta Dal political party office at Nariman Point which has offered the front portion of its premises to a 20-year-old tea and snacks stall. ""In fact, if you come on a Sunday, when our office is shut, this place is dead silent,"" the official added. The proximity to political hotspots pays in other ways though. When the BMC and the cops play villains, regularly fining chaiwallas or whisking away their equipment, party workers come to the rescue. ""The pheriwallas have to pay a hefty fine. Still they return to the spot, buy new equipment and go on. Where will they go? So we help them, "" says an official at a party office in Nariman Point, who recently made a case for a fruit seller hailing from Kolhapur at the Marine Drive police station. Typically, the men running the stalls outside party offices tend to be party workers. Some are even known to have the aura of secret keepers while others can brag about having entered the hearts of VIPs through the stomach. Sixty-two-year-old Manohar Bhonsle--whose vada pav stall in Dadar was born out of street food politics in 1982, a time when the Shiv Sena was trying to instil pride in the Marathi manoos through this home-grown burger--recalled that his seed capital had come from Raj Thackeray who had spotted his potato patties sizzling in a kadai perched precariously on a tiny table by the roadside. “He called for me and handed me Rs 15,000 so that I could set up a proper shop,” recalled Bhonsle, who attributes the popularity of his vadapaos to the ""magic"" in the hands of his wife who wakes up at 6 to pound the fiery, gavti-dhania-infused mix that lends the ""military batatas"" their fire. These days, while Uddhav Thackeray makes a customary pitstop at his kiosk for tea and bhajji on the way to a nearby temple, Raj Thackeray prefers to get his usual portion of vada pav packed for himself and his mother, and moong bhajji for his sister. Bhonsle's backdrop though is less a poster and more a billboard, that shows various stages of shaking hands and handing over flowers to Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray. It was Manohar Bhonsle's VIP namesake and his biggest vada pao fan, Manohar Joshi, who introduced the stall owner to Bal Thackeray on his birthday at the Sena Bhavan many years ago. ""I was tongue-tied,” recalled Bhonsle. If not for some unforeseen formatting that his laptop recently underwent, Neeraj Joshi, one of the many men in yellow running errands such as offering chai and sweets in the bustling BJP party office at Nariman Point, too would have shown you similar photos with everyone from Devendra Fadnavis to Yogi Adityanath. With those wiped out, all Joshi--who used to prepare chai for BJP politicians before he became an errand boy and who learnt the art from his grandfather--has now are memories. ""I even saw Amit Shah when he was the BJP president in 2014,"" said Joshi, who recalled fetching Shah a glass of milk with less sugar. Some chaiwallas, though, are estranged political neighbours. ""The leaders are fine but the men working under them never pay us. They have drowned my money many times,"" said Madan, a chaiwalla in Thane who has stopped serving the party office near him, does not have a local voting card and caters only to scrupulous office-goers instead. Dadar's Patel, on the other hand, senses that his political clients are not as close-fisted as they used to be. ""There's less dadagiri now,"" he said. ""Maybe because the PM is one of us.""

Maharashtra elections: Poll paraphernalia business hit by online canvassing | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The Murudkar Zendewale & Phetewale store has been selling election merchandise, such as party flags, turbans and caps, from their Budhwar Peth outlet for decades now. But the third-generation management of the iconic store says the run-up to the October 21 battle of ballots is turning out to be a dry spell, like never before. ""The sales have gone down by nearly 10% to 20% this election. The Election Commission (EC) continues to increase the stringency of model code of conduct imposed every election season. This has affected our business,"" said Girish Murudkar, owner of the store. Despite the odds, however, Murudkar said his strong research and development (R&D) department comes up with unique designs each year, to ensure that a demand is created. “The idea is to cater to those who cannot make bulk purchases. Those buying limited amounts would be better placed at spending more money for better quality products. This is where we come in. For instance, if earlier somebody wanted to buy 5,000 simple flags, they are now buying 500 designer ones. We charge more for the designer materials and this is how we ensure our business stays profitable,” Murudkar said. Besides the Phule-style turban, popularized by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, a range of items donning the party symbol for Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), including turbans, caps and scarves, has also been newly introduced in his shop during this election season. “Pawar has been encouraging the use of turban donned by Mahatama Phule during his time. So we came with the similar style with NCP party symbols on it, and their demand has been soaring since.The VBA merchandise has also been well-received,” Murudkar said. Murudkar cited the popularity of the social media among the candidates for campaigning a reason for dip in the business. “During the last state election, there was hardly any place in the shop for the customers to come and stand. This time around, with political parties making the use of social media for campaigning and publicity, our sales have taken a hit.” He said the limited expenditure by political parties was also having an affect on the sales. “I am still positive. Election merchandise will always remain popular. Even with the decreased demand, there would be always some takers for new designs. We still receive orders from all across India, because our customers want something unique. Right now, our principal buyers are from Maharashtra and Haryana,” Murudkar added.

Maharashtra government formation: Latest developments | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI:The ShivSena on Monday was racing against time to cobble together an alliance to form a government in Maharashtra, with the Congress and the NCP mulling extending their support to the right-wing party. Here are the latest developments: * Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray met NCP president Sharad Pawar in Mumbai on Monday, sources said. The Sena chief was accompanied by his son Aaditya Thackeray as he called on Pawar at an undisclosed location, they said. * With the deadlock over government formation continuing in Maharashtra, NCP leader Nawab Malik on Monday said it is the responsibility of ""all of us"" to give an alternative considering the plight of people in the state. Malik, however, said the NCP will take any decision in consensus with its ally Congress. ""Announcement on support will be made only after Congress meet at 4pm,"" NCP's Nawab Malik said after the party leaders held a meeting with its chief Sharad Pawar. * The Congress party held a Congress Working Committee meeting to decide on whether to support the Shiv Sena in forming the government in Maharashtra, at party's interim president Sonia Gandhi's residence in New Delhi. ""We have called our Maharashtra leaders to Delhi for further discussions, the meeting will be at 4pm,"" senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said. * Shiv Sena MP coming down harshly on the BJP on Monday said that the BJP is insulting the people of Maharshtra. ""They are willing to sit in the opposition, but are reluctant to follow the 50-50 formula, for which they agreed before polls,"" he said. He also said that when the BJP could tie-up with the PDP to form government in the then Jammu and Kashmir state, why the Sena could not do the same with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra. * Reaching out to the opposition parties, he said the Congress and NCP should bury their internal differences to come up with a 'common minimum programme' in the interest of Maharashtra. ""The Sena, NCP and Congress agree on protecting the interest of Maharashtra,"" the Shiv Sena MP said. * As the NCP and Shiv Sena showed signs of a potential alliance to form government in Maharashtra, Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam on Monday said that the political instability in the state cannot be ruled out. The Congress leader also asserted that early elections are likely in Maharashtra and raised a question on contesting future polls with Shiv Sena as a partner. * Earlier today, Union heavy industries minister and Shiv Sena leader Arvind Sawant announced his decision to quit the NDA government at the Centre. The party's lone minister in the Modi Cabinet took to Twitter to announce his decision, a day after the NCP had said that it would back the Shiv Sena on a condition that the latter party severs its ties with ally BJP. * Reacting to the resignation of Sawant, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said that he had not talked to anyone regarding any resgination. ""We will have a word with Congress today. Whatever decision is to be taken will be taken only after discussions with Congress,"" he said. * Pawar will a chair party's core group meeting today to discuss the political situation in the state after BJP on Sunday despite being the single largest party expressed its inability to form the government in Maharashtra.

NCP leader Nawab Malik had on Sunday said the Shiv Sena will have to severe its all relations with the BJP to get the support of his party in forming the government in the state. * Meanwhile, the Maharashtra BJP core committee headed by caretaker chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will also meet in Mumbai today. * The BJP on Sunday announced that it would not form government in Maharashtra in view of the ally Shiv Sena's stand to not join them in the efforts. Announcing the BJP's decision, Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil accused the Uddhav Thackeray-led party, which is adamant on its demand for a rotational chief ministership, of ""disrespecting"" the popular mandate secured by the BJP and the Sena in recent assembly polls. * Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Khoshyari on Sunday night asked the Shiv Sena to ""indicate the willingness and ability"" of the party to stake claim, mounting suspense over formation of government. After the governor's communication, newly-elected Sena MLAs, staying at a suburban hotel in Mumbai, went into a huddle. They later moved to Matoshree, the Bandra residence of the party chief Uddhav Thackeray, for another meeting. * Sharing of power, especially the post of the chief minister on a rotational basis, has been the bone of contention between the Sena and the BJP which has resulted into a deadlock. * In the October 21 state polls, the BJP won 105 seats while the Shiv Sena bagged 56 seats. Besides, the NCP got 54 seats and the Congress 44. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Maharashtra elections 2019: Amit Shah predicts wipeout for Congress-NCP in Maharashtra | India News - Times of India,"SHIRUR: After offering prayers at Ambabai temple in Kolhapur and as chants of ‘Jai Bhawani-Jai Shivaji’ rent the air, home minister Amit Shah sets off on another round of campaigning for the Maharashtra elections, predicting that the end of opposition NCP-Congress is near. Shah exudes confidence that BJP will maintain its winning streak and Devendra Fadnavis will return for a second term as CM as he recalled the “misrule” during the Congress-NCP alliance government and looks to emphasise his party’s nationalist credentials. Addressing a rally in Karad, Shah questioned Congress’s apprehensions about steps taken by the Modi government on national security: “There could not be a bigger irony that the Congress did nothing for national security and when Modi government is taking measures, the opposition party is questioning them,” Shah said, getting a round of applause from the crowd. Though this is a state poll, national issues have figured prominently in speeches with ruling party frequently underlining the decisive and firm leadership of Prime Minister and steps taken by his government like the nullification of Article 370 and Article 35A subsequent to the resounding verdict in Modi’s favour in the Lok Sabha polls. Amit Shah indisposed, skips poll rallies in Haryana“BJP won more than 300 seats in the recent Lok Sabha polls after which Prime Minister Modi removed Article 370 and incorporated Kashmir with the country’s mainstream,” Shah said at Kolhapur. In Shirur assembly constituency of Pune district Shah was on a roadshow, the first in the current Maharashtra polls. During the roadshow, Republican Party flags were seen with the BJP, but not that of ally Shiv Sena. BJP and Sena are contesting the polls as allies but the ongoing campaign has seen the two treading cautiously with the regional ally appearing wary after being forced to play second fiddle bagging lesser seats in the seat sharing arrangements. Sena has already come out with its own manifesto and BJP is likely to release its own soon. In campaigns, posters and banners, the two allies are rarely mentioned together. Shah, however, spoke of the strength of the alliance drawing a comparison between contestants spearheading the challenge. “There are two options for people of Maharashtra; On the one hand there are Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray and on the other side are Rahul Baba and Sharad Pawar. People of the state have to choose between them!” Shah says. The BJP chief attacked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying, “Through air strike, PM Modi destroyed terror camps and killed terrorists but Rahul Gandhi accused PM of “khoon ki dalali”. Urging people to vote for BJP, Shah said the “double-decker” governments (Centre and state) have already delivered for the state and another mandate was needed to maintain the momentum.

Nashik picks three women MLAs from 4 constituencies | Nashik News - Times of India,"NASHIK: Voters in the four constituencies — three in city and Devlali on the outskirts — have reposed their faith in women by electing three women MLAs. The 2019 assembly elections saw Devyani Pharande and Seema Hiray – both from BJP — retaining their seats in Nashik Central and Nashik West, respectively. Meanwhile, voters in the Devlali assembly segment, which includes parts of Nashik Road within the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) limits along with rural areas, chose Saroj Ahire of NCP to represent them in the state assembly. “The best thing that Nashik residents have done is hand over power to women — all of whom had contested from general seats,” said Sanket Shinde, an engineer who runs his own business. Nashik had recently carried out various electoral experiments. While the voters here handed over the reins of the city to three Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) candidates in the 2009 assembly elections, they ousted the sitting MLAs to bring in three BJP candidates in 2014. In the 2019 Lok Sabha general elections, Nashik achieved another feat — allowing the same MP to retain his seat for the second time in a row. The only other time this had happened before was in 1971 with BR Kawade was re-elected back to back. In 2019 assembly elections, the city allowed BJP to retain all its seats in the city — though Nashik East’s BJP candidate was replaced. The same elections saw three women getting elected to the assembly. It may also be noted that the NMC mayor is a woman – Ranjana Bhansi (BJP) — and so is the president of Nashik Zilla Parishad – Sheetal Sangle (Shiv Sena). This means there are five women in very strong positions, with two holding Minister of State (MoS) rank. “Nashik is perhaps the only city in the state that has presented such a the variety and exhibited the ability to experiment,” a political observer said.

Residents from Pune Cantonment were the first to speak at the event. They were joined by residents from the Kasba Peth constituency. Candidates Ramesh Bagwe of Congress and Sunil Kamble of the BJP were urged by Pune Cantonment residents to resolve pending issues such as restriction on floor space index (FSI), overhaul of Britishera drainage lines, drinking water supply and traffic congestion. These were problems also listed in manifestos received from the constituency. KASBA PETH The residents of Kasba Peth said wada redevelopment has been a longpending demand.

"Maharashtra News: Amid CMship row, BJP, Sena to meet governor separately today | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: A day after both the BJP and Shiv Sena hardened their stand over the claim to the chief minister’s post, both parties are making a beeline to Raj Bhavan. CM Devendra Fadnavis and senior Shiv Sena leader and transport minister Diwakar Raote will separately meet governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Monday. “Although no agenda has been fixed, government formation will certainly be discussed. The CM may brief the governor on the current political situation, particularly the possibility of staking claim to form the next government. Raote too will present his party’s views, particularly the decision taken at the meeting of Shiv Sena legislators,’’ a senior BJP leader said. Uddhav now has remote control of power in Maharashtra, says Shiv SenaOn Saturday, Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had sought a written assurance from the BJP on the “50:50 formula” that includes sharing the CM’s post for 2.5 years each. Maharashtra: BJP disputes Shiv Sena’s equal share claimInitially, it was popularly believed that the BJP on its own would secure at least 145 seats—the majority figure required for government formation—and that it might not be required to approach the Shiv Sena, though the two parties had contested the assembly elections jointly. However, post-results, it seems the BJP may not be able to form the government on its own, and it must look to seek support of the Shiv Sena, Congress or NCP. The political grapevine suggests that once he is elected leader of the BJP legislative party, Fadnavis will stake claim to form the government, irrespective of whether Shiv Sena supports him or not. On the other hand, the Sena insists it won’t compromise on the CM’s post and that its nominee will assume that post for the first two-and-a-half years of the new term. A source close to the BJP leadership said, “Since BJP is the single largest party, the governor will have no option but to call Fadnavis for the formation of the government.’’ He pointed out that in 2014 too, although BJP did not have a clear majority, then governor Vidyasagar Rao had called Fadnavis to form the government following NCP’s support to BJP. “Fadnavis was asked to prove his majority on the floor of the house within a month. As per convention, Fadnavis will be sworn in as the CM and he may be given a week or a fortnight’s time to formally prove his party’s strength in the house. BJP leadership is in no mood to give the CM post to the Shiv Sena,’’ he said.

"Maharashtra Elections: Why Maharashtra, Haryana elections are about Article 370 vs economy | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The upcoming assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana are turning out to be a fierce battle between nullification of Article 370 and the state of Indian economy. Connecting it to nationalism, the ruling BJP has already declared that it is going to polls in the two states by making abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution as a referendum on the Narendra Modi government. Congress, on the other hand, has announced that it will highlight the “economic slowdown”. Statements of top leaders from both parties in the last few days strongly indicate that polls in Maharashtra and Haryana will be an Article 370 vs economy contest. Article 370BJP is launching the Jan Jagran Abhiyan (public awareness campaign) supporting abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A with regard to Jammu and Kashmir. As part of this programme, the party will organise 370 small indoor meetings and 35 big ones across the country, including six in Jammu and Kashmir. A few hours before the Prime Minister addressed the ‘Howdy, Modi!’ show in Houston on September 22, BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah spoke at a seminar in Mumbai on the Modi government’s “historical decision” to abrogate Article 370. Amit Shah said the Mumbai event was significant because it was the first one after the Election Commission on September 21 announced dates for assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana. Shah appealed to the people of Maharashtra to decide whether they were in favour of abrogation of Article 370 and 35A or against it. Amit Shah has also been asking former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and other senior leaders of his party to clarify whether they were in favour or against the scrapping of Article 370. On September 18, while speaking at Jamtara in Jharkhand, which is scheduled to go to polls later this year, the BJP president said, ""Our stand has been to remove Article 370 ever since it had been there,"" and asked ""why the Congress felt 'stomach ache' following its abrogation?"" Rahul Gandhi should tell people of Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana, when he goes there, whether he was with the decision to abrogate Article 370, he added. Shah also raked up the issue at Solapur in Maharashtra on September 1, when he said, ""I ask Rahul Gandhi and Sharad Pawar to make their stand clear on our decision to abrogate Article 370 and 35A of the Constitution before they go for campaigning in Maharashtra."" It was at Jind in Haryana on August 16 that Shah talked about the issue for the first time during a public rally. ""Abrogation of Article 370 and 35A is a big milestone for the unity and integrity of India. We had been saying that Kashmir was an integral part of India. But Article 370 was giving some sort of message that something is still incomplete,"" he said. ""From Jind rally, I want to tell the country that after removal of Article 370, whatever stumbling block in the development and progress of Jammu and Kashmir, Leh and Ladakh was there, has now been removed."" PM Modi has also been presenting the abrogation of Article 370 as one of the main achievements of his government. Addressing an election rally at Nashik in Maharashtra on September 19, Modi said the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir was the wish of 130 crore Indians. ""The decision has been taken to save the Kashmiris from the cycle of violence, terror and separatism. They suffered for 40 years due to Delhi's (previous Congress-led governments) wrong policies and 42,000 people were killed,"" he said. Modi attacked opposition leaders and said instead of supporting the government on the decision taken in national interest, they were making comments for their selfish political interests. ""When the country is united over the decision on Kashmir, Congress and NCP leaders have not cooperated,"" he said. Narendra Modi referred to Article 370 even at the ‘Howdy, Modi!’ show on September 22. He said, “For 70 years our country had yet another big challenge to which India has now given farewell just a few days ago… Article 370 had deprived the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh from development and equal rights. Forces of terrorism and separatism were taking advantage of the situation.” He went on to say, “The rights given by the Constitution of India to the rest of Indians are now available to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh too. Discrimination against women, children and dalits has now ended there,” inviting a huge round of applause from the 50,000-strong audience at the Houston event EconomyAs a counter to BJP’s Article 370 campaign, Congress is organising conventions from September 20 to 30 at the state level across the country to highlight the ""economic slowdown"". This will be followed by “massive agitations” across the country from October 15 to October 25 against the Modi government’s policies that have led to the “economic slowdown”. Besides, senior party leaders such as president Sonia Gandhi, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi and former finance minister P Chidambaram, who is currently lodged in Tihar Jail, have been trying to corner the Modi government over the state of the economy. On September 18, Rahul tweeted, ““Howdy” economy doin’, Mr Modi? Ain’t too good it seems.” Two days later, he again tweeted, “Amazing what PM is ready to do for a stock market bump during his #HowdyIndianEconomy jamboree. At +1.4 lakh crore rupees, the Houston event is the world's most expensive event, ever! But, no event can hide the reality of the economic mess “HowdyModi” has driven India into.” Amazing what PM is ready to do for a stock market bump during his #HowdyIndianEconomy jamboree. At + 1.4 Lakh Cro… https://t.co/XrjMghChE6— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) 1568971344000Days earlier, when Congress leaders met at the party headquarters on September 12, Rahul Gandhi said, “What India needs isn’t propaganda, manipulated news cycles and foolish theories about millennials but a concrete plan to fix the economy that we can all get behind. Acknowledging that we have a problem is a good place to start.” While chairing the same meeting of the Congress general secretaries, state presidents and the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leaders, Sonia Gandhi said, “We are meeting at a time when there is a prolonged economic slump, when job losses are mounting by the day, when the confidence of the investors is getting shakier by the day, when the government appears more and more clueless and insensitive by the day.” Manmohan Singh said the country is today in the midst of a dangerous protracted slowdown. “The dangerous thing about the present situation is that the government is complacent enough not to realise that we are in the midst of a protracted economic slowdown,” he said, adding that his successor talks about achieving a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024 but it now looks like a dream. “It is our responsibility and duty to convey this message to the country on how the BJP has misled the people and what is being done is only cosmetic to push up the atmosphere, but that the situation in the country is that what was promised is not being delivered,” he said. Singh also alleged that the government was following a policy of “tax terrorism” and warned of one million job losses if immediate steps were not taken to reverse the slump in the auto sector. Even though Chidambaram is having a brush with the law, he sought to portray that India’s decline of GDP growth rate to 5 per cent was a bigger concern than his arrest.

Saffron vote share in district suffers huge setback | Nashik News - Times of India,"NASHIK: The saffron parties have suffered a major setback in the recently concluded 2019 assembly elections in comparison with 2014 edition as Congress-NCP alliance being the major gainers. In 2014 elections, Shiv Sena-BJP enjoyed a healthy 47.03 percent vote share as against to 38.49 percent in the current edition, which saw a drop of 8.54 percentage. Ahead of the assembly elections, both parties declared pre-poll an alliance between both the parties. On the other hand, NCP-Congress gained in the recent elections with them bagging 39.86 percent as compared to 37.53 in the 2014 elections witnessing a rise of 2.33 percent votes. The fall in the percentage would be a major concern for the saffron party think-tank. “The rise of secular forces in the form of Congress and NCP is not that big as the fall of the BJP-SS. The saffron forces despite putting up a combined fight and failing to increase the percentage from the last elections is a cause of worry for the BJP-SS camp as Congress-NCP see this a chance to regain their lost glory,” the political observers said, Contesting individually, the BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP had four seats each and the Congress bagged two, meaning that saffron brigade had eight seats and secular has seven. But in the 2019 outcome, the BJP gained by one seat to take it's tally to 5 (of six seats it contested), NCP gained by two seats to take its tally to six (of the 10 seats it contested), Shiv Sena lost two to take its tally to two (of 9 seats contested) and Congress tally dropped to one (from six seats it contested), while MIM gained one seat. Now the saffron as well as secular brigades have seven seats each. “Though the results of the elections depict a winning picture, the shifting of votes encodes a secret for the future. This could possibly reflect in any kind of forthcoming elections in the region. The elections to Nashik Municipal Corporation and the Zilla Parishad are the next elections on the card,” said a senior leader from the BJP, though he declined to comment on the decline in voting percentage. The BJP is ruling the NMC that has witnessed various political parties at the helm of affairs from time-to-time. Similarly, the Shiv Sena is ruling the Zilla Parishad Nashik (rural areas) which has always been the bastion of Congress and NCP. While NCP’s edge over Shiv Sena would cast dark clouds over the Shiv Sena’s future in ZP, the glimpses of NMC emerging at the time of elections makes interesting times given that the BJP has retained its seats in the city areas.

"Maharashtra assembly polls: In two Pune seats, ‘no choice’ between joy and heartbreak | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: A decade ago, ‘None of the Above’ (NOTA) made its debut as a way for voters to reject the candidates in the fray. Cut to 2019, it has become a symbol, so to speak, of an empty protest — it holds no electoral value. That said, the NOTA button has swung a fortune or two in the assembly elections in Pune. In the Khadakwasla constituency, NOTA’s 1.42% vote share was the difference between victory and heartbreak for National Congress Party’s Sachin Dodke, who had held the lead for a large portion of the day. Dodke had to settle for the bridesmaids finish — BJP’s incumbent Tapkir won by 2,592 votes, while NOTA polled 3,561. Incidentally, Tapkir’s was the slimmest margin of victory in the 11 seats in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Similarly in Hadapsar, NCP’s Chetan Tupe pipped BJP’s sitting MLA Yogesh Tilekar by a mere 2,870 votes, or 1.18% of the vote share. In this case, NOTA polled 2,474 votes (1.04%), while independent candidate Anjum Zakariya Inamdar bagged 367 (0.15%) — votes that might just have given Tilekar a second term in the house. Political scientist Suhas Palshikar said this was the first time he was seeing NOTA have any discernible impact in an urban seat. “This is the first time we are observing such a trend in an urban constituency. Through our research, we have observed that it is mostly voters from rural parts that press the NOTA button,” Palshikar said. Palshikar, however, said this may not always be intentional on their part. “It may not always be a conscious or informed decision; in all probability, they (rural voters) press the button because it’s at the bottom,” Palshikar said. Palshikar, as a part of the Lokniti research collective, has studied NOTA and its impact on the last assembly elections in Karnataka and Gujarat. Interestingly, in the Latur Rural and Palus-Kadegaon constituencies, NOTA was the runner-up, with 27,500 (13.78%) and 20,361 (9.99%) of the votes respectively. However, the system lacks effectiveness, considering that the candidate with the most votes will be declared the victor even if NOTA were to register a higher number of votes. Palshikar suggests that the rules be reworked to give NOTA enough heft, should it poll high enough. “There should be new norms governing the quantum of NOTA votes, especially in cases where their numbers are significantly high,” he said.

"Maharashtra assembly polls: More than 50,000 pick NOTA in district after farm crises and candidate disconnect | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Rising use of ‘None Of The Above’ (NOTA) option was quite evident in Pune district where 51,207 voters across the 21 assembly constituencies chose it over the candidates. Chinchwad and Kothrud recorded 5,874 and 4028 NOTA votes in the urban constituencies, while Shirur and Bhor registered 1,826 and 1,808 NOTA in the rural segments. This trend was more prominent in the urban segments. As many as 36,214 NOTA votes were registered in the 11 constituencies of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad while the NOTA score in 10 rural constituencies was 14,993. Activists, citizens and political analysts said voters are not happy with the performance of politicians, their plans or views about development. “If you do not get adequate civic facilities, why would you cast your vote for a party candidate?,” said Shekhar Singh, a software professional from Pimple Saudagar. Issues like traffic congestion, haphazard road works and inadequate drinking water supply have not been resolved. Citizens suffer because of these problems, he added. At some places, the voters were not happy with the candidates. “In Kothrud, the BJP chose to bring a candidate from Kolhapur instead of giving the ticket to a sitting MLA. Voters were not confident about the MNS candidate either which triggered the NOTA option,” said Kothrud resident Satish Kale. Vivek Ghotale, executive director of Unique Foundation which deals with social science research, termed this trend ‘positive’ and ‘healthy’ for a democracy. “The electors were not only serious about politics but also about the candidates. If they do not connect with them, they rejected them,” Ghotale told TOI. Agrarian distress and the poor condition of roads were among the main problems in Shirur and Bhor. “No politician stepped in to help them which upset them and hence they rejected all candidates,” Vijay Jadhav, a farmer from Bhor, said. NOTA votes have played a crucial role in Daund assembly segment, where BJP’s Rahul Kul retained his seat by 746 votes. NOTA got 917 votes here.

"7.42 lakh voters in Maharashtra chose NOTA, 65,000 in Haryana | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: The number of voters who pressed the None of the Above (NOTA) button during the recently-held assembly elections in Maharashtra rose to 7,42,134 (1.3% of the total votes polled) from the 4.6 lakh who exercised the option in the 2014 assembly polls. Haryana, which also conducted assembly elections simultaneously with Maharashtra, recorded 65,672 NOTA votes (0.52% of the total votes) as against 53,381 in 2014. Political analyst Ajit Ranade told TOI that while it has taken time for voters to choose the NOTA option, the rise in the number of voters exercising the option in both Maharashtra and Haryana comes as a clear signal for political parties to put up better candidates. He pointed out that in some constituencies, NOTA has significantly reduced the margins of the winning candidates. Analysts said the NOTA option gives voters an outlet to vent their frustration at not finding suitable candidates in the fray. They said it was motivation for the people to participate in the voting process even though they were dissatisfied with the candidates. The number of people pressing the NOTA button was only set to increase in the coming years, they felt. A voter who used the NOTA option this time told TOI that she was not happy with any of the candidates in the present elections. As citizen groups say, disillusionment with the poll process because of the absence of good candidates is slowly manifesting in people using the NOTA option. However, while both Maharashtra and Haryana have revised the rules to give NOTA more teeth in the local elections — polls will be held again if the NOTA number is higher than the votes garnered by the winning candidate — the same is not the case for the Lok Sabha and assembly elections. In Latur Rural constituency, NOTA got the second highest votes at 27,500, accounting for 13.78% of the total votes polled for the seat. The winning candidate, Dhiraj Deshmukh of the Congress, secured 1,35,006 votes (67%). After Deshmukh and NOTA, Shiv Sena’s Sachin Deshmukh and VBA’s Baliram Done polled 13,524 and 12,966 votes respectively. In the Palus Kadegaon constituency, NOTA again got the second highest votes at 20,631. The seat was won by Congress candidate Vishwajeet Kadam, who defeated Sanjay Vibhute of the Sena by a margin of 1,62,521 votes. In the Akkaluwa constituency, 4,856 voters pressed the NOTA button. The seat was bagged by Congress candidate KC Padavi, who defeated the Sena’s Aamshya Fulji by 2,096 votes. In Haryana too, NOTA played spoilsport for many candidates. In Thanesar, BJP’s Subhash Sudha won by a margin of just 842 votes against Ashok Kumar Arora of the Congress. Here, 951 NOTA votes were polled. In Sirsa, leader of the Haryana Lokhit Party Gopal Kanda won by just 602 votes against independent candidate Gokul Setia. NOTA’s share was 579 votes. In Ratia, NOTA got 1,086 votes while the victory margin of the BJP’s Lakshman Napa was just 1,216 votes. Interestingly, NOTA secured more votes than the Aam Aadmi Party in both Haryana (0.48% vote share) and Maharashtra (0.11%). Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
BSP confident of opening account in Maharashtra Assembly | Nagpur News - Times of India,"NAGPUR: The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is fielding candidates in 264 seats across the state for the coming state Assembly elections, and in all 62 seats of Vidarbha where it has some presence and cadre support. Party’s national general secretary Ashok Siddharth, who is also a Rajya Sabha member and in-charge of Maharashtra affairs, said here on Friday that the BSP was very much confident of winning some seats and opening its account in the state Assembly. BSP supremo Mayawati will be in town and sound the campaign bugle for all 62 seats in the region through her sole public rally at Indora grounds at 3pm on Monday. The local unit is hopeful that the party chief’s presence in the stronghold of Nagpur North constituency would galvanize supporters to vote for party candidate Suresh Sakhre who could be the one to ride the ‘Elephant’ (party symbol) into the state Assembly this time. October 14 is also Mahaparivirvana Day that the Buddhists observe with reverence. It is on this day in 1956 that Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar embraced Buddhism breaking away from Hinduism. Mayawati’s Indora ground rally will be repeated after a gap of 13 years. She last addressed a massive rally on this ground on October 14, 2006. In subsequent elections, her rally venue was shifted to Kasturchand Park for logistical reasons. The party’s hopes arise from the fact that in 2014 elections, BSP candidate Kishor Gajbhiye got more votes than Congress nominee Nitin Raut even though he lost to BJP’s Dr Milin Mane. This time, Sakhre, who is party’s state president, is in the poll fray as Gajbhiye shifted to Congress. Yet, there are many feel who that Gajbhiye got more than 55,000 votes because of his higher profile as an ex-bureaucrat. He also attracted votes of those unhappy with Raut. Yet, the BSP is trying to build on last time’s performance, though its cadre votes are less than 25,000 in North Nagpur. “We should do better this time as we have fielded good candidates drawn from party ranks unlike earlier elections where new faces not necessarily from the within party were given a chance,” said Siddharth.

Kolhapur: Strategy confusion prevails in Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi | Kolhapur News - Times of India,"KOLHAPUR: The Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) appears to be mired in confusion over its strategy for the assembly elections in Kolhapur. Earlier this week, VBA had extended support to Samarjit Ghatge, who is contesting as an independent from Kagal, only to later withdraw it. Local VBA leaders claimed the decision was taken in haste and that they were rethinking it. In some other seats, there is a lack of clarity over the party’s direction, with some leaders supporting candidates of other parties even with official VBA candidates in the fray. Party leaders said their ship needs to be righted, and soon. “VBA had already extended support to local leaders before announcing the nominations,” one party leader, requesting anonymity, said. “For instance, support was extended to Prakash Awade from Ichalkaranji and Ghatge from Kagal. However, VBA’s candidate is now contesting against Awade, while we withdrew support to Ghatge. Our strategy is in disarray and we need to rethink supporting other candidates, as our official candidates are unhappy,” the leader added. Party leaders, meanwhile, are unhappy with nominations by VBA and their allies. From Chandgad, Vinayak Patil, a former Zilla Parishad member of the NCP, was given the ticket. VBA nominated Jeevan Patil, a former Congress leader, from Radhanagari. “Offering tickets to defectors will not go down well with our core voters, who are from the backward and minority communities,” a local VBA leader said. “Tickets were given not to ‘vanchit’ candidates (those from the socially oppressed sections), but to those from the ‘upper’ social strata,” another leader said.

 BJP: Parties rejected by people have stolen popular mandate | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday said that parties ""rejected by people"" in the assembly elections in Maharashtra had joined hands to ""steal"" the popular mandate. It also rejected the opposition's criticism over its decision to form government despite lacking numbers, with its spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao saying it had done so in ""good faith"" after being assured of NCP's support by its leader Ajit Pawar. Rao also had a swipe at his party's former ally Shiv Sena, saying its tally might not have not reached double digits without BJP's support but it ""cynically"" exploited the post-poll situation to sacrifice its ideology at the altar of power politics. BJP was equally peeved at Congress's boycott of Constitution Day celebrations in Parliament and party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said it was an ""insult"" to Bhimrao Ambedkar. ""Constitution Day is above political differences. Congress's absence from Central Hall is an insult to Dr Ambedkar, the father of the Constitution, but this is nothing new. Earlier also, the party did the same thing by not giving him Bharat Ratna,"" he said. He said everyone had a right to protest but some days were above politics. ""It is a national day beyond political divide. It is the day when every Indian feels proud. This behaviour is irresponsible and amounts to disrespecting the Constitution,"" Prasad added.

Maharashtra elections: Shiv Sena MP’s wife faces 37 rivals in Nanded South constituency | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: The electoral contest in the Nanded South is set to grab attention because this Marathawada constituency has the highest number of candidates (38) in the fray for the assembly  on October 21. Rajshree Patil, the wife of Hingoli MP Hemant Patil, has got the Shiv Sena ticket and she needs to defeat 37 opponents to bag a win in Nanded South. Rajshree was instrumental in her husband’s recent LS poll campaign. Her candidature, however, has sparked a rebellion within the BJP camp. Nanded district BJP head Dilip Kandkurte has pitched himself as an independent. Pravin Patil, the son of BJP Nanded MP Pratap Patil Chikhalikar, has been sharing the dais with Kandkurte, raising many eyebrows. Moreover, Chikhalikar stayed away from a major Sena rally held in Nanded on Wednesday, fuelling speculations that he might also be backing Kandkurte. The BJP camp reportedly is unhappy with the Sena retaining the Loha-Kandhar seat. Kandkurte enjoys significant support among the trader community in the district. He is said to be close to senior BJP leader and finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. Hemant Patil had represented the Nanded South seat as a Sena MLA before he got elected to the Lok Sabha. Notably, Kandkurte had locked horns with Patil in the 2014 assembly election and had lost by about 3,200 votes. Congress, meanwhile, has given the ticket to Mohanrao Hambarde, who is also considered a strong prospect. A relatively fresher face when it comes to assembly elections in Nanded, Hambarde has a considerable following in the rural areas of Nanded South. The alleged anti-incumbency associated with the Hemant Patil’s term as an MLA from 2014 to 2019, together with BJP rebellion and strong poll preparations by the Congress could be major hurdles before Rajshree in securing her maiden term as an MLA, say political observers. Addressing a rally in Nanded on Wednesday, Patil targetted the BJP rebel. “We will defeat the rebel in the election. We will hit where it hurts most,” he said. Later, speaking to the media, Patil said he had personally invited Chikhalikar to the rally. “I called him thrice. Why he did not come is best known to him,” Patil said. Farooq Ahmed Iqbal Ahmed of Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), Mohammed Chaus of MIM and Vishwanath Dhotare of BSP, besides a long list of independents are among the 38 candidates who have thrown their hat in the ring for Nanded South.

It soon turned out that the Rohit Pawar, whose candidature was rejected, was not NCP chief's grand-nephew. Rather, he just shared his name with the firebrand youth leader of the NCP.

Most rejections (44) were from Bhokar in Nanded. However, NCP and Congress did suffer some genuine setbacks in Aurangabad and Nashik. Papers of Congress nominee Ramesh Gaikwad in Aurangabad West were rejected as he had concealed information about offences against him. He was seen as a strong challenger to sitting Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsath. ""I will approach the high court...,"" Gaikwad said. The returning officer at Paithan didn't accept a last-minute change in candidature requested by NCP state president Jayant Patil. NCP had given the mandatory A-B form to Dattatrey Gorde, instead of whom Patil requested that the fresh A-B form given to Sanjay Waghchaure be accepted.

"After 2014 case, lawyer questions Devendra Fadnavis' new affidavit | Nagpur News - Times of India","NAGPUR: Opponents of CM Devendra Fadnavis from the Nagpur South West constituency raised objections over his nomination form, creating a daylong drama at the collector’s office. However, the objections were rejected by the election returning officer (RO) Shekhar Ghadge, who accepted the nomination form. Advocate Satish Uke, who recently success in the Supreme Court with the apex court ordering the trial court to consider afresh a complaint filed by him about the CM’s 2014 poll affidavit, was the first to lodge a complaint with Ghadge and the state election commission on Saturday morning. Then Congress candidate Ashish Deshmukh and independent candidate Prashant Pawar lodged their complaints. Uke had told the SC that Fadnavis had not mentioned two criminal cases in his 2014 affidavit. Along with his nomination form this time, Fadnavis had on October 3 submitted an affidavit notarized by V P Sontakey. All pages of the affidavit had Sontakey’s stamp which stated, “My term expires on 28/12/2018.” The objectors said the notary’s registration period had lapsed before he had notarized the affidavit and demanded rejection of the CM’s form. Ghadge in his order said, “Fadnavis’s election agent Sandip Joshi submitted the registration certificate of…Sontakey responding to objections. It is found that the tenure of the notary’s registration has been extended by five years from 28/12/2018. Objections raised by complainants have no substance.” The same notary had put a similar stamp on Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s affidavit for the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year. Deshmukh and Pawar said they would challenge the RO’s order in the SC. Collector Ravindra Thakre said, “The returning officer is the final authority for rejection or acceptance of nomination forms and complaints related to nominations. Aggrieved persons will have to move to the court of law in case of objections to the decisions of returning officers.” Sandip Joshi, ruling party leader in the Nagpur civic body, termed the allegation that the CM’s affidavit was invalid baseless. “The SC in two judgments has ruled it is not even necessary for the notarized document to have a stamp. The important thing is that the person is in front of the notary. Fadnavis was present and there is an entry in the notary’s register about the affidavit. It can’t be backdated,” he said.

Maharashtra sees 1.15 lakh rise in disabled electors | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The state has registered an increase of nearly 1.15 lakh differently abled electors taking the total tally to 3.49 lakh as against 2.24 lakh voters registered in the Lok Sabha elections. This is the first time that differently abled voters have been marked separately so that facilities of transportation can be provided if needed and these voters can be allocated polling stations on the ground floor, said officials. “Wherever it is unavoidable it has been ensured that polling stations are located in buildings with functional lifts and volunteers deputed to help, particularly the senior citizens and people with disabilities,’’ the officials added. The Election Commission of India (ECI) will provide pickup and drop facility to disabled voters free of cost during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The move was aimed at facilitating persons with disability (PwD). ""Currently, these voters are carried to the polling booths by some political party, obliging the voters to caste their vote in favour of the party. The ECI wants to avoid it, as there have been instances of conflicts between the supporters of contesting candidates due to it,"" said an official from election department. The commission had during the Lok Sabha elections developed a mobile application named as PWD, which will be activated in a couple of days, using which the voters who have enrolled themselves as persons with disabilities (PwD) can inform the ECI in availing the pickup and drop service. However, if the differently abled do not mark themselves they can intimate the election officials about the same. Under ECI rules, votrers with disabilities are given priority at polling stations, enabling them to enter, and cast their vote without waiting in the queue. Polling station personnel are properly trained in assisting the disabled. The rules also permit an attendant to accompany a blind/infirm voter. Election booth staff are also trained and sensitized on special needs of persons affected by various disabilities. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

All along, Khadse was expecting that in view of his seniority in the party, he will be nominated, but when there was no response from the party, Khadse was in two minds, whether to contest as an independent or knock at the doors of NCP president Sharad Pawar. In between, talk of his joining the NCP gained momentum after Pawar told media persons that in last three months, the BJP leader had spoken to him on several occasions. Khadse immediately refuted Pawar's statement, saying, leave aside three months, but he did not speak to any of the Pawars during the last thee years. Ever since Khadse was involved in the MIDC land deal, he was at the receiving end. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Politics News."
"Maharashtra, Haryana election results 2019: Stage set for counting of votes in Maharashtra, Haryana; stakes high for BJP, Congress | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The stage is set for counting of votes for assembly polls in Haryana and Maharashtra on Thursday with stakes high for Congress, which could not do well in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year and also for the BJP, which is incumbent in the two states. Along with the two states, results will also be declared for assembly bypolls on 51 seats across 17 states and will have political implications for the parties in power. The results of bypolls to Satara and Samastipur Lok Sabha seats will also be declared on Thursday. The assembly poll results will also be crucial for the NCP in Maharashtra, which is an ally of Congress, as also for parties such as Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, AIMIM and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. In Haryana also, the battle is crucial for regional parties such as the Indian National Lok Dal and the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP). The BSP has also fielded candidates in the two states. ALSO READ: Maharashtra,Haryana Election Results LiveThe exit polls have predicted the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena alliance getting elected in Maharashtra but have differed in their projection of a number of seats. Most exit polls have also predicted a clear victory for BJP in Haryana. One exit poll, however, has said that the two parties are in a close race in the state and none of them would get a majority. The BJP will create history if it again wins Haryana and returns to power with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. The assembly elections are the first after the BJP-led government's decision to repeal Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and a verdict in its favour will give a boost to the party ahead of the winter session of Parliament next month. A victory will also keep the political momentum with the BJP after its emphatic victory in the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The polls are crucial for Congress which has faced desertions after its second successive debacle in the Lok Sabha polls. A strong performance will help the party in its process of electoral revival. The BJP has already declared that incumbent chief ministers - Manohar Lal Khattar and Devendra Fadnavis - will continue to lead the governments if the party is voted to power. The voting took place in the two states and in the bypoll seats on Monday. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"Rebellion, protests hit saffron alliance over seats, nominations | Nashik News - Times of India","Large-scale discontent and anger within the BJP and Shiv Sena over seat-sharing and nominations spilled onto the streets on Wednesday in Nagpur and Aurangabad, while upset workers also resigned from both parties. Former Nagpur mayor Pravin Datke protested with his supporters at Badkas chowk in the city after being denied a nomination from Nagpur Central, which went to Vikas Kumbhare. Sudhakar Kohale, sitting MLA from Nagpur South, went to Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s house to plead his case after he was replaced by Mohan Mate. The new nominees were also present at the minister’s house to seek a check on rebellion. Sena leaders from Nashik and Pune are upset that all seats in both cities have been given to BJP. The BJP is yet to announce its candidate for Nashik East but former city unit president Balasaheb Sanap and over 30 corporators from the party in the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) have threatened to resign if he is not given the ticket. They gathered in front of Sanap’s residence and displayed banners in his support. Sena corporators from Nashik met at a city hotel and decided to field one of their leaders as an independent in Nashik West, from where the BJP has renominated sitting MLA Seema Hiray. “The Sena has got none of the three seats in Nashik city, which has completely demoralised the party rank-and-file. We will field an independent in Nashik West and work for the candidate instead of the BJP nominee,” a Sena leader said. Senior Sena corporator Vilas Shinde, who is keen on contesting the polls, said the party high command must understand the sentiments of the workers in Nashik city. “We have 35 corporators in the NMC. Our local party unit will put up a candidate as an independent. We are confident of our prospects,” he claimed. In Pune, BJP corporator Kiran Dagade from Bavdhan has expressed his intention of contesting as an independent from Bhor, a seat which has gone to the Sena. The BJP workers from Shivajinagar and Pune Cantonment are not ready to accept the candidatures of Siddharth Shirole and Sunil Kamble. In the Pimpri assembly constituency, BJP loyalist Amit Gorkhe, president, Annabhau Sathe Corporation, has rebelled and will submit his nomination form. Sena has renominated its Pimpri MLA Gautam Chabukswar from here. All BJP functionaries from Sillod in Aurangabad submitted their resignation to the party top brass on Tuesday after former MLA Abdul Sattar was given a ticket by the Sena. This could dent Sattar’s poll prospects to some extent. Contesting on a Congress ticket in the 2014 assembly elections, Sattar had won by a margin of over 13,900 against BJP candidate Suresh Bankar. Sena had a vote share of hardly 7.5% in that election. BJP fielded chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ personal assistant Abhimanyu Pawar from Ausa in Latur, a move that has upset both BJP and Sena workers there. Pawar is to take on Congress MLA Basavraj Patil. Earlier, the seat was being contested by the Sena, but the party seems to have exchanged it for the Latur rural constituency. Such was the opposition to Pawar that both Sena and BJP workers took to the streets in Ausa on Wednesday. They also gheraoed guardian minister Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar, demanding that the BJP-Sena field either Bajrang Jadhav, the BJP’s ZP agriculture committee chairman, or Sena leader Dinkar Mane in place of Pawar. Bajrang Sonwane, a prominent BJP face in the constituency, told TOI, “Pawar is an outsider. We want our parties to field a ‘bhumi putra’ (son of the soil) otherwise one of us is ready to contest.” Jadhav, who could be the rebel candidate, asserted that they had made it clear to the minister that they would not tolerate Pawar’s nomination. “He (Patil Nilangekar) told us that he would communicate our demand to the party leadership. One thing is certain: either me or some other leader could be a consensus candidate if our demand is considered,” he said. Manikrao Kokate, who was expelled from the BJP for contesting the Lok Sabha elections as a rebel earlier this year, joined the NCP on Wednesday and was announced as the party’s official candidate from Sinnar. He will fight against sitting Sena MLA Rajabhau Waje, who has been renominated. Kokate was a Congress MLA both in 2004 and 2009 but joined the BJP in 2014 and unsucessfully contested the Sinnar seat. Rebellion broke out in the BJP in Kalyan (West) on Tuesday, where the seat held by party MLA Narendra Pawar has been given to the Sena. The Sena has swapped the seat for Airoli, which the BJP had asked for. Six BJP corporators from Kalyan, along with Pawar, resigned. Sena is yet to announce its candidate for the seat. Sena nominated Prakash Surve in Magathane constituency in Mumbai, upsetting BJP’s Pravin Darekar who demonstrated against the party’s decision to give the seat to Sena.

BJP &amp; Congress face challenge to keep rebellion at bay in poll run-up | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: A day after declaring their respective candidates for the October 21 assembly elections, both the BJP and the Congress leaderships are busy mulling ways to pacify the rebels, independents and workers disgruntled over distribution of tickets in many assembly segments here. The parties now have an uphill task to keep rebellion at bay. The BJP faces an additional task to pacify the Shiv Sena cadre upset with the party's non-presence in the poll arena. BJP corporator Kiran Dagade, who is from the Bavdhan area, is planning to contest as an independent from Bhor, a seat that has gone to the Sena. Several BJP workers from Shivajinagar and Pune Cantonment are opposing the candidatures of Siddharth Shirole and Sunil Kamble, respectively. Bharat Vairage, a BJP leader from Pune Cantonemnt, said despite working actively for the party for many years, he has been ignored. A party worker from Shivajinagar said he was not ready to accept Siddharth's candidature. He said, ""Siddharth was elected as a corporator two years ago. There are many senior leaders who deserved the Shivajinagar ticket."" The strong opposition to the candidature of BJP's state unit president Chandrakanat Patil continued in Kothurd. Civic activist Vishwambhar Chaudhari, who was once closely associated with social crusader Anna Hazare, claimed that he was told by farmer leader Raju Shetti to contest the election from Kothurd against Patil. Sena corporators Vishal Dhanawade (Kasba Peth) and Nana Bhangire (Hadapsar) have expressed their desire to contest as independents. Sena leader Sanjay Bhosale from Yerawada is planning to join the fray from Wadgaonsheri. ""It is a question of the Sena's presence in the city. We are ready to file nominations,"" Dhanawade said. In a first jolt to the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in Pimpri Chinchwad city, BJP loyalist and Annabhau Sathe Corporation president Amit Gorkhe, has said he would submitting his nomination form to contest the Pimpri constituency. The BJP has been demanging the seat from the Shiv Sena. The Congress is likely to face the rebellion challenge in Kasba Peth. Party corporator Ravindra Dhangekar appeared unhappy with Arvind Shinde's candidature. Dhangekar is planning to throw his hat into the ring under the banner of the Kasba Peth Vikas Aghadi.

Maharashtra assembly election: Ex-CM Prithviraj Chavan and MLAs 'wooed by BJP' on Congress list | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The AICC on Wednesday nominated former CM Prithviraj Chavan from Karad (South) for the assembly elections, while Dhiraj, son of former CM Vilasrao Deshmukh, will contest from Latur (rural). They were among 52 Congress nominees declared by the Congress on Wednesday. Initially, the AICC had asked Chavan to contest the by-election for the Satara Lok Sabha seat against Udayan Raje Bhosale, who resigned from NCP and joined BJP recently. In fact, Chavan's name did not figure in the first list of Congress candidates. However, following his meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the AICC agreed to nominate him for the assembly elections. A Congress leader said the nomination of two legislators, Kunal Patil from Dhule (rural) and Rahul Bondre (Chikhali) assumes importance as they were among the several Congress legislators being lured by the BJP. ""It's a fact that many Congress legislators were on their way to joining the BJP and Shiv Sena on the eve of the polls following mounting pressure from the BJP. I am sure they will not fall into the trap,"" Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. A former Congress minister said there was no doubt initially an exodus from the party, and leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil too resigned from the party and joined the BJP, but the Congress has now been able to stem it.

"Election Results 2019: How Congress lost a chance to prove itself in Haryana, Maharashtra elections | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Congress failed to take advantage of the perception of economic slowdown and local discontent against the ruling BJP-led NDA and, in the process, it lost a golden chance to wrest power from BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana. Congress presented itself as a party which lost steam after the drubbing it got in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections even after it had defeated the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh assembly elections last year. As a result, the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance got the advantage of the first-past-the-post electoral system in Maharashtra. Further, BJP emerged as the single-largest party in Haryana followed closely by Congress. These are the reasons why Congress missed a golden chance to revive in both Maharashtra and Haryana: LeadershipCongress is undergoing a major leadership crisis. Rahul Gandhi unceremoniously resigned as the party president after Congress managed to increase its tally in the Lok Sabha elections from 44 in 2014 to 52 this year and he himself lost the family bastion of Amethi. On the one hand he took responsibility for the electoral debacle but on the other hand he also blamed the senior party leaders by stating in his resignation letter that at times he stood completely alone in his fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS and the institutions they have allegedly captured. Senior Congress leaders appealed to Rahul Gandhi not to resign but he stuck to his decision and in the end the party chose his mother and predecessor Sonia Gandhi to lead it as an interim president. This nature of temporariness in the leadership has adversely impacted the morale of the party workers and confidence of the voters. The leaders have expressed their concern for the party. Salman Khurshid recently said the “biggest problem” for Congress was that Rahul Gandhi “walked away” after the Lok Sabha defeat and which “left a vacuum”. Other leaders expressed similar sentiments. RalliesCongress proved no match to the BJP carpet-bombing for campaign. Sonia Gandhi did not address a single rally. She was scheduled to address one at Mahendragarh in Haryana on October 18, a day before campaigning came to and end, but it was cancelled at the last moment and Rahul filled the gap. As far as Rahul Gandhi is concerned, his campaigning was too late and too little. He left for Bangkok on October 5 and came back on October 9 to appear before courts in defamation cases against him in Surat and Ahmedabad on October 10 and October 11 respectively. He campaigned for only two days each in Haryana and Maharashtra, addressing two rallies in the former and five in the latter state. As against this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah addressed 14 rallies in Haryana and 28 in Maharashtra. IssuesModi and Shah focused on issues such as nullification of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution changing the status of Jammu and Kashmir, promise of implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the achievements of the two state governments led by Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal Khattar. But Rahul Gandhi chose to repeat the issues which he had harped on in the Lok Sabha elections and were rejected by the people. He continued with his tirade against the Modi government over matters such as alleged corruption in the Rafale fighter aircraft deal, absconding businessmen such as Ambanis, Adani, Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya and Mehul Choksi and Nyay (minimum income guarantee) scheme. His attack on the Modi government over economic slowdown, unemployment and farmers’ distress seem to have found some resonance with the voters this time around, particularly in Haryana. However, this wasn’t enough for the party to beat BJP. InfightingBJP’s rivals Congress, NCP and the Chautalas are beset with infighting helping the ruling party in both the states. Senior leaders in Maharashtra Sanjay Nirupam and Murli Deora and in Haryana Ashok Tanwar and Bhupinder Singh Hooda were in collision course. While Nirupam withdrew from campaigning, Tanwar quit Congress dealing severe blows to the party. Congress replaced Ashok Tanwar quit late in the day. Had it made the changes even a year ago, the results would have been better for the party. The Sharad Pawar-led NCP in Maharashtra and the Chautalas in Haryana bickered among themselves, which adversely impacted the morale of their parties’ rank and file and handed out advantage to BJP. The opposition parties such as Congress and NCP got weakened as they witnessed large-scale defections to the ruling BJP. Vote shareThe opposition parties had a large gap to cover in relation to BJP and in terms of percentage of vote share. In 2014 Maharashtra assembly election, when BJP and Shiv Sena had contested separately, the former garnered 27.81 per cent of the votes winning 122 of the 288 seats. Shiv Sena on the other hand got 19.3 per cent of the votes and won 63 seats. Together, they got 47.11 per cent of votes and won 185 seats. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP got a vote share of 27.59 per cent on 27 of the 48 seats. Shiv Sena garnered 23.29 per cent of the votes polled. Together, their vote share increased to 50.88 per cent. In the 2014 Haryana assembly election, BJP had won 33.2 per cent of the votes polled. This shot up to 58.02 per cent vote in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Congress failed to cover this gap. In the recently-held Maharashtra assembly election, the vote share of BJP was 25.75 per cent on 164 seats it contested and 16.41 per cent of Shiv Sena on 124 seats it fought, which comes to a total of 42.16 per cent. In contrast to this, the vote share of Congress was 15.87 per cent and that of its ally NCP was 16.71 per cent, totalling 32.58 per cent. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Maharashtra govt close to realising promise on homes for poor | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: When the BJP-led government came to power in the state in 2014, it announced a target of building 19 lakh homes in urban areas before 2022. Five years down the line, 13 lakh of the promised tenements have been sanctioned. Of these, construction of 4 lakh homes are on in full swing and people will get possession between 18 and 24 months from now, according to Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (Mhada), the nodal agency for the project’s execution. The picture is better in rural areas, where possession of 3.6 lakh homes (out of 4.5 lakh sanctioned) has already been given, said sources in the Union ministry for rural development. Finance for this ambitious project comes from the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY), the Centre’s flagship project. Nearly 50% of urban houses under PMAY are to be constructed in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. In Mumbai, these tenements are to be constructed through the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme; the Slum Authority has issued a letter of intent for two lakh units, said Mhada officials. The main stumbling block in project implementation, said officials, was availability of land, more so, in Mumbai, where real estate rates are among the highest in the word. In contrast, in rural Maharashtra, the government ensured that all those who had land and wanted a house under the scheme got funds in a phased manner; money was given directly to owners constructing their own tenements. Also, in case of the landless, granting land was not a problem as land is available in rural areas for cheap. Mhada officials said tenements are being constructed in most districts across the state. The beneficiaries may, however, face challenges of transport and sanitation as most of them are located in areas that do not have well-developed civic infrastructure, said activists. Mhada officials, however, claimed that one of the prerequisites before sanctioning a PMAY scheme in an area is access to water supply. “Also, most of these areas at least have bus services and we construct sewage treatment plans,” said the official. Mhada has so far received over 20 lakh applications for 13.23 lakh homes, priced between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 17 lakh for a 330-sq ft tenement (prices vary as per location). The average price of a tenement is Rs 10 lakh. “The central government has already sanctioned Rs 1,000 crore as subsidy for the beneficiaries and around two lakh have already been identified. Since it is a central and state government scheme, there is no fund crunch, unlike in the rest of the real estate market,"" said officials. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Amit will again be contesting for Latur city on a Congress ticket and Dhiraj will contest for the Latur rural seat. While the BJP is attempting to rope in Archanatai Patil Chakurkar, the daughter-in-law of former Congress Union home minister Shivraj Patil, to take on Amit in Latur city, the Shiv Sena has fielded a relative lightweight against Dheeraj. The Congress and NCP have cleared much of the fog involving their candidates’ list in the district, but the BJP is in a fix and is yet to declare its nominee in prestigious Latur city. Archanatai Patil Chakurkar’s name is being considered. The BJP is also facing opposition to several candidates in Latur district — including in the Ausa seat — where it has fielded Abhimanyu Pawar, the CM’s personal assistant. The Ausa seat was traditionally contested by the Shiv Sena. But the seat was exchanged with Latur rural, where the Sena named Sachin Deshmukh, considered a lightweight, to take on Dheeraj.

Kothrud: An urban test bed | Pune News - Times of India,"The Kothrud assembly constituency is the western entry point of Pune city. One junction here alone shows how important this area has become for commuters — 1.6 lakh motorists use Chandani Chowk daily through which two major highways pass: the Pune-Bengaluru highway and the Pune-Mumbai highway. Kothrud has also, over the years, become home for workers travelling to workplaces in Hinjewadi, Kharadi, Yerawada and Magarpatta. Rents are high and so are house prices. In fact, Kothrud, in just under a decade, has become one of the most expensive places in Pune to buy a home in, second only to Koregaon Park. It’s this real estate gold rush that has sparked an unrestrained construction boom. Illegal structures along rivers and nullahs are today a cause for worry across fast developing suburbs such as Balewadi, Bavdhan and Pashan. “Big projects have come up along river banks. The impact of this haphazard construction is felt every year during the monsoon — Ramnadi breaches and there’s no space for floodwater to flow,” said Dushyant Bhatia, a resident of Bavdhan. In August, over 2,000 residents of Vidhate Vasti in Aundh-Baner were evacuated from their shanties after the area was hit by floodwaters from a swollen Ramnadi. “That is going to happen again, unless local leaders and the PMC crack down on builders who have violated important rules,” said Vivek Sonawane, a resident of Aundh. On the ground, there are not many signs of the suggested controls on construction. “Everybody wants a piece of Kothrud,” said Baner resident Pramod Kulkarni. “It is perhaps not more than 15km from any major hub. If done right; if projects such as the Metro take off on time; the ring road is built without destroying the ecology, Kothrud can become a big part of the ‘new Pune’everyone keeps talking about. It’s time we had another posh suburb like Koregaon Park that has good amenities. Kothrud has a real shot here.” Ravindra Sinha, a resident of Baner, said two of the biggest problems in the area are traffic and lack of parking spaces. “The non- implementation of the Development Plan is the reason for the mess in Baner. Road projects that were part of the DP are pending because of land acquisition issues. PMC’s inefficiency is another reason. Building permissions should not be given without implementation of the DP,” Sinha said. Worryingly, the Smart City tag has also failed to bring in equitable development in Balewadi and Aundh. “We continue to have power outages,” said Uma Gadgil, a resident of Balewadi. “The outages first started during the Commonwealth Youth Games that were held in Pune in 2008. Many cables were cut during roadworks ahead of the event. It has been over 10 years since the event, but we still have the same problem with electricity supply.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Kothrud: Quickly finish works on key link routes | Pune News - Times of India,"The proposed Metro route in the constituency can bring some relief to motorists desperately hoping for an end to the congestion here. Two other projects that could potentially ease Kothrud’s enormous congestion are the long-pending riverside road plan and the proposed 2.1km-long Balbharati-Paud Phata link. However, these projects are still a while away. Some are being built; others have not been able to convince environmentalists worried about impact on local ecology. The PMC’s riverside road project was expected to gather momentum after its standing committee had approved a proposal to start acquiring land near the Mhatre bridge in February, 2016. But it hasn’t taken off yet. Local leaders said they had organised numerous demonstrations to push for land acquisition, but claimed the PMC has not moved quick enough. The riverside road at Rajput Vasahat near Erandawane was partly closed recently by citizens who said they are suffering because of the congestion. But the route is important. The connectivity between Karve Road and Sinhagad Road will greatly improve. When completed, the road will also link the area to the Mumbai-Bengaluru and Pune-Ahmednagar highways. It will work as an alternative to Karve Road and, according to authorities, reduce the traffic burden of Sinhagad Road. Residents said the number of congested junctions can be reduced if the road is built. And they are right. The route could ease jams near Rajaram bridge, Mhatre bridge, Santosh hall, Nal Stop, Mehendale garage chowk and Deccan. “The road needs to be laid. It is the need of the hour, especially for those on two-wheelers. The municipal corporation, in my opinion, could even explore the option of an elevated road if there are concerns over river flow and ecology,” said Ameya Nipankar, a resident of Kothrud.

Savitribai Phule Pune University seeks election duty exemption for staffers | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The Savitribai Phule Pune University wrote to the district administration on Monday to exempt senior staffers from poll duty in order to ensure smooth functioning of academic sessions. The university staff will be heading for training this week onwards and the university stated that academic and exam-related work would get hampered if the staff was engaged with election work. The training would be conducted outside the university campus, so the officers would have to travel and spend the entire day there.  The SPPU in its statement said the staff would like to participate in the democratic process of the country, but it was equally important to have the senior staff present at the university for its smooth functioning. The employees of the health and water departments needed to be exempted , the SPPU in its letter informed the administration. A senior university official said, “The university has colleges affiliated in three districts — Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar — and the midterm exams will also begin after the Diwali vacation.

BJP leaders vow to work as team at Chandrakant Patil meet | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Discontent among the BJP's leaders in Kothrud constituency showed signs of easing on Wednesday when top names, including Medha Kulkarni and Muralidhar Mohol, attended a party workers' meet held to promote the candidature of state chief Chandrakant Patil. Kulkarni, the sitting MLA, and Mohol had expressed their displeasure after the BJP picked Patil as its nominee from Kothrud on Tuesday. On Wednesday, however, both shared the dais with Patil. ""There is some sorrow, but it will not prevent us from working for the party,"" said Kulkarni. ""We have not followed the politics of caste. Votes would be sought on the basis of work."" Mohol said leaders would make sure the BJP maintains a lead in the constituency. ""The decision of the party is the final word for us. Kothrud gave a massive lead to Girish Bapat during the Lok Sabha elections. We will repeat that performance,"" he said. Bapat was able to secure a lead of over one lakh votes from Kothrud during the Lok Sabha elections in May. The win made the constituency one of the safest for the BJP and, according to many within the party, a sure fire tactic for Patil. At Wednesday's meet, Patil said he is contesting the election as per directives from party high command. ""It was difficult to accept the decision. When the party leadership declared that I have to contest from Kothrud, it was news for me too,"" he said. He said other candidates' disappointment for not getting the ticket was an obvious reaction. ""But the party will give them their dues. As for me, I don't know how to lose. I don't contest much, but when I do, I don't lose,"" he said.

Ruturaj Patil family evaded Rs 2.84 crore taxes: Tararani Corporators | Kolhapur News - Times of India,"KOLHAPUR: Tararani Aghadi corporators Sunil and Satyajit Kadam have alleged that Congress candidate from Kolhapur South Ruturaj Patil and his other family members for evading property tax worth Rs 2.84 crore. The corporators further alleged that Ruturaj along with his father Sanjay and uncle Satej have cheated the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation by not paying the said tax. Addressing a press conference in Kolhapur Sunil Kadam said, “The Patil family owns a commercial property on old Pune-Bangalore National Highway and they have developed shopping complexes, food mall, theatre, commercial hall and other establishments in the property. When we checked the lease agreements of some of the establishments we found that they are charging huge amount as rent but have not paid property tax to the KMC as per their charges to the tenants.” They alleged that there are more than 50 tenants running shops and commercial establishments in the area. “We have checked the lease agreements of only six establishments and as per the rule of KMC, the Patil family owes Rs 2.84 crore as tax to the KMC from the financial year 2014-15 to 2018-19. The Patil family however has paid Rs 38 lakh per year during these three years. We have written to the KMC commissioner in this regard and has requested him to take action against them as per the rule and book them for cheating KMC,” he said. When TOI contacted Patil family over the allegations, Bhupal Shete, deputy mayor of KMC on their behalf said, “The Mahadik family is fearing defeat of Amal Mahadik and are using such tactics to malign image of our candidate Ruturaj Patil.

"Congress-NCP trying to regain Sangli, BJP-Sena hoping for a clean sweep | Kolhapur News - Times of India","KOLHAPUR: Congress, which considered Sangli as its bastion since the Independence, managed to win only one of the district’s eight seats in the last assembly elections. While the BJP had won four seats, Sena got one and NCP bagged two. This time, Congress and NCP, as a team, are fighting to regain control over Sangli. The BJP-Sena alliance, meanwhile, is determined to increase its tally further. In 2014, BJP had won Shirala, Jath, Miraj and Sangli seats, and it has fielded existing MLAs from these four seats. However, the party is facing rebellion in Shirala and Jath. Sena is contesting the remaining four seats — Khanapur, Islampur, Tasgaon and Palus. Keeping an eye on the Dhangar community voters, BJP had organised Union minister Amit Shah’s rally at Jath. Shah attacked NCP and said party chief Sharad Pawar had failed to address the drought problem in the region over the past 15 years. Shah said BJP is discussing the matter with neighbouring Karnataka and will soon provide water for the drought-prone Jath region. BJP expects this promise of water will help Vilasrao Jagtap retain the Jath seat, where Congress has fielded Vikram Sawant. However, the entry of BJP rebel Ravindra Arali in the poll fray has made the contest interesting. In Shirala Shivajirao Naik is considered a strong BJP candidate, but the rebellion of Samrat Mahadik can affect his chances. NCP has fielded Mansing Naik here. In Sangli city, sitting MLA Sudhir Gadgil helped BJP win in the municipal corporation and has developed a strong network. He is expected to retain the seat. Congress has pitched Prithviraj Patil against Gadgil. Sena’s rebel candidate Shekhar Mane is also in the fray as an independent. In Miraj, BJP’s Suresh Khade is expected to retain the seat, however, Swabhimani Paksha’s Balasaheb Honmare, who has the backing of other parties, is likely to give a tough fight to Khade. Islampur, Kadegaon-Palus and Tasgaon are three important seats that Congress and NCP hold in Sangli district. NCP state president Jayant Patil represents Islampur and Sena has fielded Gaurav Naikawadi, the grandson of freedom fighter Nagnath Naikawadi, against him. BJP’s rebel Nishikant Patil is also contesting as an independent from Islampur. This may provide some relief to Patil. NCP’s Suman Patil is contesting from Tasgaon and will face tough contest as Shiv Sena has pitched Ajit Ghorpade against her. Sharad Pawar had organised a rally at Tasgaon to kickstart Patil’s campaign, indicating the importance of the seat. In Palus-Kadegaon, late Patangrao Kadam’s son Vishwajit Kadam is contesting for the second time and Sena’s Sanjay Vibhute is contesting against Kadam. In Khanapur, Anil Babar is contesting on a Sena ticket and Sadashiv Patil is contesting as an independent. He has received support from Congress and NCP. BJP has continued to weaken Congress and NCP in the district by winning the zilla parishad and Sangli Miraj Kupwad Municipal Corporation. BJP also retained the Sangli Lok Sabha seat in 2019. In comparison, Sena does not have sizable influence in Sangli, except in a few pockets like Khanapur. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra: Former chief ministers’ sons join poll fray to hold on family turfs in Latur | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: All eyes are on the sons of former chief ministers from Latur this election. While former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh’s sons — Amit and Dhiraj — are fighting to hold the family’s sway over Latur, skill development minister and former CM Shivajirao Patil Nilangekar’s grandson Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar is contesting from Nilanga. Dhiraj Deshmukh has joined the poll fray for the first time and is facing Shiv Sena nominee Sachin Deshmukh. The Shiv Sena candidate has not got expected support from BJP workers. In 2014, the seat was contested by BJP’s Ramesh Karad. The BJP has swapped it with Ausa to make room for chief minister’s personal assistant Abhimanyu Pawar, leaving Karad in the lurch. Karad is considered to be a supporter of rural development minister Pankaja Munde. Amit Deshmukh faces a challenge from BJP’s Shailesh Lahoti and the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi nominee Rajasab Maniyar from Latur city. Its a fight between uncle and nephew in Nilanga, where Congress has fielded Ashok Nilangekar, son of late Shivajirao, to take on his nephew Sambhaji. In Udgir constituency, it is a straight fight between BJP’s Anil Kamble, a doctor based in Parbhani, and Sanjay Bansode of the NCP. Bansode made Udgir his second home after losing the 2014 election to BJP’s Sudhakar Bhalerao. Discontent among the BJP workers here has made Kamble’s task a little difficult. In Ausa, Congress has fielded sitting MLA Basavraj Patil against Pawar, who faced strong opposition from BJP and Shiv Sena groups. BJP’s ZP agriculture committee chairman Bajrang Jadhav is contesting as an independent with the backing of Shiv Sena’s Dinkar Mane. Its going to be in interesting triangular fight here. BJP nominee and sitting MLA Vinayakrao Patil, who in 2014 got elected as an independent, faces multi-cornered challenge in Ahmedpur. NCP’s Babasaheb Patil, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Ayodhya Ashok Kendre, and Dilip Deshmukh, who had sought BJP ticket from Amhmedpur.

Shiv Sena’s Aurangabad East workers canvassing for nominee in West | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: Several Shiv Sena workers, who are from the Aurangabad East area — a constituency where BJP has fielded Atul Save — have been found working for Aurangabad West’s Sena candidate Sanjay Shirsath. This has left the BJP leaders fuming. They are now forced to make extra efforts to reach out to voters in Aurangabad East. Shiv Sena, meanwhile, has been upset over the fact that BJP rebel Raju Shinde is contesting against Sena’s Shirsat in Aurangabad West. Some have alleged that the BJP leadership did not try hard enough to convince Shinde to withdraw his nomination. “It is true that several Sena workers in the city are unhappy with Shinde being fielded against the saffron alliance’s official candidate in West. As a result, workers from the Aurangabad East constituency have started working in Aurangabad West to make sure that Sena retains the seat,” MLA Shirsath told TOI. While citing the example of Sena suspending 30 corporators in Nashik for supporting a rebel, Shirsath said that BJP should initiate stringent disciplinary action against Shinde, so that there is no division of votes. There are also allegations that BJP is discreetly helping Shinde’s cause. To further cement their allegations, Sena leaders from Aurangabad West recalled last month’s programme held at Akashwani signal — where Raju Shinde had announced his candidature. The event was attended by senior BJP leaders, including assembly speaker Haribhau Bagde, who openly supported Shinde. The allegations have been refuted by the BJP leadership. They said that Shinde has been made to resign from the party for contesting as an independent. When contacted, BJP spokesperson Shirish Boralkar said, “There are some people who are working against the ‘Yuti Dharm’.

Modi government working in interest of moneybags: Jignesh Mewani | Thane News - Times of India,"THANE: Dalit leader Jignesh Mewani on Wednesday equated the BJP regime with ""power brokers"" working solely in the interest of money-bags, while ignoring the basic needs of the common man. ""The Modi government is aggresively pushing the Rs 90,000 crore bullet train project connecting Mumbai-Ahmedabad. Have they ever considered how people commute from Mumbai to Thane? In fact, had the railways been given these funds it would have completely transformed commute for the common man and each tehsil across the nation would have got rail connectivity,"" Mewani said amidst huge applause from the gathering at Ghaswala Compound in Kausa where he was canvassing for NCP nominee Jitendra Awhad. Mewani, who is an MLA from Gujarat, said the common man is burdened with survival issues and is fighting a loosing battle against rising unemployment, farm suicides and inadequate drinking water but the government is conveniently turning its back on these issues. Equating Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah with 'Duryodhan' and his scheming uncle 'Shakuni"", the famed mythological charachters of Mahabharat, the firebrand Dalit leader said the ploy used by these leaders is to harp on Article 370. ""Will they answer why 16,000 farmers in Maharashtra have committed suicide? Will we ever get to know what happened to the promise of generating employment for two crore people?

BJP working president J P Nadda released the manifesto, or the 'Sankalpapatra', here along with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, state party president Chandrakant Patil and Mumbai unit head Mangal Prabhat Lodha. The manifesto has promised the creation of five crore jobs in the next five years, taking the state's economy to US$1 trillion. It has also assured houses for all by 2022.

Maharashtra: Election commission cracks whip on political ‘campaigns’ on social media | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Political chatter on private WhatsApp groups can now land their administrators in trouble. Messages for or against any political candidate on such groups will be considered in violation of the model code of conduct, election officials said. Under election rules, permission is mandatory from the appropriate authority — the media certification and monitoring committee in this case — for any political advertisements. WhatsApp chats come fall into this category. About four days ago, the administrators of 12 such groups ran afoul of the authorities. The media certification and monitoring committee of Nanded district had issued notices to the administrators under charges of campaigning for a candidate without intimation. “One must take prior permission from ECI before campaigning on any medium — print or electronic — and anyone found campaigning without permission will be in violation of the poll code,” Dilip Shinde, additional chief electoral officer of Maharashtra, told TOI. State election officials said administrators must discourage their group members from telling others on the group to vote for or against a particular candidate. “The same rules apply to Facebook and Twitter,” one official said. Another official said it doesn’t matter whether or not a message is for or against a candidate or a party. “What matters is whether it has the potential to influence voters and was sent without permission from ECI; if yes, then it amounts to poll code violation,” the official said. There have been more than 1,000 complaints statewide on the cVigil app. Screenshots of such messages can be uploaded to the app, an official said. In the Nanded case, the administrators were told to put a stop to such messages and visit the local election office and explain their stand within a week. Offenders will be let off with a warning at first. Subsequent violations will attract harsher penalties, officials said. Election commission teams were monitoring social media for any violations. “Candidates contesting elections will be under the scanner not only physically, but also in cyberspace,” ECI officials said.

"At 82, Madhukar Chavan is oldest candidate in Maharashtra | Aurangabad News - Times of India","AURANGABAD: Former cabinet minister Madhukar Chavan of Congress is the oldest candidate in the fray for upcoming assembly election in Maharashtra. Till the last election, veteran Peasants and Workers Party (PWP) leader and 11-time MLA Ganpatrao Deshmukh (92) from Sangola in Solapur district was the oldest candidate. After Chavan, BJP leader Haribhau Bagde, 75, is the other older candidate in a fray this time. Bagde, who was speaker of the state legislative assembly, is seeking a re-election from Phulambri constituency in Aurangabad district. Chavan, who is seeking the sixth term as an MLA and fifth consecutive victory from Tuljapur assembly constituency in Osmanabad district, had served as a cabinet minister of animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries department and was the deputy speaker of the Maharashtra legislative assembly. Chavan, who began his career as a panchayat samiti member, went on to become an MLA and also served as chairman of Marathwada Development Board, a statutory body. Known for his characteristic ‘dhoti kurta’ attire, the octogenarian Congress leader had secured win from Tuljapur assembly constituency by a margin over 29,400 votes against NCP despite the ‘Modi wave’ in 2014. The BJP candidate had secured a third place. Party workers close to Chavan said the Congressman used to practice wrestling skills during his early age, which is the secret behind his sound health. “Despite being in his 80s, he still leads a very active public life. It is the reason party leadership could not think any name other than Chavan for Tuljapur constituency,” a party worker said. This time, he is pitched against Ranajagjitsinha Patil of BJP, who along with his father and veteran leader Padmsinh Patil, has ditched NCP on the face of election to join the saffron camp. Ranajagjitsinha was keen to contest assembly poll from Osmanabad assembly constituency, but BJP top-brass has pitched him from Tuljapur, which is considered a Congress bastion.

Maharashtra Elections 2019: BJP and Sena seal 162-126 seat deal | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: BJP will contest 162 seats and the Shiv Sena 126, according to the seat-sharing formula for the October 21 assembly elections finalized by the alliance partners on Monday. TOI was the first to report these numbers on September 20. The BJP will give seats from its own quota to smaller allies such as the RPI (Athavale group), the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, Shiv Sangram and Rayat Kranti, it is learnt. This means the Sena’s insistence on a 50-50 formula, with the two saffron partners getting 144 seats each of the total 288, has been junked, and its junking has been accepted by Uddhav Thackeray’s party. The saffron allies had contested the 2014 state polls separately, with the BJP winning 122 seats and the Sena 63. However, the Sena, after having been part of the Devendra Fadnavis government in the state, bargained hard for parity. The BJP though has kept the senior partner tag it snatched from the Sena in 2014, in the wake of its thumping win in this year’s Lok Sabha polls and the nullifying of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Sources said the Sena’s quota includes seats such as Mankhurd, Mulund, Byculla, Mumbadevi, Malegaon, Bhiwandi and perhaps Aurangabad Central, which are supposed to be tough to win for the saffron allies given the large concentration of the minority communities in these areas. Earlier in the evening, the BJP and Sena issued a joint press statement formally announcing the alliance, though no official declaration of the seat-sharing formula was made. The joint statement was signed by state BJP president Chandrakant Patil and senior Sena minister Subhash Desai. The seat-sharing formula will be announced “at the earliest,” the statement said. The cryptic, semi-bureaucratic tone of the Patil-Desai communique was in sharp contrast with the fanfare of the 1990s, when Balasaheb Thackeray and Pramod Mahajan would announce a joint list of candidates at a press conference with elan, and peppered with the Sena patriarch’s stunning one-liners, observers said. Sources in the BJP said the ongoing delay in okaying the final list was a deliberate move by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to leave little time and scope for rebels to play their cards. BJP-Sena strategists are worried that a formal announcement of party candidates in advance may trigger rebellion and even defections. Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray held parleys with senior party colleagues at Matoshree amid talk that the BJP would not accept Matoshree’s 50-50 seat-sharing formula. Fadnavis was in New Delhi for two days to consult the BJP high command on the alliance with the Sena and the final list of party candidates. He attended the BJP’s Parliamentary board meeting with a couple of state BJP leaders in tow. The BJP is reportedly ready to offer the deputy CM’s post to Aaditya Thackeray in a bid to assuage the Sena, which is finding it tough to accept its No. 2 position in the alliance, sources said. Sources added that the BJP may compensate the Sena by giving it two or three seats in the legislative council. “In the 1990s, the BJP would be pleading with Balasaheb for more seats. Twenty years later, it’s the Sena which is at the BJP’s mercy,” said a Sena veteran. Aaditya Thackeray will contest from Worli, the central Mumbai fiefdom of Sachin Ahir who recently snapped ties with the NCP to join the Sena. Ahir is likely to be given a berth in the state legislative council next year, it is learnt. The joint BJP-Sena statement said, “In the last five years, the Mahayuti worked together under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis and the guidance of Uddhav Thackeray and is now once again going in for another state election. Through joint discussions, Thackeray, Fadnavis and other leaders of the allied parties have unanimously decided to have an alliance. Thus, the Mahayuti is being announced.” At the BJP state headquarters, Patil said the list of candidates will be announced in New Delhi, and the forms A and B for nominations have already been sent to homes of candidates.

Maharashtra: Bouncers in demand among candidates looking to impress | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: With the assembly poll campaign entering the last phase, the demand for bouncers has touched an all-time high in the region. Candidates, as well as star campaigners visiting the region, are hiring well-built youths as bouncers, who, apart from acting as private security guards, also add to the photo quotient and status of the VIPs they surround. With an increasing number of gyms in the city, the number of bouncers too has shot up in the past few years. As on date, there are well over 200 bouncers in the city and they are making some fast money during the polling season. Body builders who have experience in providing bouncers for events are reaching out to gyms to hire youths with good height and visible built. The candidates confess that having bouncers, apart from security reasons, is also a means of impressing the voters. Congress-sponsored candidate Yusuf Mukati and Samajwadi Party’s Kaleem Qureshi are some of the candidates who can be seen with bouncers surrounding them. Even some mainstream party leaders are seen with local bouncers during their trips to the city. A candidate, who has hired four bouncers, said, “When you reach out to the voters, they should be impressed. Having bouncers accompanying you is one of the ways of impressing voters.” Qazi Kafeel Ahmed, who provides bouncers to major event management firms in the city, said, “During the elections, the charges for bouncer services go up. Depending on the physique, a bouncer can be paid anything between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 a day.” Another body builder, Noel Torres said that in Aurangabad, bouncers get work for 40 to 50 days, which includes polls or visit of celebrities. “Apart from regularly going to the gym, one has to be discipline and have a proper diet,” said Nishant Jamadar, who is preparing for a body building competition and says that he is open to doubling up as a bouncer.

Presiding officer Milind Borikar, the Mumbai collector, called a special general body meeting on Thursday and formally announced them elected. ""I have set my eyes on improvement of basic civic facilities, along with pushing for big ticket projects like Metro, cluster redevelopment and new station among others,"" Mhaske told reporters after his anointment. Since Sena commands a majority in the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), both posts went to the party. Mhaske took the reins from party colleague Meenakshi Shinde, and Kadam ascended the seat vacated by Diva corporator R Madhavi. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya congratulated the two and thanked the residents of Thane for their continued support. The bonhomie between local Sena and NCP leaders was apparent on Thursday as Congress and NCP leaders made a beeline to meet Thackeray. NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad drove to meet Thackeray, and shared the stage with Sena strongman Eknath Shinde, who addressed the assembled public outside the TMC headquarters. It is learnt that NCP refrained from putting up a candidate reportedly at the behest of Shinde on the day of filing nominations.

Maharashtra: Uddhav Thackeray says he foiled Sharad Pawar’s plan to destabilise government | Kolhapur News - Times of India,"KOLHAPUR: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday addressed a rally in Jaisingpur to campaign for Sena candidate Ulhas Patil from Shirol assembly constituency. Targeting NCP Sharad Pawar at the rally, Thackeray said Pawar was in the habit of playing politics. He said Pawar wanted to destabilise the new government by extending unconditional support to BJP after the 2014 assembly elections. “However, I foiled his (Pawar’s) plans by joining the government,” he said. “Five years ago, even before the poll results were clear, Pawar extended unconditional support to BJP. But now he claims that he will not rest until he has driven us out of power. I had foiled his earlier intention to destabilise the newly-formed government in 2014. I ensured that the government remains stable for five years,” said Thackeray. The Sena also targeted the rebels contesting against the Sena candidates. Against Ulhas Patil, Anil Yadav of BJP is contesting on a Jan Surajya Shakti Party ticket. Sena is contesting eight of the 10 assembly seats and has given ticket to six sitting MLAs. The BJP turncoats are either contesting on JSSP tickets or as independent candidates. The Sena candidates had complained about BJPto Thackeray a week ago. “We have united under the saffron flag. We don’t like traitors. If they want a fight, let it be direct. There are some parasites. They appear during the election, and this is the time to cut them off,” said Thackeray. He agreed that there were some differences between the Sena and BJP in running the government. “We had differences over farmers’ issues. But thise have been resolved,” he said and added, “We have a strong alliance. People should not vote for the rebels.” Thackeray added that the Ram temple must be built. To the critics of the Shiv Sena manifesto, Thackeray asked, “What is wrong in providing food at Rs 10? Why you criticising? I will even cook to feed the poors.” Responding to BJP’s manifesto, Thackeray said, “I thank the BJP. The demand for Bharat Ratnas for Mahatma Phule and Savarkar will now be fulfilled.” Talking about the recent floods that ravaged the region, the Sena chief apologised for his absence during relief works. “Due to severe back ache, I could now come to Kolhapur during the floods.

Studio owner Chandrarao Kadam, who wanted to provide outdoor locations for Bombay’s film-makers, bought the property in 1940, but it took him almost four years to clear and level the forested land. Today, his youngest son, Kiran Kadam (78), looks back Chandivali’s metamorphosis. “We did not even have a proper approach road to the studio in those days. The roads were flooded almost every monsoon. But there were very few such locations available to shoot films,” says Kadam's wife, Rohini. Lodged between Saki Naka and Powai, Chandivali has developed into one of the city’s most expensive neighbourhoods, characterised by tall residential highrises and an emerging IT hub. Its proximity to the premier IIT-Bombay is another reason why it is sought-after by startups. While Chandivali and Hiranandani Powai have had a rapid growth story, the neighbouring industrial units on Khairani Road and slums in Kurla, which falls under the same assembly constituency, stand in stark contrast. Residents in this largely neglected locality complain of deplorable living conditions and lack of basic amenities, including an accessible healthcare system. The slums are so densely populated that inadequate ventilation is a hazard for most residents. “Fresh air does not reach the slums, leave alone the small houses,” said Ramzan Chaudhury, a social activist from the area who is now affiliated to AIMIM. While bungalows and hotels have sprung up in the area, lakhs of residents continue to be neglected, said Chaudhury. Neglect is such that a bridge is yet to be rebuilt after it was brought down in March, said Iftikar Khan who runs an industrial unit. “This is not only increasing commute time for over 50,000 people, including students from four to five schools, but is also a risk during floods as it is over a roadside nullah. By contrast, another bridge brought down in Ghatkopar was quickly replaced,” said Khan. Chandivali became an assembly constituency only in 2009. It has the highest number of voters—around 3.8 lakh—in the city but their turnout has been dismal in the past two elections at 43-44%. Congress' candidate and four-time MLA Arif (Naseem) Khan continues to be a strong contender, though it remains to be seen how Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and AIMIM will impact his votes. “Even if candidates from these parties do not stand a chance against Khan, they are likely to leave a slight dent in his vote bank,” said an activist in Saki Naka. Khan's toughest contender is Shiv Sena's Dilip Lande, whom he defeated in the 2009 polls by a huge margin of 33,715 votes. Lande was then an MNS candidate. Khan polled 73,141 votes in 2014 and defeated another Sena candidate, Santosh Singh, again by a respectable margin. In the Lok Sabha elections this year, Poonam Mahajan from the BJP had enjoyed a lead in the constituency, indicating a shift in choice. Though Khan is confident about his winning margin rising in the upcoming polls, anti-incumbency may make it tougher for him, said one of his supporters. For Khan, the long-pending rehabilitation plan of over 12,000 families living in the slums adjoining the international airport, will remain a priority if he wins. “It is also a security threat to the city. A couple of months ago, a person breached the airport security and entered the runway area after climbing the boundary wall. These slum residents need to be rehabilitated,” Khan told TOI. He said a building built for rehabilitating these residents is lying unused for over a decade. Residents of slums closer to Mithi river are awaiting rehabilitation too. Despite the largest voter base, the constituency does not have a government hospital. Sena’s Lande has not only promised a hospital, but also an open ground and wider roads. Some voters from Hiranandani and Chandivali highrises may choose Lande due to Shiv Sena’s alliance with BJP. MNS’ Sumeet Baraskar is likely to eat into some of the Marathi votes from Sena.

Maharashtra assembly polls: Nearly 80% candidates in fray lose deposits | Nashik News - Times of India,"PUNE, NASHIK, KOLHAPUR, AURANGABAD: BJP nominee Gopichand Padalkar, who contested against NCP’s Ajit Pawar in Baramati, lost face on the result day when he could not save the deposit he paid to contest the election. Just four months ago, when Padalkar had contested on a VBA ticket, he had garnered nearly 3lakh votes. He was among many party nominees and independents, making over 80% of the total candidates in the fray, who lost their security deposits in the assembly election by failing to garner one-sixth of the total valid votes polled in their respective constituencies. In 2014 too, almost 83% of the candidates had lost their deposit. In some constituencies, even candidates from prominent political parties, including Congress, MNS and VBA, were not immune. Sitting Congress MLA D S Ahire from Sakri, and Kaizer Azad, the Congress nominee from Sillod, are in the same list. The results have revealed that there was a straight fight between the candidates of the two big alliances. As a result, even the candidates placed third could not save their deposit in many constituencies. In Nashik, third-spot holders not safeThe North Maharashtra region — spread across Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule and Jalgaon districts — had 221 candidates competing for 35 seats. As many as 171 of them lost their deposits. In Nashik district alone, 118 of the 148 candidates, across 15 constituencies, lost security deposits. The list includes former MLA Nitin Bhosale, who was contesting from Nashik Central on MNS ticket. Sitting BJP MLA Devayani Pharande was re-elected here. Dilip Datir, former Sena corporator contesting from Nashik West on MNS nomination, too lost his deposit. BJP’s Seema Hiray emerged winner here. In adjoining Jalgaon district, third-placed contestants in only three assembly segments — Chopda, Raver and Chalisgaon — could save their deposits. In the remaining eight constituencies, barring the winners and runners-up, all others lost money. In all, 86 of the 111 candidates in the district lost deposits. In Nandubar district, 21 out of 30 candidates in four assembly segments lost deposit. Only in Nawapur, the candidate placed third could save the deposit. Dhule also scripted a similar story with third-spot candidate in Dhule city getting his deposit back. All others lost their money. In Kolhapur, voting percentage has an impactThe high voting percentage, coupled with tough contests in Kolhapur, saw 78 of the 106 candidates lose their deposits. In eight of the 10 constituencies here, there was a tough fight between the candidates from Shiv Sena-BJP alliance and Congress-NCP combine. Voters in these constituencies put their faith in candidates from the major political parties. Ichalkaranji and Hatkanangle had the highest number of candidates losing their deposits (12 each), followed by Radhanagari (10). Prominent deposit losers include independent candidates Arun Dongle and Rahul Desai, and VBA nominee Jeevan Patil. Even Rahul Khanjire, a Congress candidate from Ichalkaranji, lost his money. Sena-BJP and MIM picks safe in Aurangabad cityAlmost 85% of the candidates from Aurangabad district lost their deposit. In all, 133 candidates contested from the nine assembly constituencies of the district and 113 lost their deposits. In all the three constituencies covering Aurangabad city, except for the BJP-Shiv Sena and AIMIM candidates, everyone lost their deposits. In Aurangabad East, of the 34 candidates in fray, 32, including Congress-sponsored candidate Yusuf Mukati and Samajwadi Party’s Kaleem Qureshi lost their deposit. In Aurangabad Central, of the 14 candidates who contested, a dozen failed to get their deposits back. This included NCP candidate Syed Abdul Qadeer, VBA’s Amit Bhuigad and CPI’s Adv Abhay Taksal. In Aurangabad West, of the 12 candidates, nine, including VBA’s Sandeep Shirsath, lost the deposit. In Sillod, after Congress strongman Abdul Sattar switched over to Sena, Congress candidate Kaisar Azad failed to secure his deposit. Out of the seven candidates here, five lost their deposits. In Phulambri, represented by assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagde, of the 13 candidates, 11 lost their deposits. Eight candidates contested from Kannad constituency, and five of them lost money. In Gangapur, 14 candidates contested, and 12 lost their deposits. In Vaijapur, 16 contested, while 14 lost their deposits. Even in Paithan, of the 15 candidates, 13 had to let go of the deposits All except winners and runners-up in Pune lose deposit Only 41 contestants of the 246 in the fray from 21 assembly segments in Pune city and rural succeeded in securing their deposits. The remaining 205 candidates — about 83% of the total number of contestants — lost their security deposits. In most seats in Pune city, barring the winner and the runner-up, all other candidates lost their deposits. In contrast, in Pune rural, Junnar and Khed Alandi constituencies stood out as exceptions wherein independent candidates secured sizable votes which helped them secure their deposits. In Junnar, Shiv Sena rebel Asha Buchake, who had contested as an independent, gained over 50,000 votes and in Khed Alandi, BJP rebel and independent candidate Atul Deshmukh bagged over 53,000 votes. Vote shares of both candidates were above the benchmark of one-sixth of total valid votes. All VBA candidates in Pune city and rural areas — as many as 18 of them — lost their deposits. Except in Kothrud, even MNS failed to garner adequate votes in all other seats including Kasba Peth, Shivajinagar, Khadakwasla and Hadapsar. Firoz Mulla, in fray as an independent from Shivajinagar, lost his deposit. Mulla said he had contested with a cause and securing the deposit was not his aim. “Independent candidates are aware that they have a limited reach and restricted vote base. For them, fighting an election has more importance,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra BJP is afraid of losing, says Sharad Pawar | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said the state BJP leadership is afraid it will lose the election and hence want the Union leaders to woo voters. Pawar said the state’s plans of opening up the forts for tourism were wrong. The state governmnet had mooted such a plan.  “The forts are a testimony to the valour of our forefathers. They will now be converted into bars and dance bars, if they will be opened for tourism. The ruling government should think what direction they want to steer the state in,” he said. “If the people are with you, why is the Prime Minister at eight rallies and the Union home minister at 20 rallies in the state?” Pawar said. He was speaking at an election rally at Hadapsar constituency. He said many big announcements made by the state like building a memorial to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj or Babasaheb Ambedkar have remained on paper. The government is giving hollow promises and busy demanding answers from those who were in the government before them instead of presenting the works they have done, he said. “The BJP, which has in power in the state and the Centre, is now asking us what we have done in the past. The efforts that we have taken have helped keeping the state united. Our initiatives like reservation as well as implementation of Mandal commission have given voice to deprived classes and women,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Entire Nashik Sena unit quits over candidature of BJP MLA | Nashik News - Times of India,"NASHIK: The entire Nashik city unit of the Shiv Sena, including all 36 party corporators in the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and over 350 office-bearers, resigned on Tuesday in protest against the candidature of sitting BJP MLA Seema Hiray in the Nashik West seat. The Sena corporators and office-bearers openly declared that they would rally behind Vilas Shinde, the Sena leader who is contesting as an independent from the seat. “All 36 Sena corporators have decided to resign from the NMC. We have sent a jointly signed letter to party chief Uddhav Thackeray intimating him about our decision,” said Ajay Boraste, senior Sena functionary and leader of the opposition in the NMC. Boraste was addressing the media on Tuesday along with the Sena corporators and other top party leaders in the city. Shinde was also present. Boraste claimed that even Sena office-bearers were in the process of handing over their resignation letters to the party’s chief coordinator, Bhausaheb Chowdhari. “We are resigning to prevent any disciplinary action against us by the high command as we will not work for the BJP candidate in Nashik West. We have decided to violate the alliance dharma between the Sena and BJP in the constituency,” Boraste said. The Nashik West seat should have gone to the Sena as it was one of the party’s bastions, Boraste said. “As many as 22 of our corporators are from Nashik West. BJP should have understood the ground reality and left the seat for us. We are apprehensive about the victory of the BJP from this seat,” he said. Shinde said Hiray had been incapable of developing the constituency over the last five years. “The Sena needs to contest the polls from this seat to keep its base strong. If we do not fight from here, our party’s presence will be hugely diminished,” he argued. There is apprehension among a section of the BJP leaders that the belligerence of the Sena would not only pose problems for Hiray but could also have a fallout in two other constituencies, Nashik East and Nashik Central, where BJP candidates are in the fray. Recently, BJP leaders were upset after Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut met Balasaheb Sanap, who is contesting as an NCP candidate from Nashik East after being denied a ticket by the BJP though he is the sitting MLA. BJP leaders had said the Sena was sending wrong signals by meeting Sanap. City BJP chief Girish Palve questioned why the Sena corporators had tendered their resignations to their party chief chief and not to the municipal commissioner. “A Sena candidate was in the fray in Nashik West in 2014 but the BJP still won the seat. We are confident of Hiray’s victory again,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Men toil hard in planning strategies for their wives contesting Maharashtra assembly elections | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: From managing the home front to boosting morale and even planning poll strategies, husbands of some women candidates in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad are going all out to ensure easy victory for their better halves in the state polls. There are about 13 women contesting from 11 constituencies in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate from Kasba Peth constituency Mukta Tilak had to least bother about preparing her nomination papers as her husband, Shailesh Tilak, took care of all the legal aspects. “From preparing affidavits to raising funds for the campaigning, we have been managing and coordinating between the party and our candidate to ensure that no stone is left unturned,” Mukta’s husband, Shailesh, said. Shailesh said women candidates being the face of their parties could not be left alone to deal with all the paperwork. “In such a situation, we handle the back-end process and strategize to ensure that women candidates concentrate only on the campaigning part,” he added. Chandrakant Desale, an industrial worker, has taken a break from work for the last leg of campaigning for his wife, Chayawati, who is contesting on the Shetkari Kamgar Paksha ticket from the Chinchwad constituency. Chayawati said her entry into politics could only be possible because of her husband. “He supported me right from the beginning. With the campaigning at its peak now, he takes care of the children, 15-year old daughter and eight-year-old son, so I can focus on the elections,” she said, adding that her husband wanted her to be the voice of women in the area and address issues faced by them in the industrial township. Nitin Kadam, husband of Ashwini Kadam contesting from Parvati constituency, said being a veteran himself in the field, he guided Ashwini initially. Ashwini, a school teacher, went on to become three-time corporator from Parvati. “Initially, I had to guide her through many things, but now she has become so seasoned that we take guidance from her,” Nitin said. From handling her social media campaign to strategizing each day’s padyatras in the constituency, Nitin said he had been managing every bit to ensure that his wife reached out to every voter. From Maval, Bahujan Samajwadi Party candidate Mandakini Bhosale termed her husband the guiding force and pillar of support. “My husband is a retired officer and he does all the planning and publicity for my campaigns,” Mandakini said, as her husband, Shashikant Bhosale, added that Mandakini had done some great social work in the area and would definitely bring some development if elected.

Sonia Gandhi must hold CWC poll for new leadership: Former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan | Pune News - Times of India,"Former CM Prithviraj Chavan entered politics on Rajiv Gandhi's request. But his family was known to be Nehru-Gandhi loyalists for long, with father Anandrao and mother Premalakaki both representing the Karad Lok Sabha constituency on Congress tickets. Chavan, a three-time LS MP from Karad, was minister of state in the PMO. During his four-year tenure as CM from 2010, he was known as 'Mr Clean' , but it was also during this period that relations between Congress and NCP soured. Currently, Chavan is the only prominent Congress leader who has kept the party alive in NCP-dominated western Maharashtra. His followers say his personality is his biggest asset, which will ensure his victory in the assembly elections for the Karad South seat in Satara district. Excerpts... There is a clamour for restructuring of Congress following two successive debacles in LS elections. Rahul Gandhi has resigned. Doesn't the party need to introspect at the organizational and ideological levels? There is no need for any introspection at the ideological level. Congress has firm and strong ideological roots, which are time-proven. As far as organizational restructuring is concerned, Sonia Gandhi has agreed to hold the post of party president as a stopgap arrangement. She should conduct an election for the Congress Working Committee (CWC) at the earliest, which can see the emergence of a new leadership. Your party colleague, Sushilkumar Shinde, has said both Congress and NCP are ""tired"" and ""exhausted"". He is in favour of the two parties merging... I don't want to comment on this, but the statement is unfortunate. One must remember that NCP was formed after the issue of leading Congress at the national level came up. But since then, the two parties have developed a working relationship. You had an opportunity to fight the Satara Lok Sabha bypoll, but decided to contest the assembly elections instead. Why? The offer to contest the LS bypoll was made by Sharad Pawar, who had also talked to Sonia Gandhi about it. Meanwhile, a meeting of Congress workers in Karad turned into a referendum that I should contest the assembly elections. I told Pawar that I was unfamiliar with three assembly segments in the Satara LS constituency, which were represented by NCP...When Ajit Pawar resigned, the proposal was withdrawn. I guess somebody must have asked why the party should give up the seat to Congress. I had suggested that Pawar himself contest the bypoll, but he was not ready. It is said that you had taken a strong decision about irregularities in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank, which soured the relationship between Congress and NCP. What happened? Then RBI governor Raghuram Rajan had called me saying there was a problem with the bank. I suggested that the RBI send its officials to have joint meetings with state cooperative officials. MSC Bank was functioning without an RBI licence for the past 50 years and the cooperative department had ignored this. I decided to apply for a licence for the bank, but was told that any institution incurring losses or having negative worth cannot be granted one. The bank had by then accumulated losses of Rs 11,000 crore. As I was keen to save the bank, Rajan suggested that I supersede the board of directors... I appointed two administrators. The bank made profits of Rs 700 crore within three years. However, all these developments were interpreted politically. Several Congress leaders were keen on having an alliance with Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). How do you expect these parties to perform? It is a fact that VBA's performance affected Congress in the LS elections. Prakash Ambedkar's social engineering theory of bringing together Dalits, Muslims and OBCs had the potential of destabilising the political foundation. But it did not happen. VBA's performance will not be like what it was during the LS polls. About MNS, I feel no political space can accommodate two parties with the same ideology. I also believe that no political trend continues for long. BJP might have won the LS polls, but the assembly election results will be different. We have examples like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the recent past. Your name came up as a possi- ble AICC president when Rahul Gandhi resigned. Is that true? Nothing of that sort happened. Nobody asked me anything nor did I talk to anyone on the issue. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra assembly elections: Former Mumbai police chief lends helping hand to encounter cop | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: BJP Lok Sabha member and former Mumbai police commissioner Satya Pal Singh on Sunday campaigned for encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma, who is contesting the assembly elections from Nalasopara as a Shiv Sena candidate against Bahujan Vikas Aghadi's Kshitij Thakur, a sitting legislator. ""I was in Mumbai for two days, I though I must campaign for Sharma, who has worked with me when I was deputy commissioner, additional commissioner and joint commissioner in Mumbai. I participated in a road show for Sharma. I am sure, in view of the impressive performance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, it should not be difficult for Sharma to wrest the seat,'' Singh told TOI. An IPS officer of the 1980 batch, Singh took voluntary retirement from service on January 31, 2014, and jumped into electoral politics. He joined BJP and contested from Baghpat in UP. He defeated veteran Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh by a margin of 2.09 lakh votes, while in 2019, he was re-elected, but with a reduced margin. He won by 23,502 votes by defeating RLD's Jayant Choudhary. ""Campaigning in Thane district was a refreshing experience, as ever since I quit IPS, my visits to Mumbai have been reduced. BJP and Sena's performance will be impressive. I also campaigned in Mumbai and Pune during my two-day visit to Maharashtra,'' Singh said on Tuesday. Sharma joined the state police force as a sub-inspector in 1983 and took voluntary retirement on September 13, 2019. He was joining BJP, but joined Sena when he did not succeed. In his sworn affidavit, he declared assets worth more than Rs 36 crore (including that of his wife Swikriti). While Sharma owns movable assets worth Rs 1.8 crore, he does not possess immovable assets, as per the affidavit. His wife has movable assets worth Rs 14 crore and immovable assets worth more than Rs 20 crore. Sharma and his wife have shown a combined liability of over Rs 15 crore, of which nearly Rs 15 crore is that of his wife, whose profession has been given as 'business'.

"NCP and Congress leaders from Pune, rural areas with local vote base join BJP days before polling | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has continued with its strategy to induct Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress leaders from Pune city and rural areas ahead of voting day to dent their plans of bouncing back with wins. Those who joined the BJP camp in the last two weeks are mostly local leaders who have sizeable vote bases in smaller areas. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis wants a repeat of 2014 where all the eight seats in Pune city were bagged by the BJP and a victory in all the seats the party is contesting in rural areas. The inductions began two weeks ago when senior Congress leaders Sadanand Shetty and Mukari Algude joined the BJP in the presence of Fadnavis. The latest addition came on Monday night when NCP’s former MLA from Wadgaon Sheri, Bapu Pathare, switched over to the BJP. Sources from the BJP camp in Pune said some more leaders from the opposition parties are expected to join the party in the next two days ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s public rally in the city on Thursday. Pathare’s move came as a surprise for the NCP leaders as he was present at NCP leader Ajit Pawar’s road show in Wadgaon Sheri in the afternoon. However, he switched sides in the evening by joining the BJP’s sitting MLA Jagdish Mulik who was on his way to Mumbai to meet Fadnavis. Pathare has a significant following in Wadgaon Sheri and his change of party may put Mulik in a safe position. Leaders from the NCP and the Congress claimed that defections will not make any difference and the parties will not lose votes. A senior leader from NCP said, “Pathare’s move was unfortunate but it will not affect the prospects of Sunil Tingre, the party’s candidate from Wadgaon Sheri. Thousands of party workers had assembled outside Tingre’s house on Monday night and on Tuesday to express their support to him. They have resolved to work harder,” the leader said. A BJP functionary said inductions of NCP and Congress leaders into the BJP clearly indicates that all is not well in the opposition’s camp. They said the BJP is in a commanding position and will win all the seats in the city. The rural areas also saw some leaders joining the BJP. The NCP’s former district unit president Jalindar Kamthe and former chairman of Pune Zilla Parishad Pradeep Kand have been actively campaigning for the Baburao Pacharane, the BJP’s Shirur candidate. Sources from the BJP’s city unit said the party’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Kakade has been steering the induction of the opposition leaders. Kakade played a vital role in the induction of Shetty and Algude. While Shetti has a sizeable backing in Pune Cantonment, Algude has a vote base in Shivajinagar.

"Surge in fake news seen in build-up to elections in India, says fact-check team | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The URL shares of articles based on fraudulent data (junk science) were the most on Facebook in April (during the Lok Sabha election) followed by those full of hate, clickbait (content whose main purpose is to attract attention and encourage visitors to click on a link to a particular web page), satire, and that of political support. The world's largest fact-checking team for credibility assessment of shares on social media - UK-based Logically - has revealed these facts ahead of the state assembly polls slated for October 21. Its survey report 'Case study: Misinformation and the Indian election', released recently, has thus flagged a sign of caution for crores of voters in Maharashtra and Harayana, who will take part in the democratic exercise. Logically monitored 3,836 websites, 174 of which were from mainstream media sources and 3,662 from fringe outlets. It analysed almost 10 lakh English articles published between April 1 and 30, 2019 on these websites, of which 33,897 were found completely fake. However, 85% of English news reported in Indian media didn't contain any factual inaccuracies, the report stated. Though there were a large number of reliable articles that were published by various websites, fakes, satire, extreme bias and hate were mainly among the non-reliable contents published by these websites and later shared by people on social media. However, the shares shows people sharing more junk science and hateful messages ahead of elections. Logically not only exposed this misinformation and rumors, but after fact-checking them, quickly reacted to correct the information thus avoiding conflict. The company has its offices in UK, US and India. Historically, turnout in Lok Sabha polls has been around 55% but 2019 saw the highest-ever, 67.4%. it also saw a rise in female voters. Also voters' access to smartphones changed from 21% in 2014 to 39% in 2019, almost a 100% rise. According to Lyric Jain, the 23-year-old CEO of Logically, the effects of misinformation in India should not be underestimated. ""One need simply look at the widely-reported spate of mob vigilante killings that occurred over an 18-month period between mid-2018 and the start of 2019 to see the real effects of rumor and falsehood. Nicknamed the 'WhatsApp lynchings', often the killings were a direct result of rumours of child abductions which spread over the messaging platform to rural communities.

"Maharashtra elections: Switching sides, Navi Mumbai satrap says 'did it for children' | Navi Mumbai News - Times of India","For close to three decades, Ganesh Naik's writ ran over Navi Mumbai, his control over the municipal corporation stretching back to its inception in 1995. He even holds the record for the all-time highest and second highest victory margins in the Maharashtra assembly elections. Such was his clout that the late Dhirubhai Ambani once publicly predicted that Naik, then a group leader of the Shiv Sena in the legislative assembly, would be the future chief minister of the state. However, a shock defeat in the 2014 polls has robbed Naik of his invincible aura. A leader of the indigenous Agri community, he is now fighting to stay relevant amidst the emergence of new challengers in the satellite township. His entry into the BJP along with his sons ahead of the polls was perceived as an opportunistic shift though it did not lend him the bargaining power that he held in the Congress-NCP regime or even in the Shiv Sena. Naik was denied a ticket for the 2019 assembly polls from the Belapur seat notwithstanding the fact that no politician in recent times had made as flamboyant an entry into a party with such a large contingent of supporters, which included 48 corporators. Instead, BJP handed out his son Sandeep a ticket for the Airoli constituency, which Naik junior then chose to pass on to his father. At his 'White House' office on the Thane Belapur road, where Naik holds his 'darbar', he chooses to disregard the slight. ""It's hardly a few days since I joined BJP, how much do I expect in this short period?"" What made it look more embarrassing for Naik-and which he does not mention-was the BJP declaring the candidature of his understudy and now rival Manda Mhatre from his pocketborough Belapur. Naik, who admits that he had no compelling reason to exit the NCP, says Sharad Pawar gave him a free hand in handling party work in Navi Mumbai and Thane and he had no complaints against him or the late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray. ""Balasaheb called me up several times to give me his blessings even after I exited Sena,"" says Naik. The circumstances of his entry into BJP, Naik points out, was partly dictated by the thought of securing his children's future. ""I never wanted to leave NCP, but I did not want my children to blame me later for creating a hindrance to their career or ambitions. Besides, all my colleagues wanted me to join the BJP for the sake of development."" Seeking to dispel the view that he had sacrificed his son's interests by opting to contest from Airoli, Naik said this too was not his own decision. ""My children forced me to contest. They felt that I had done 80 per cent of the work and I needed to complete the remaining 20 per cent, and that they had time to complete their 80 per cent,"" said Naik. His only regret, he says, as he readies to contest under a new banner is the fact that the slum development policy for Navi Mumbai is yet to be finalised and so is the scheme for regularizing gaothan expansion. Though for now he may have to defer to BJP leaders in the state and region who may be junior to him, Naik seems confident that he would soon be back in control in Navi Mumbai. He has grandiose plans for the city: it can be the next Singapore in 10 years, he says. And he is clued into policy-making. For instance, Cidco's plan to create affordable housing stock on plots reserved for parking and other amenities has drawn criticism from experts who say it will lead to traffic congestion. But Naik backs CIDCO on it saying, ""NMMC will soon launch the elevated parking concept at various locations to decongest the city."" Aware of the environment concerns of voters, he says mangroves can be meticulously transplanted using modern technology. The only issues on which Naik refuses to dwell on are issues of the past which include his role in quarrying. For a man who started his career as a labour leader and joined Shiv Sena at age 16, Naik has come a long way. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Maharashtra assembly polls: Sharad Pawar scores over Vikhe Patil in Ahmednagar | Nashik News - Times of India,"NASHIK: NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s special focus in Ahmednagar and a divided NDA in that district scripted UPA’s stupendous performance in the assembly polls. By inflicting this humiliation on NDA in Ahmednagar, Pawar has proved to his arch political foe and the state BJP minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil that he is still a force to reckon with in that district. Vikhe Patil, who played a crucial role in scripting the victories of his son Sujay (from BJP) in Ahmednagar city and Sadashiv Lokhande (of Sena) from Shirdi in the parliamentary polls, had claimed that NDA would sweep all the 12 seats in the district in the assembly elections. “The score would be NDA 12 and UPA 0 in the district,” he had claimed in the run-up to the polls. However, once the results were announced it was amply clear that voters threw their weight behind Pawar rather than Vikhe Patil. NCP won six seats, Congress two and NCP-backed Shetkari Krantikari Party won one seat. On the other hand, BJP managed to win three and Sena could not open its account. In 2014, BJP had won five seats and Sena one. The Congress-NCP had won the remaining six. Significantly, five NDA heavyweights, like Ahmednagar guardian minister Ram Shinde (BJP), Shivaji Kardile (BJP), Viabhav Pichad (BJP), Vijayrao Aute (Sena) and Anil Rathord (Sena) were rejected by the voters. The first four were sitting MLAs and Rathod was a five-time legislator from Ahmednagar city. “The NCP and Congress fought this election with utmost sincerity under the guidance of Pawar, who personally took inputs from us. It had a tough challenge since the UPA had lost both the seats in the district in the Lok Sabha polls. And later, many of the senior leaders, including sitting MLAs, deserted the UPA and joined the NDA. But UPA’s rank and file rose to the occasion and gave a befitting lesson to the NDA,” NCP district president Rajendra Phalke told TOI. NCP leaders recalled Pawar was so determined to have UPA win the polls in Ahmednagar — to teach Vikhe Patil a lesson — that of all rallies that he addressed in the state, most (8) were in Ahmednagar. These rallies worked wonders with the voters, especially the farmers’ fraternity spread across 12 seats. Phalke said NCP leadership decided to field young candidates against the NDA heavyweights in many of these constituencies. In the other seats, experienced leaders were given the tickets. “This experiment with a blend of youth and experience worked well. Six of our candidates that won against the NDA heavyweights were in the age group of 35-40. These young candidates slogged hard and triumphed,” added Phalke. NCP did some social engineering to retain its Akole seat, where its sitting MLA Vaibhav Pichad defected to BJP and contested the polls. “NCP gave the ticket to a BJP ZP member and Pichad’s bitter political rival Kiran Lahamate in Akole seat. He was irked with BJP for bringing in Pichad and giving him the ticket. Lahamate went all out and won that seat,” added Phalke. The BJP-Sena camp in Ahmednagar is apparently stunned by the poll results, and many have started raising questions about whether the party was prudent in inducting “outsiders” right from the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. “We are getting feedback that the outsiders who were brought into the party were counter-productive. Our cadres were dejected and it gave wrong signals to the voters. Moreover, the feedback we are getting from various constituencies is that Vikhe Patil’s loyalists, who are still in Congress, did not throw their weight behind NDA candidates, as they had done during Lok Sabha polls,” claimed a senior BJP district functionary. Both Ram Shinde and BJP district chief Bhanudas Berhad said that post mortem of the poll debacle would be done after Diwali. Vikhe Patil could not be contacted despite attempts, but one of his loyalist in Ahmednagar city admitted that in many of seats, they worked for UPA’s victory since assembly polls are fought on local issues, which the present government failed to address.

All in the family: ‘Beta-beti’ brigade proves blood is thicker than voter | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: With each election Maharashtra seems to be deepening its bond with dynastic culture. 'Netas' of all hues show no qualms in gifting nominations to their kith and kin. The 'beta-beti' bandwagon is trundling across at least nine assembly constituencies in the city. ""The mooning-swooning Papa-Mummies and a team of fawning attendants turn elections into a Bharatiya soap opera,"" said theatre person Vishwas Sohoni. ""The entire exercise is to perpetuate family rule in the party and safeguard political citadels,"" said writer-critic Meena Waishampayan. Topping the list of scions is Yuva Sena chief Aditya Thackeray—the first resident of Matoshree to contest a poll and grandson of the late Balasaheb who, point out veteran Senaites, placed more emphasis on 'samajkaaran' (social awakening) than 'raajkaaran' (power politics). ""Balasaheb had supreme disdain for electoral politics… he would deride democracy and say it only fanned greed, betrayal and factionalism. It was in the 1990s when the Sena began to expand its base in the wake of the Hindutva resurgence that Balasaheb thought of grooming Uddhavji as his political heir. Yet, Uddhavji never thought of contesting an election,"" said Yashwant Parab, a Sena sympathiser. Today, not many in Sena would take a leaf out of Balasaheb's book, said party watchers. The number of Sena functionaries eager to promote GenNext is rising. Environment minister Ramdas Kadam's son Yogesh is Sena candidate in Khed. Saamna executive editor and Sena MP Sanjay Raut's brother Sunil is contesting from Bhandup for a second term. BMC standing committee chief Yashwant Jadhav's wife Yamini is the Sena candidate from Byculla. In Bandra (E), it is Zeeshan, son of ex-minister and Congress leader Baba Siddique, who is the party's candidate. Vidya Thakur, wife of BJP functionary Jayaprakash Thakur, is also vying to retain her Goregaon pocketborough. Vidya was minister of state for food and civil supplies in the Fadnavis regime. Sunil Rane, BJP candidate from Borivli, is the son of Datta Rane, a senior party leader and minister in the 1990s. BJP has also offered a ticket to Rahul Narwekar from Colaba. A party hopper, Narwekar left NCP to join Sena before recently defecting to BJP. He is son-in-law of Ramraje Naik-Nimbalkar, NCP leader and chairman of Maharashtra legislative council. Rahul's father was once a corporator from Colaba. 'Betis' too are flaunting the family card with glee. Varsha Gaikwad, former minister and Congress candidate from Dharavi, is daughter of ex-party MP and Mumbai Congress committee chief Eknath Gaikwad. Geeta Gawli, Akhil Bharatiya Sena corporator and daughter of Arun Gawli, is the party's candidate in Byculla. Aditi Tatkare is NCP candidate from Shriwardhan in Raigad district, from where her father Sunil is the party MP. In Muktai Nagar, Jalgaon, BJP pacified party veteran Eknath Khadse, who was keen on joining the poll fray, by offering the candidature to his daughter Rohini. The initiation of the third generation of Pawars ran into rough weather as Partha, Ajit Pawar's son, lost the Lok Sabha poll from Mawal in May this year. This time around, Pawar has cleared the nomination of Rohit, grandson of the NCP president's eldest brother, from Baramati, the family's bastion in Pune district. Amit Dheeraj Deshmukh are also contesting from two seats in Latur, in Marathwada, to safeguard their fiefdom. They are the late Vilasrao Deshmukh's sons. Actor Riteish Deshmukh lent a dash of glamour to their campaign by sweating it out on Latur’s streets, prompting a Congressman to remark, 'Bhai ho toh aisa.'

Nashik: District Election Office launches‘single window system’ for permissions | Nashik News - Times of India,"NASHIK: The District Election Office (DEO) has started a ‘single window system’ for political parties and individuals to get all the required permissions at one go. “We have started the single window system at all the offices of ‘returning officer’ (RO) of the respective assembly constituencies so that getting permissions for the campaigners gets easy,” a senior officer from the DEO said. The system is operational at all respective offices of the assembly segments so that the campaigners do not have to travel long distances for seeking the same. “During the Lok Sabha elections (Nashik and Dindori), the ROs had their offices at the district headquarters whereas for the assembly elections, the offices of the ROs have been stationed at the taluka headquarters. Hence, the permissions will also be given from the same office,” the officer added. The candidates or their representatives have to ensure they have all the required documents in place and submit the same through the ‘single window system’ for seeking permission from the concerned authorities in the stipulated time. A candidate requiring permission for organizing the cross-road meetings will have to seek the permission of the local civic body and the police department. In general cases, the candidates would have to run from pillar to post to get sanctions. “But now the single window will have all the officers stationed in one place for issuing the necessary certificates,” the officer said. Similarly, if a vehicle is to be used in public rally, its papers have to be mandated by the Regional Transport Officer. The single window system also has the provision of ensuring the RTO official is present at the spot to grant the required permission so that the permission seeker does not have to any other office. “The services are clubbed under single roof to ensure there is no wastage of time and also that the permission for the programmes are given at the earliest. This is in the interest of the individuals or small parties as the bigger parties have good long battery of the people working for the same,” the officer added.

"Maharashtra assembly polls: Sugar barons in Maharashtra switch party colours as clout, money and vote banks slip away | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: The sweet story of sugar riches proving fertile ground for political growth began souring with the collapse of the cooperative sector in Maharashtra. With the sugar industry in the red, the clout of Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders associated with sugar mills diminished and they are looking for rehabilitation. NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who built his 50-year political career around the sugar industry, can only watch as his trusted lieutenants in the sugar belt desert him. Bharatiya Janata Partyled governments at the state and the Centre have offered nothing by way of packages or bailouts to the flagging industry since coming to power in 2014. The sugarcanerich Kolhapur district is an example of how the political influence of sugar barons has waned. Eight of the 10 MLAs here are from Shiv Sena and BJP, but none have any association with the functioning of sugar mills. The remaining two MLAs from the NCP — Hasan Mushrif from Kagal and Sandhyadevi Kupekar from Chandgad — are directly connected with cooperative sugar factories. Experts attribute the industry’s decline to two key decisions. One, the lifting of the zoning system in 2006 meant that a sugar farmer was no longer obliged to sell his produce to a particular factory. This created competition among millers to give farmers the best price. Second, private players were allowed to set up factories. Sugar expert J P Medhe said the growth of private mills destroyed the cooperative factories. Cooperative mills grew from 96 in 2013-14 to 101 in 2017-18, but private mills grew from 61 to 87 over the same period. “People with experience in sugar production were opening their own factories. These factories did not have the social commitment of cooperative mills,” he said, adding that businessmen leasing out or taking over cooperative mills set a bad precedent. Industry experts cited the example of the Vasantdada Patil cooperative sugar factory in Sangli, once the biggest in the country, which has now been leased out to a private entrepreneur. The mill was founded by former chief minister, the late Vasantdada Patil. The political influence of Vasantdada’s family declined when the sugar mill started running into trouble. His grandson, Vishal Patil, contested as a candidate of the Swabhimani Paksha in this year’s Lok Sabha elections, but lost to BJP’s Sanjaykaka Patil. At the peak of the cooperative movement, Maharashtra had around 350 registered mills, half of which were the lifeline of the economy in the sugar belt of 13 districts in western Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha. The mills helped farmers get a good price and brought jobs and prosperity to the region. As a result, the directors of these cooperatives grew close to the political dispensation, gradually becoming their benefactors and eventually, political overlords. For example, Asia’s first cooperative sugar mill, Pravara Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana, has spawned three generations of politicians — Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, son Radhakrishna and grandson Sujay. With money and power throttled, former and present mill owners are switching sides from Congress and NCP to BJP. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Girl footballers set sights on netas in Maharashtra poll season, submit manifesto seeking better facilities, RTE | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Bandra girls Hiral Makhwani and Madhuri Kadam are regular at football practice at a playground in their vicinity. They are the envy of several other adolescent girls in their neighbourhood who want to join them but aren’t allowed to. “Apart from societal norms, parents are worried about the safety of the girls because there are no amenities in place at the playground. There is no toilet or changing room for us. We want the next government to change that,” said Makhwani. The two are part of a 15-girl club that trains with help from CRY partner NGO, Habitat and Livelihood Welfare Association. The group, along with more girls in the slums of Nargis Dutt Nagar and Rahul Nagar, has drafted a manifesto and is handing it to the political parties. “The adolescents in the area need basic amenities, education and support to be able to be successful. That’s why there is a need to put forth the demands of the youth,” said Shweta Damle, founder of the association. The manifesto has been submitted to Bharatiya Janata Party and meetings with other political parties are being lined up. “The Mumbai District Football Association’s field was available to use only at 6am but going there was impossible because of safety issues. Even for a sport like football we need so many equipment and accessories. The other sports are even more inaccessible,” said Kadam, a junior college student who aspires to represent the country in football. Apart from better access and opportunities in sports, the girls have demanded better implementation of the Right to Education Act, 2009, and freeships and scholarships for higher education. “Many of the girls drop out due to financial reasons and even if we finish class X, college education is expensive. Most of us are also not aware of the skill development courses or job opportunities available. The government needs to create awareness,” said Kajal Shedmake, a member of the group. Affordable travel, better health and sanitation facilities and access to open spaces too are on their mind. “Our living conditions are very poor and it makes it very difficult to find time from the daily chores to be able to pursue anything for oneself. If our basic necessities are taken care of through the public systems, parents will give girls an opportunity to continue education too,” said Mariam Sheikh, a student of Rizvi College in Bandra, who is a first generation learner in her family. “The list of essential items exempted from GST too needs to be expanded. Public libraries, night shelters and food and action against climate change too are on the girls’ manifesto. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Haryana, Maharashtra election: Voting in Maharashtra, Haryana assembly elections on Monday; bypolls to be held in 51 assembly seats | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI/CHANDIGARH: Polling will be held on Monday to elect Maharashtra and Haryana assemblies with the BJP and its allies seeking to retain power in the two states on the back of the recent Lok Sabha polls victory, while the opposition is hoping to turn the tide by taking advantage of any anti-incumbency. Bypolls will also be held to 51 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha constituencies spread across 18 states. In Maharashtra, where the 'Mahayuti' alliance of BJP, Shiv Sena and smaller parties is against the 'Maha-agadhi' led by the Congress and the NCP, a total of 8,98,39,600 people, including 4,28,43,635 women, are eligible to vote. ALSO READ: Maharashtra, Haryana Elections 2019 Live UpdatesAs many as 3,237 candidates, including 235 women, are contesting in 288 seats and 96,661 polling booths are in place with 6.5 lakh staff for the voting exercise. The ruling BJP is locked in a contest with the opposition Congress and the fledgling JJP for the 90 assembly seats in Haryana which has over 1.83 crore voters, including 85 lakh women and 252 transgenders, while 19,578 polling stations have been set up. Polling will be held from 7 am to 6 pm. Tight security arrangements have been made with deployment of more than three lakh personnel from state police and central forces in Maharashtra, while over 75,000 security personnel have been mobilised in Haryana. Counting of votes will be held on October 24. The high-voltage electioneering by the BJP saw participation of a galaxy of leaders led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his cabinet colleagues Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, as it continued to aggressively raise the nationalism plank by focusing on scrapping of Article 370 provisions on special status to Jammu and Kashmir and targeted the opposition on national security and corruption. The opposition tried to corner the BJP governments at the Centre and in the states on the handling of the economy with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi blaming the ruling party for the economic slowdown and unemployment and highlighting issues like ""failure"" of demonetisation and GST rollout. The BJP, which is seeking a second straight term under chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra, is contesting 162 seats, which include candidates of smaller allies contesting on its lotus symbol, while Sena has fielded candidates on 126 seats. On the other hand, the Congress has fielded 147 candidates and the ally NCP 121. Among other parties, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), led by Raj Thackeray, has fielded 101 candidates, the CPI 16, the CPM 8. The BSP has fielded candidates in 262 constituencies. A total of 1400 Independents are also in the poll arena. The opposition campaign was, however, lacklusture as both the Congress and the NCP were plagued by infighting and desertions in the run-up to the polls. The bypoll for Satara Lok Sabha constituency will also be held on October 21. Former NCP leader and sitting MP Udayanraje Bhosale is in the fray from the seat on a BJP ticket against Shriniwas Patil of the Congress-NCP combine. Voting will also be held in bypolls to Samastipur (Bihar) Lok Sabha seats which was held by Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance. The campaign in Maharashtra was marked by personal attacks and sharp exchange of barbs between chief minister Fadnavis and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who hit the hustings at the age of 79 and addressed a number of rallies. However, the Congress and NCP failed to hold even a single joint rally. While Modi addressed nine rallies across the state, Rahul Gandhi spoke at six public meetings. The campaign also saw an undertone of jostling for supremacy between the BJP and the Sena, which had fought the last assembly elections separately, winning 122 and 63 seats respectively. The Congress had bagged 42 and the NCP 41 seats. In the April-May Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-Sena alliance won 41 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, while the Congress won one and NCP four seats. Prominent candidates in the fray are chief minister Fadnavis and his predecessors from Congress, Ashok Chavan, who is in fray from Bhokar in Nanded district, and Prithviraj Chavan seeking re-election from Karad South in Satara district. Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray, son of Uddhav Thackeray, is contesting from Worli in Mumbai. The 29-year-old is the first from the Thackeray family to make debut in electoral politics. In Haryana, the Congress is hoping to make a comeback following a change in guard in the state, while the BJP led by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has set a target of winning 75 seats out of 90 in which 1,169 candidates of various political outfits are contesting. Currently, the BJP has 48 members in state assembly. The Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), a breakaway faction of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), is also hoping for an improvement in its prospects following the Lok Sabha debacle. The party had emerged on the scene following a feud in the Chautala clan in December last year. The BSP, AAP, INLD-SAD combine, Swaraj India and the Loktantra Suraksha Party (LSP) have thrown their hat into the ring, though none of them is fighting on all 90 seats. Prominent among those in the contest are chief minister Khattar (Karnal), former chief minister and Congress Legislative Party leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda (Garhi Sampla-Kiloi), Randeep Singh Surjewala (Kaithal), Kiran Choudhary (Tosham) and Kuldeep Bishnoi (Adampur) and JJP's Dushyant Chautala (Uchana Kalan). The BJP has fielded three sportspersons — Babita Phogat (Dadri), Yogeshwar Dutt (Baroda in Sonipat) and Sandeep Singh (Pehowa) — besides TikTok star Sonali Phogat (Adampur). While Prime Minister Modi addressed seven rallies in the state, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi addressed two election meetings. In the 2014 assembly polls, the BJP for the first time came to power in Haryana winning 47 seats. It won the Jind bypolls earlier this year, taking its total strength in the state assembly to 48. The INLD had 19 MLAs while the Congress has 17 legislators. The BSP and the SAD had bagged one seat each in the last polls while five were Independents. Voting will also be held in bypolls to 51 assembly seats spread across 17 states. The BJP and its allies had nearly 30 of these assembly seats, while the Congress had won 12 and the rest were with regional parties. Among the states ruled by the BJP and its allies, the maximum 11 seats will have bypolls in Uttar Pradesh, followed by six in Gujarat, five in Bihar, four in Assam and two each in Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The other states where bypolls will be held are Punjab (4 seats), Kerala (5 seats), Sikkim (3 seats), Rajasthan (two seats) and one seat each in Arunachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Puducherry, Meghalaya and Telangana. The exercise is coinciding with assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra, the first major elections after the BJP retained power in the Lok Sabha polls in April-May winning 303 seats out of 543. In politically crucial Uttar Pradesh, the polls are seen as a litmus test for the Yogi Adityanath government which has completed 30 months in office. It is a four-cornered contest with the BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress fielding candidates on all 11 assembly seats. Eight of these seats were held earlier by the BJP and one by BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal). The seats of Rampur and Jalalpur (Ambedkarnagar) were held by the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, respectively The Congress is hoping to consolidate its thin majority in Rajasthan by wresting the two seats from the BJP and its ally RLP. Of the 200 assembly seats in Rajasthan, the Congress has 106 MLAs, including the six who defected to the party from the BSP recently The AIADMK and DMK are locked in a keen contest in Vikravandi and Nanguneri Assembly seats in Tami Nadu.

BJP gets smaller share of fauji votes than in 2014 Maharashtra assembly polls | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: It is widely believed that the BJP gets a much larger share of postal votes—the overwhelming majority of which are from people serving in the armed forces and paramilitary—than its share of the overall vote. So prevalent is this view that even psephologists and political pundits on TV warn us not to take the early trends in results as indicative because those are based on counting of postal votes. Data from the Maharashtra elections, however, show that at least in this state the assumption is wrong. Both in the 2014 and 2019 assembly polls, the NCP was the only party among the four big four in the state that got a significantly higher share of postal (read fauji) votes than it did of the overall votes ( see graphic). In 2014, the NCP got 22.1% of the 2.1 lakh-odd postal votes in the state assembly elections, while its overall voteshare was much lower at 17.2%. Similarly, in the 2019 assembly polls, it got 20.2% of the nearly 2.8 lakh postal votes cast in the state. Again, its overall voteshare of 16.7% was significantly lower. The Sena also, in these elections, got a higher share of postal votes (17.1%) than its overall voteshare of 16.4%. This was unlike in 2014, where it got 18.5% of postal votes and 19.4% of the overall votes. BJP and Congress got exactly as much of the postal votes this time as they did of the overall votes. In the BJP’s case, the share was 25.8% in both cases and for the Congress was 15.9%. Clearly, faujis from Maharashtra were neither more nor less likely to support these two national parties than civilian voters. In an election in which the BJP campaigned extensively on nationalism and its ‘bold’ approach to national security, this is a particularly surprising finding. In 2014, the BJP’s share of postal votes was slightly higher than its share of overall votes, but by just 0.5 percentage points. The Congress in those elections too had got the same share of postal votes as it did of votes cast in EVMs. The combined BJP-Sena share of postal votes in 2019, at 42.9% was sharply down from 46.8% in 2014, just as its overall vote share went down from 47.2% to 42.2%. What explains the slightly higher share for NCP in postal votes? It may well have to do with the regions in which postal votes are concentrated. In the 60 seats of the Mumbai region, for instance, there were less than 15,000 postal votes spread over 60 seats, an average of less than 250 votes per seat. In contrast, western Maharashtra had an average of over 1,200 postal votes per seat. The NCP’s strength in this region would have helped it secure more fauji votes. Another possible reason could be that certain communities tend to be more represented in the armed forces than others for historical reasons and parties that have a social base among those communities would therefore tend to have a larger share of postal votes. Either way, what it suggests is that just like other parts of the population, voting preferences of those serving in the armed forces are determined by a host of local factors and not just grand national narratives.

"Maharashtra assembly polls: CMship a sticking point, but not on table now, says BJP | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: On a day Union home minister and BJP chief Amit Shah called up Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray to congratulate him on the BJP-Sena’s victory in the state assembly polls and said they would discuss power-sharing after Diwali, BJP sources said the question of chief ministership was not on the table despite Uddhav’s insistence on the “50:50” formula, which means equal distribution of portfolios and sharing of the CM’s post for 2.5 years each. Sources close to CM Devendra Fadnavis said the BJP would not accept the Sena’s demand for sharing of the top post as it had won 105 seats and “secured the support of 10 independents”, and if the Sena asked for the post for the first 2.5 years of the new government, the BJP would rather not enter into a deal with the Sena at all. The Sena, however, took a jibe at the BJP with its mouthpiece Saamna saying “power and largescale defections cannot crush the opposition” and the paper’s executive editor Sanjay Raut posted on Twitter a cartoon of a smiling tiger, with a clock (NCP symbol) adorning its neckline and a lotus in its hand. Raut’s comment with it was “Bura naa maano Diwali hai.” Newly elected Sena legislators, who visited the Thackeray residence Matoshree on Friday, insisted that Aaditya Thackeray, who won his debut poll from Worli on Thursday, should become the CM. Sena’s Prakash Surve, who retained his Magathane seat, told TOI, “We demanded Aadityaji should lead the state cabinet.” Reports in a section of the media on the likelihood of Congress and NCP extending support to Sena to form the government too created a flutter in the state’s political circles on Friday afternoon before they were dismissed by state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat, who said his party and NCP had no such plans. BJP sources said CM Fadnavis, who led the party’s campaign in Maharashtra, had taken the view that the party had won more than 100 seats for the second consecutive time, so there was no question of giving in to the Sena’s demands. Sources said at the most, the question of distribution of ministerial berths could be discussed and settled. “The Sena may demand portfolios held by the BJP between 1995 and 1999, when Sena and BJP were in power. The BJP then held the home, irrigation, finance, public works and energy departments. Except for the home department, the CM might be willing to looking into it,” the sources noted. However, a BJP functionary questioned the validity of the 1995 power-sharing formula. “In 1995, the Sena-BJP alliance government had the post of deputy CM, and that leader had the home portfolio. This was when Sena had 73 seats and BJP 65, so the difference in numbers was very small. Now the BJP has 105 seats and the Sena 56, almost 50 less than BJP. How can the Sena then expect the same old formula?” Pramod Olekar, a political analyst, said the Sena may be employing pressure tactics in order to get plum portfolios. “The Sena will get a few key portfolios no doubt,” he said. He added that the Sena may be willing to accept the deputy CM’s post and some key portfolios. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra elections 2019: BJP-Shiv Sena will be back with three-fourths majority, says Amit Shah | Kolhapur News - Times of India","KOLHAPUR/NEW DELHI: Udayan Raje Bhosale, the 13th direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, joined BJP on Saturday in New Delhi in the presence of BJP president Amit Shah and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for his second stint with the party, with Shah asserting that the BJP-led saffron alliance would come back to power in Maharashtra with a three-fourths majority in the October assembly elections. Bhosale was a BJP minister in Maharashtra in 1998, when the Sena-BJP alliance was in power, but lost to the NCP in the 1999 assembly elections. He later joined the NCP and was elected to the Lok Sabha thrice, the third time during this year's general elections in May. Welcoming Bhosale into the BJP, Shah said the Fadnavis government has worked for the state's all-round development and ""restored"" its pride in its five-year rule. Shah said the BJP and its alliance would receive even bigger support in the assembly polls after it had decimated the Congress-NCP alliance in the Lok Sabha polls in May this year. Prior to joining the BJP on Saturday, Bhosale resigned from the Lok Sabha to which he was elected from Satara. A by-election will have to be held for the Satara Lok Sabha constituency. Bhosale has been insisting that the by-election be held along with the assembly elections in October. However, the Shiv Sena may pose a hurdle before the BJP as the seat is with them. Bhosale joined the BJP in New Delhi at an event organised at the residence of Union home minister Amit Shah, who is also BJP national president. Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and state BJP president Chandrakant Patil were the other senior leaders present at the function. ""I was not feeling comfortable in the NCP. I was highly impressed because of the Modi government's decision on Jammu and Kashmir,"" Udayan Raje told the media after the event. He was referring to the nullification on August 5 of Article 370 which had granted special status to Jammu & Kashmir. Patil said that Bhosale's entry would strengthen the BJP in Maharashtra. ""Bhosale was always mentally with the BJP even though he was in the NCP,"" Patil noted. BJP working president J.P. Nadda and general secretary Bhupender Yadav, who is his party's in-charge for the state polls, were also present on the occasion. Bhosale updated all the developments of the day through his social media accounts, including his departure for the national capital along with CM Fadnavis. Bhosale has appealed to all residents of Satara to welcome Fadnavis's 'Maha Janadesh yatra' on Sunday. Udayan Raje is expected to accompany Fadnavis on his yatra in Satara district. Speaking at an event in Ahmednagar later on Saturday evening, Fadnavis said that all the descendants of Shivaji Maharaj are now with their party. Udayan Raje and his cousin Shivendra Raje Bhosale, who are political rivals, are now with the BJP. Shivendra Raje too switched from the NCP to BJP recently. Reacting to the development, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged that Udayan Raje had joined the BJP in order to sell off the inherited ""historical"" lands of Shivaji Maharaj. Meanwhile, former Satara district Congress president Anandrao Patil held a meeting of his supporters in Karad on Friday. He is expected to join the BJP in Karad during the CM's yatra. Satyajit Deshmukh, son of senior Congress leader, the late Shivajirao Deshmukh, has also called a meeting of his supporters in Sangli on Sunday.

Maharashtra elections: Rules for permission keep campaigns on a short run | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Campaigning that has been low key throughout its length ends in a few days. Citizens' tweets and comments on social media indicate public outreach has been minimal with mohalla rallies and sabhas missing. Party candidates and independents told TOI that permissions for campaigning and rallies in the city this time were difficult to get. Permissions are sought 48 hours prior to campaigning which negates any spontaneous rallies. Congress general secretary, spokesperson and campaign committee member Ramesh Iyer told TOI that time was short, physical contact had reduced as had the number of people participating in a campaign. “Traditional campaigns used to dominate an election season but now, candidates tend to contact people through social media. Public meetings happened on the roadside. But the restrictions imposed by the Election Commission mean only some part can be used for such meetings,” he added. Congress candidate Datta Bahirat from Shivajinagar constituency said, “One has to apply for permissions 48 hours before the campaign and it is granted within 36 hours of receipt of the application. Many party workers plan spontaneously and call the candidate for campaigning but the application and getting permission is a long process and such initiatives fizzle out.” Independent candidate Sanjay Turekar from Shivajinagar seat said paperwork is involved in getting permissions for campaigning which also have to be sought 48 hours prior to a campaign. “There is a drop in the number of supporters. They join only if paid.” Independent candidate Firoz Mulla said independents do not have the manpower to campaign like candidates from bigger parties. “ Those who campaign want to be paid and independents do not have that kind of money,” he said. An election official said after obtaining the necessary clearance from other departments, they issue permission for the campaign within 36 hours of the receipt of the application. “Many candidates have objected to this rule of 48 hours as they fix events at the last moment. Many party workers are not available when permissions finally arrive. We work according to directions of the Election Commission of India,” the official said. Such guidelines preclude the possibility of a tense situation involving political parties being present at the same spot for their respective campaigns.

Maharashtra News: Shiv Sena-NCP-Cong may give affidavits of 154 MLAs to Supreme Court to prove majority | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The newly-minted Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance is planning to submit affidavits of 154 MLAs — the majority mark is 145 — to the Supreme Court today to argue that it has a majority in the Maharashtra assembly and the BJP-Ajit Pawar combine has no right to be in office. A former chief minister confirmed to TOI that 56 MLAs from Shiv Sena, 44 from Congress, 46 from NCP, and eight independents have signed identical affidavits against the installation of Devendra Fadnavis as CM. “Fadnavis was installed secretly despite the fact that he had no majority,” he said. The alliance’s strategists feel the affidavits will bolster its case for an immediate floor test. The task of keeping three sets of MLAs under watch is likely to get more challenging with each passing day and this is a cause for concern. “We will be submitting relevant documents in court on Monday,” Congress leader and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said when asked about the development. The political battle has reached a crucial phase as Ajit Pawar on Sunday claimed to represent the NCP and indicated he was ready for a show of strength, while promising a “stable government”. BJP sources said the party is confident that NCP legislators are not as committed to its chief Sharad Pawar as may seem to be the case. ‘SC-monitored floor test is required’The Aghadi will urge the Supreme Court that guidelines prescribed by it in Karnataka and Uttarkhand should be followed in letter and spirit. In Karnataka, the Supreme Court had prescribed a specific time-frame for voting on the confidence motion, while in the Uttarakhand case, it had pointed out that the entire exercise should be conducted under the supervision of the chief secretary and DGP. “For Maharashtra, our plea is that it should be conducted directly under the supervision of apex court,’’ Prithviraj Chavan said.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Online voting, more poll days among better turnout ideas | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: Voting is voluntary, but a simpler and convenient process that encompasses most electors, and more efforts by the election authorities and political parties to connect with voters will improve the turnout. The average turnout for the state assembly polls, in five decades, is 62.22%. ECI officials hope to make it 70% this time. They have geotagged over 7,000 polling stations and are distributing voter slips to boost the turnout. Former retired bureaucrat V Ramani said the entire election process must be simple. Distance of polling stations is an issue and laws should be amended to allow online voting. ""When banking transactions are safe using Aadhaar why not voting?' he said. Political parties should go to each voter so that no one is left out in the election process. More election days would help citizens make an informed choice, he added. Environment activist Ravindra Sinha said apathy towards voting may just continue as a large section is not motivated to vote. ""They feel politicians have failed to connect with ground issues and are disillusioned when water, roads, garbage disposal and electricity needs are unfulfilled."" he said. A first-time voter from Kasba Peth assembly constituency who get barcoded slips is not sure about the candidates as there is no voter reach out programme. ""Time is less but the atmosphere about an upcoming election in the state,'' she said. Election officials are hopeful the turnout will be good. ""Geotagging, ensuring that the voters receive voter slips, help desks and the helpline number 1950 should work,'' district collector Naval Kishore Ram said.

Maharashtra election panel set to finalise ward formation report | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: A team of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC)’s  department is in Mumbai as the State Election Commission is in the process of finalising the ward formation report. The development is crucial to the AMC general elections scheduled for April. Overturning its previous circular, the state election commission, on January 3, had told the AMC that the general election of the civic body will be held in single ward pattern. Subsequently, a new ward formation plan was prepared. In the last AMC general election, there were total 113 wards. After Satara and Deolai wards were added in 2016, the number went up to 115. However, the AMC election department had to redefine the boundaries of all wards to meet the election commission’s guideline and divide each ward based on population of 10,000. This was chiefly to adjust the Satara-Deolai wards which alone had population of 52,000. The ward formation plan prepared by the municipal corporation’s election department was presented to the three-member committee comprising divisional commissioner, district collector and municipal commissioner in the first week of January. The committee approved the plan and the same was sent to the state election commission. The EC had asked the civic body’s election department to make certain changes in the plan and resend it. At present, deputy municipal commissioner Kamlakar Phad is in Mumbai along with a team of officials from the municipal corporation’s election department.

Maharashtra elections: Five hamlets given solar lamps dream of electricity | Pune News - Times of India,"Effectively, Jorkar Met, Langhe Met, Pandher Met, and two Dhangar Met — hamlets on the Sinhagad fort — live in darkness in the monsoon months. They have no electricity and the solar panels installed in the huts work only for a few minutes because of the cloud cover. Each Met has five to seven houses. A maze of kaccha roads, easily a 45-minute walk, is the only way from Sinhagad fort or from Panshet road. Suresh Maruti Jorkar, 57, said he has never seen electricity in the village. “Last Diwali, the state government gave us solar panels and lamps. But during the rainy season, these lamps work for an hour or so. We need proper power supply,” he said. Jorkar has farmland and a small house in Jorkar Met. “I make a living selling milk to eateries located near the fort. I have six buffaloes. We used to work in the light of a kerosene lamp, but the government is not selling kerosene now,” he said. Local residents said earlier, each Met had 25 to 30 houses. “Over the years, many people migrated. Now, we have just five to seven houses,” he said. On why he stayed back in the hills, Jorkar said: “It requires a lot of money to move. I don’t have money. This is my property and I won’t leave it.” There are no schools in these hamlets. “We send our children to the nearby villages of Khanapur, Atkarwadi and Donje. They stay with our relatives and attend school,” Nandu Jorkar said. He studied up to Class V and then gave up because of the distance. He too is into dairy farming. “The government authorities, in a meeting some time ago, informed villagers that it is costly to supply electricity to the villages and the houses are few. They said the cost would run up to Rs 27 lakh, which is not feasible,” Nandu added. But the hamlets desperately want power supply. “We can look after our livestock, keep big cats at bay and enjoy a bit of television,” both Jorkars said. Amol Padher, a member of Ghera Sinhagad group gram panchayat, said they had provided 27 solar lamps and panels to 27 homes last year after learning that government officials were reluctant to supply power. “We have been making rounds of government offices seeking power supply. Last year, we succeeded in getting supply to the fort and we now have street lamps on the fort,” he added. This election, they hope they will get electricity.

Maharashtra assembly polls: Palghar recorded biggest drop of 21% in voter turnout across Maharashtra | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Palghar constituency in Thane has recorded the highest decline in voter turnout in the state—a sheer drop of 20.9% between the assembly polls of 2014 and 2019. The tribal constituency had recorded a 68% turnout in 2014, which fell to 47% in this election. This constituency has reported the largest change in voter turnout since 2014. Palghar saw drama before the election with the sitting MLA Amit Ghoda who was- with the Shiv Sena joining hands with the NCP after the Sena denied him a ticket. The Sena fielded Srinivas Wanga, son of the late BJP MLA Chintaman Wanga. Ghoda even filed his nomination as a rebel but was persuaded to withdraw by the Sena. Ghoda’s supporters, though, reportedly did not cooperate with Wanga in the campaign. The Panvel constituency in Navi Mumbai saw an almost 13% drop in voter turnout. Here, BJP’s sitting MLA Prashant Ramsheth Thakur contested against Peasant and Worker Party’s Harsh Keni who was supported by the Congress and NCP. A sizeable number of colonies in Panvel, though, had threatened to boycott the poll over lack of development in the area which may have hit the turnout. The Sakri constituency in rural Dhule in North Maharashtra as well as Jalgaon Urban saw a 10.5% fall in voter turnout from 2014. Pune’s Kasba Peth also experienced a 10% drop in turnout since 2014. It fell from 61.5% in 2014 to 51.5% in 2019. Kasba Peth is a BJP stronghold and was earlier represented by senior leader Girish Bapat who is now an MP. This year, the BJP fielded mayor Mukta Tilak against Congress’ Arvind Shinde. The highest rise in voter turnout was seen in the Jalgaon Jamod constituency in Vidarbha’s Buldhana district. It rose 10.3% since 2014. BJP minister Sanjay Kute won the last election from here, narrowly defeating Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh candidate. Ulhasnagar witnessed an 8.7% rise in turnout.

Winner of Khadakwasla seat ‘announced’ before counting | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The counting of votes is on Thursday but supporters of Nationalist Congress Party's Khadakwasla candidate Sachin Dodke are so confident of his victory that they have put up a huge flex board congratulating him on becoming an MLA. The hoarding was put up in Warje on Monday night soon after polling ended. He was pitted against BJP's sitting MLA Bhimrao Tapkir. The flex is the topic of discussion among local political workers. Sources from the local NCP unit say this is not the first time such a flex has been put up. Dodke’s supporters had put up such flexes before the results of the 2017 Pune Municipal Corporation election were announced with the belief that displaying such a banner leads to an actual victory. “We are just waiting for the results. Everyone here is confident about Dodke’s win. Victory is assured when flex boards are put up. There will be a huge rally on Thursday,” one of Dodke’s supporters said. They also held a rally on Monday night after putting up the flex board. They congratulated citizens especially from Warje and the adjoining area where Dodke has a strong support for their support. The NCP has been aspiring for a win in Khadakwasla constituency. The fight this time is expected to be close as NCP has claimed that it was able to overcome factionalism within the party to put up a united fight against the BJP. Tapkir is hoping for a third consecutive term from Khadakwasla. He has a strong presence in Dhankawdi and the rural parts. When contacted, Dodke said he was aware of the flex and was confident of his victory. “This time, we received huge support. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena too extended support to my candidature.

Congress-NCP worried about fortunes going further south in North Maharashtra | Nashik News - Times of India,"NASHIK: The BJP is looking to cash in on the inroads it has made in North Maharashtra over five years. Contests involving two prominent leaders, guardian minister Girish Mahajan and former deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal, are among the most highprofile in the region. Mahajan, seen as CM Devendra Fadnavis’s confidant, has been entrusted with ensuring a big win for the party in the four districts of Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar and Jalgaon. Mahajan, who hails from Jalgaon, also has to keep disgruntled BJP leader Eknath Khadse in check. Ever since Bhujbal has been put behind bars in an alleged money laundering case, the NCP strongman has been subdued. His nephew Sameer lost the recent Lok Sabha elections. He could not secure a lead over Shiv Sena’s Hemant Godse even in the two assembly seats represented by Bhujbal and his son Pankaj. The BJP-led alliance won 21 of 35 assembly seats in North Maharashtra in the 2014 polls. With BJP-Sena having retained all five LS seats in the region this year, they are hoping to improve on their tally in the state polls. In the LS polls, apart from Yeola and Nandgaon represented by the Bhujbals, Congress-held Igatpuri and Shirpur had also voted in favour of the BJP. The biggest jolt for Congress was the exit of veteran leader Manikrao Gavit’s family in Nandurbar. The nine-time MP was miffed after his son Bharat was denied nomination for the LS polls. Now Bharat and his wife, Sangeeta, both zilla parishad members, have joined the BJP. Manikrao’s daughter Nirmala Gavit, who has the Igatpuri assembly seat, has joined Sena. Both have been given tickets. “Voters are in no mood to side with forces opposed to PM Modi. The state government is working to improve public services. We were fed up of infighting within the Congress at the local level, of which the high command did not take note,” Bharat told TOI. An NCP leader admitted it is a “tough time” for the coalition. “We will have to chalk out a strategy to prevent a split of secular votes,” he added. The rank and file of Congress and NCP are disillusioned due to the exodus to the NDA camp. Many feel the conviction of ex-minister and NCP man Gulabrao Deokar in the housing scam has sent wrong signals to voters. Tthough two Sena netas, Sureshdada Jain and sitting MLA Chandrakant Sonawane have also been convicted in the scam, no one from the BJP, a dominant force in the region, have been named.

Though the BJP and Shiv Sena contested the elections jointly, the Amit Shah-led party's refusal to share the chief minister's post became the bone of contention between the saffron parties, resulting in a stalemate over government formation after the poll results were declared on October 24. If the Sena decides to form government with the support of the opposition parties, the collective strength of the three parties in the House will go up to 154, above the halfway mark of 145. While the Congress is holding up its cards, the NCP made it clear on Sunday that the Shiv Sena would have to break away from the NDA before the Sharad Pawar-led party can think of lending support to Uddhav Thackeray's party.

"Maharashtra Election: BJP says it can’t form Maharashtra govt, guv asks Shiv Sena if it can | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: In a swift response to the Maharashtra governor’s request to express his “willingness and ability” to form the government, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis informed him on Sunday that the BJP—the single largest party in the new assembly with 105 MLAs—did not have the numbers to prove a majority, putting the ball back in the Shiv Sena’s court. Hours later, governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari called upon the Sena—the second largest bloc with 56 winning candidates—to apprise him if it was in a position to form a government. “The Sena will have to inform the governor about its stand by 7.30pm on Monday (November 11),” a Raj Bhavan official said. The two developments, back-to-back, now put the onus on Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to cobble together the numbers needed to reach the half-way mark in the assembly. The options before him are narrow. Congress and NCP with 44 and 54 MLAs have said they do not have the mandate and are ready to sit in the opposition. And Thackeray’s insistence on a Sena CM is a pre-condition that has so far prevented negotiations with BJP from making headway. But the NCP has conditionally agreed to back Sena, provided it withdraws its ministers from the NDA government at the Centre and agrees to a “common” programme for the state. A section of Congress MLAs, too, are keen to back a Sena-NCP front, though this is yet to find acceptance from the top leadership. Addressing a press meet after meeting the governor, BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said the mandate in the poll was for the ‘Mahayuti’ (the pre-poll alliance of BJP and Sena). “However, the Sena has not agreed to government formation. It is the Sena that has insulted the people’s mandate. We have decided not to form the government,” he said.

The Shiv Sena, which is determined to form a government without its long-term ally BJP, on Monday said it is waiting for an official communication of support from both the Congress and NCP. The BJP, which is the single largest party in the state, on Sunday   decided against staking claim   to form government for want of adequate numbers. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari  then invited the Shiv Sena   , which has been at loggerheads with the BJP over sharing the chief minister's post. The Sena is the second largest party in the 288-member House with only 56 MLAs after the BJP (105). Given the stalemate between the two alliance partners, the role of the Congress and the NCP is crucial. The NCP, which won 54 seats, 10 more than Congress in the state elections, said it had a pre-poll alliance with the grand old party, hence the decision on formation of a ""non- BJP"" government will be taken only after an official communication from the Sonia Gandhi-led party. Senior Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik said, ""All the Sena legislators have signed our party's proposal to stake claim to form government. We are, however, waiting for an official communication from the NCP and Congress on extending support to us.""

Govt revokes Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, bifurcates state into two Union TerritoriesThe BJP leadership feels the Article 370 pitch will go down well with urban voters who can tilt the scales in favour of the party in 132 of the total 288 assembly constituencies. “The rural heartland is abuzz with issues such as irrigation, water scarcity and support prices for foodgrains,” said a party strategist. This explains why Union home minister Amit Shah, at a BJP conclave in the city, went hammer and tongs against Jawaharlal Nehru for   turning J&amp;K into a “disputed territory”   . Recalling the role played by the party’s icons, Shah said Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee was clamped into prison by Sheikh Abdullah’s regime, where the former died. Shah stated that for the BJP, nullifying of Article 370 was about integrating Kashmir with India. “It’s about patriotism,” he added. But the opposition is peeved with BJP for giving precedence to patriotism over price rise, ‘deshbhakti’ over drought. NCP MP Supriya Sule said, “Why should BJP drag Article 370 into the state elections? This is like Fadnavis copying from Modi and Shah’s notebook. The BJP perhaps thinks Fadnavis’s regime hasn’t done much at the ground level, in terms of tackling agrarian issues, keeping prices of essential commodities under control and ensuring Mumbai is free of potholes.” Pointing out that BJP had every right, with an unprecedented mandate, to defang Article 370, Sule said, “But the Centre’s high-handed manner has been a matter of concern. The situation in J&K is grave. We have lost contact with our friends. People have been gagged. Tourism is in a shambles. Shah should also talk about this.” Stating that Kashmir was an integral part of India, Aslam Shaikh, Congress MLA from Malvani, said there was nothing wrong in Shah holding forth on Article 370. “But development and economic issues should set the poll agenda of every party,” he added. The urban chaos sparked by metro projects and the Aarey row may have prompted BJP to lay emphasis on Article 370, said a bureaucrat. “Projects are adding to pedestrians’ and motorists’ woes. The ‘development’ agenda is caught in a bind. The patriotism card can help blunt the edge of anti-government sentiment,” he said. Some civil society members are worried too. “Playing the patriotism card to impress voters is fraught with risk and could trigger jingoism,” said Manisha Tikekar, former head of the political science department at SIES college. “We have failed to deepen the content of our democracy,” she added.

"PMC depositors push NOTA tab, boycott Maharashtra assembly polls | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Many depositors of PMC Bank expressed their anger by either boycotting Monday’s elections or exercising their franchise but opting for NOTA (None of the Above) at polling booths. A section of medical students, and aspirants along with parents, also chose NOTA to protest the introduction of the Maratha quota this year. In Mulund colony, 70-yearold Lalchand Nanwani was fuming as he decided not to leave his residence along with his senior citizen wife to vote. “These politicians did not bother to visit our homes and enquire about our wellbeing. The Rs 40,000 withdrawal was pittance as we have huge medical costs,” he said. The colony has nearly 20,000 depositors. Scores of Sindhis and Sikh residents here were angry with the “government apathy” in the aftermath of the bank’s closure. A few went to the booths and voted NOTA, said Raju R Tejwani from the colony. Roads in the area which would be lively during past elections with citizens making a beeline for their booths were deserted on Monday. Attendance at nearby booths was below normal in the morning and early afternoon hours. “When there is any auto or bus fare hike, there is dharna by political parties on the roads. What about our bank crisis? Why didn’t any party come forward with a dharna here?” asked a peeved Jayant Khatri. “We should be compensated from the PM or CM relief fund. Our families are in deep crisis,” added Chandru Bulchandani. Among those who abstained from voting were families who lost relatives in the aftermath of the crisis and felt hopeless. The family of Andheri resident Sanjay Gulati, who died of heart attack, stayed away. Gulati’s widow Bindu said: “Not a single PMC, RBI or government officer has approached us since I lost my husband. I have to manage my autistic child’s school fees, household expenses, I have elderly in-laws to care for. With all my money held up in PMC Bank, what hope do I have left? Why should I vote amid my grief and my troubles?” In Mulund Colony, Prem Dharra, who lost his father Murlidhar, was undecided about voting. “No authority has approached us to ask after our welfare either,” he said. Oshiwara resident Shachi Pestonji said: “There seems to be a general consensus to not vote or go for NOTA, since most depositors are disappointed with the government response to the PMC problem.” However, several others thought otherwise. Arati Salgaonkar, who is a member of six PMC WhatsApp groups, said there had been a sentiment for NOTA at first. “However, individually we felt it is best to choose a candidate who has done work,” she said. PMC Bank staffers whose salary accounts are in the bank did go out to vote. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" If I worry about route, destiny wouldn't like it: Sanjay Raut | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Against the backdrop of Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari inviting the Shiv Sena to form government, party leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said if he shows concern towards the route, the destiny would not like it. The remark comes a day after the BJP announced it would not form government in Maharashtra and accused the Shiv Sena of ""disrespecting"" people's mandate secured by the NDA in recent assembly polls. Amid the bitter tussle with the BJP over the chief minister's post, the Shiv Sena has been making efforts to reach out to the NCP and Congress. ""Raaste ki parwah karunga to manzil bura maan jaayegi...."", Raut said in a tweet in Hindi. रास्ते की परवाह करूँगा तो मंजिल बुरा मान जाएगी………!— Sanjay Raut (@rautsanjay61) 1573437891000The Rajya Sabha member has of late been taking potshots at the BJP and acting chief minister Devendra Fadnavis through his tweets. The Shiv Sena, which is the second largest party in the 288-member House after the BJP, has time till 7.30 pm on Monday to stake claim to form government in the state. In the October 21 state polls, the BJP won 105 seats while the Shiv Sena bagged 56 seats. Besides, the NCP got 54 seats and the Congress 44. Though the BJP and Shiv Sena contested the elections jointly, the Amit Shah-led party's refusal to share the chief minister's post became the bone of contention between the saffron parties, resulting in a stalemate over government formation after the poll results were declared on October 24. If the Sena decides to form government with the support of the opposition parties, the collective strength of the three parties in the House will go up to 154, above the halfway mark of 145. While the Congress is holding up its cards, the NCP made it clear on Sunday that the Shiv Sena would have to break away from the NDA before the Sharad Pawar-led party can think of lending support to Uddhav Thackeray's party. However, Raut has been unfazed and reiterating that his party would have its chief minister in the state at any cost. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"After Marathas, BJP hopes to woo Dhangars | Kolhapur News - Times of India","KOLHAPUR: Caste dynamics and aspirations of different communities in Maharashtra kept the BJP on tenterhooks over the past five years. But the party can breathe a lot easier now after winning over the dominant Marathas by fulfilling their decades-old demand for reservations. The Marathas were the backbone of the NCP and Congress, but the victory of saffron alliance candidates in the community’s strongholds points to a shift in allegiance. In this year’s Lok Sabha elections, BJP-Sena won 42 of the 48 seats at stake, the same number as in 2014. Observers have attributed this to the support of the Maratha community following the reservations. The state government has granted 16% reservation to Marathas in jobs and education. This has given BJP the opportunity to expand beyond its social engineering experiment that helped the party shed its Brahminical image. Under the social engineering experiment, popularly known as MADHAV, the BJP brought leaders from the Mali (Ma), Dhangar (Dha) and Vanjari (V) communities into Maharashtra’s political landscape. It was the brainchild of late BJP veteran Vasantrao Bhagwat, who groomed leaders like the late N S Pharande of the Mali community, Annasaheb Dange of the Dhangar community and the late Gopinath Munde from the Vanjari community. BJP credits this experiment for its growth in the 1990s. However, the Dhangar community remains miffed with the state government for not taking a stand on its demand for reservations. The BJP has recently inducted into its fold Gopichand Padalkar, a leader of the community, and fielded him against Ajit Pawar in Baramati. Padalkar had contested the LS polls on a Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) ticket and had criticized the BJP government for delaying reservations for Dhangars. Now, he told TOI he has joined the BJP as he felt it was the only party serious about the quota demand. The BJP had committed to reservations for the Dhangars if elected to power in 2014, a promise it has failed to keep. Spread over Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Pune districts and parts of the Marathwada region, the Dhangar community comprises 9% of the state’s population and plays a decisive role in 30-35 assembly seats in western Maharashtra alone. Till it takes a call on reservations, the government has rolled out a Rs 1,000-crore package for Dhangars. They will benefit from 22 state schemes. So far, Congress and NCP have not raised the Maratha quota issue for the polls, fearing it may boomerang. On the other hand, the BJP is upbeat. BJP workers put up hoardings on NH-4 passing through Kolhapur, describing Fadnavis as the “architect of Maratha reservation” when his Mahajanadesh yatra reached western Maharashtra.

Even the elite area of Malabar Hill, notorious for its low voter turnout, had witnessed a rise in voting while Gujarati-dominated areas such as Borivli saw a major surge.

Maharashtra: Congress shepherds its flock to Jaipur for 'sightseeing' | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI/JAIPUR: Congress winners of the Maharashtra assembly election were shifted to Jaipur for ""sightseeing"" on Friday over fears of poaching by the BJP, which is short of numbers since its pre-poll ally Shiv Sena refuses to support it over a chief ministership tussle. Maharashtra Congress politician Vijay Wadettiwar said some MLA-elects were moved to Jaipur after specific information that some of them had been offered large amounts to support the BJP. ""We have told our legislators to record phone conversations and informed the Congress state unit chief. All our legislators are loyal and will not shift their loyalties to the BJP,"" Wadettiwar said.  Congress politicians Ashok Chavan, Prithviraj Chavan, Balasaheb Thorat and Wadettiwar were camping in Mumbai for negotiations with the NCP.  They had a marathon meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar at his home to take stock of the situation after Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis submitted his resignation to the governor and was asked to continue as caretaker chief minister. ""Fadnavis is escaping from the situation,"" Thorat said. He said the consensus was that all-out efforts should be made for the formation of a non-BJP government. Significantly, Thorat declined to reply on a direct question if the Congress-NCP will support a Shiv Sena-led government. ""There is no such proposal before the Congress-NCP front,'' Thorat said. Ashok Chavan blamed governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for the delay in formation of government. ""If no political party comes forward to stake claim, then the governor invites the single-largest party for the formation of government. It appears that no political party was called to stake claim,"" he said. The Congress MLA-elects were put up at a luxury resort on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, said a party politician. AICC general secretary in-charge of the state Avinash Pande, the Nagpur man credited with bringing Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot to power, reached Jaipur by evening. ""MLAs are coming for sightseeing in Rajasthan,"" he said. Gehlot said the BJP had spoiled the political climate by poaching MLAs all over. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra assembly polls: Turncoats bring battle for survival to Sharad Pawar’s home ground | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The sugar cane fields that dot the soil-rich and water-content western Maharashtra have long been considered the lifeline of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s politics. It’s here that the stalwart is now fighting his fiercest battle against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Pawar and his satraps have dominated the sugar and milk cooperatives, educational and financial institutes that span the region for decades. But the tide is ebbing for the party. The NCP’s core influencers here like the Mohite-Patil family of Solapur, the royal family of Bhosales in Satara, the Mahadik family in Kolhapur and leaders like Jaykumar Gore, Dilip Sopal, Rashmi Bagal and Madan Bhosale have now switched sides and thrown their weight behind the BJP or the Shiv Sena. The defections have rattled Pawar. He didn’t mince words while addressing his party workers recently. During his rally in Solapur on September 17, Pawar told his supporters that he was still capable of sending people back home and would prop up youths to win this election. The Congress and the NCP are relying on Pawar’s leadership, acumen and experience to face the BJP which overran all other political parties in the 2014 election. The BJP had managed to breach the Pawar bastion but could not win a single seat in Satara district. It may change this time now that Udayanraje Bhosale, the 13th descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, has joined the party. His cousin and MLA Shivendraraje has also joined the BJP. Between them, the two cousins virtually still rule Satara district. Political pundits are calling this assembly election a battle for survival for the NCP. Though the party won four seats in the state in the Lok Sabha elections, aggressive politics by the BJP has upset traditional political calculations in the region. The Congress and the NCP are finding it difficult to find strong candidates in several constituencies of western Maharashtra, where, till a few years ago, it was spoilt for choice. The Congress finds itself on a more slippery wicket. In 2014, it won a few seats from this region. The challenge in 2019 is to retain them. Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan and former chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde’s daughter Praniti Shinde and Vishwajeet Kadam have their tasks cut out in the changed political scenario. On the other hand, the BJP has already taken the lead in campaigning in the region. While chief minister Devendra Fadnavis led the Mahajanadesh Yatra in the region, party chief Amit Shah addressed a huge public rally in Solapur on September 1. Senior Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil’s entry into the BJP after the Lok Sabha elections and his son’s election to Parliament have boosted BJP’s party’s chances in Ahmednagar district. Radhakrishna represented the Shirdi constituency and will strive to win most of the 12 seats in the district. Such defections are not the only reason the Congress and the NCP have landed in a crisis. The BJP has not lost any opportunity to expand its base in the past five years. A majority of the sugar factories in the region were served with notices for their failure to pay fair remunerative price to the farmers. The BJP claimed that the notices were served to protect the interests of sugar cane growing farmers. With the weakening of the cooperative institutions, the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party may find the going tough. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra elections: Shiv Sena to woo voters from deprived communities | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Considering the huge response received by Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), which bagged over 41 lakh votes in the 2019 LS polls, saffron partner Shiv Sena is trying to woo deprived community voters.

Sena president Uddhav Thackeray taunted BJP, saying that smaller allies will show it (BJP) its place.  Thackeray held a press conference at Rang Sharda auditorium in Bandra along with leaders like former Congress MLA and prominent leader of Dhangars, Prakash Shendge, Congress MLC and OBC Haribhau Rathod and others who were earlier with Congress-NCP who decided to support Sena for the polls. Thackeray assured them, ""I will not sit quiet till I have fulfilled promises given to you. If there are legal issues, we will use the out-of-court tool, like assembly or Lok Sabha to solve issues related to the communities.""

"Maharashtra election 2019: BJP looks to improve tally; Sena, oppn for political space | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Apart from testing the fortunes of ruling BJP and incumbent chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, the next month's assembly polls in Maharashtra pose a tough challenge to the Opposition bloc, especially to NCP chief Sharad Pawar, beset with defections to the ruling camp. The Election Commission of India on Saturday announced a single-phase poll for Maharashtra which will be held on October 21. Counting of votes will be taken up on October 24. This will also be the first assembly election under the Narendra Modi government and also first after the April- May Lok Sabha polls, which handed a massive mandate to the Narendra Modi government. The BJP, led by Fadnavis, is looking to better its 2014 tally of 122 seats in the 288-member House. With the BJP taking centrestage even in Lok Sabha polls contested in 2014 and 2019, the Congress's hold in its strongholds of Vidarbha, Marathwada and Mumbai region has weakened. Similarly, the NCP is struggling to retain its pocket-borough of western Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena has retained its base in Konkan. In a clever strategy, the BJP has been inducting leaders from the NCP and the Congress since the last few months to expand its footprint in the regions where the party lacks organisational base. The BJP's tactic is not only proving to be psychologically advantageous for the saffron party but it is also a signal to the Uddhav Thackeray-led party to be ready to play the second fiddle in the state politics. The BJP and the Sena are locked in a tug-of-war over sharing of the 288 seats. Through his 'Maha Janadesh Yatra', Fadnavis travelled a distance of 4000 kms covering 140 assembly constituencies. The yatra concluded in Nashik on September 19 in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. For Sharad Pawar, it could be the toughest battle in his political career spanning over five decades. It was evident from speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and earlier of BJP chief Amit Shah that the BJP has been strategically attacking Pawar. Apart from raising issues like farm loan waiver and development, indications are that the BJP would milk the withdrawal of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 to push its nationalist agenda. On the other hand, the Congress and the NCP are targetting the government on agrarian distress, drought, the economic ""slowdown"" and ""joblessness"". In 2014 polls, both the Sena-BJP and the NCP-Congress alliances ruptured ahead of elections. After the four-way contest, the BJP emerged as the single largest party, followed by the Sena (63), Congress (42) and the NCP (41). The Sena later joined the government but with a bruised ego. While the BJP and the Sena are yet to arrive at a consensus on the seat-sharing formula, the Congress and the NCP have already sealed the deal to contest 125 seats each. The Opposition bloc will leave 38 seats for smaller allies. As far as the Congress is concerned, the party appears rudderless in the state which once used to be its stronghold. Many leaders of the party, including former Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and former minister Harshvardhan Patil, have joined the BJP. While sitting MLAs Nirmala Gavit, Bhausaheb Kambale and Abdul Sattar have joined the Shiv Sena, MLAs Kalidas Kolambkar and Jaykumar Gore have crossed over to the BJP. Former Mumbai Congress president Kripashankar Singh, a north Indian leader who wields clout in some pockets, has also quit the party. Though he has not opened his cards on his future political move, speculation is that he might join the BJP. Bahujan Vikas Agadhi (BVA) MLA Vilas Tare has joined the Sena. Prominent defectors from the NCP who have switched loyalties to the BJP are former minister and Navi Mumbai strongman Ganesh Naik, who was with Pawar for at least two decades, and Udayanraje Bhosale, a direct descendant of warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Bhosale had resigned from his Parliamentary membership from Satara in western Maharashtra before joining the BJP in Delhi in the presence of party chief and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Those from the NCP fold who have switched their allegiance to the BJP are MLAs Sandeep Naik, Vaibhav Pichad, and Rana Jagjitsinh. Former party MPs Dhananjay Mahadik and Sanjeev Naik have also joined the BJP. Leaders from Pawar's party who have joined the Sena are sitting MLAs Pandurang Barora, Shivendraraje Bhosale, Avdhoot Tatkare and his father and former MLC Anil Tatkare, Dilip Sopal and former state unit president Bhaskar Jadhav. Former NCP MLAs Sachin Ahir and Madhukar Pichad, who had served as ministers in the erstwhile Democratic Front (DF) government in the state, have also joined the Sena. Both of them were considered close to Pawar. According to a senior Congress leader, the deserters have switched sides considering local political equations, but they are not being able to dent the party's organisation at the local level. The Congress and the NCP had been in power for three consecutive terms before they lost to the BJP in 2014. Though the previous governments were headed by the Congress, it was the NCP which represented plum portfolios. In contrast, incumbent CM Fadnavis is firm in saddle. He is only the second chief minister, and first non-Congress one, to complete the full five-year term in office. Congress' Vasantrao Naik had held the post of chief minister for eleven long years. The Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), comprising the AIMIM, adds another dimention to the fragmented politics of the state, which has sizable Dalit and Muslim pockets. In the Lok Sabha polls, the VBA had played spoilsport for the candidates of the Congress and the NCP by causing division of votes, which ultimately benefitted the NDA. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) of Raj Thackeray, which is battling for political survival, has also vowed to contest. In Lok Sabha polls, the MNS had extended its support to the Opposition bloc.

Maharashtra elections: Traffic snarls choke bustling Andheri East despite Metro | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Pratibha Dhanavare (50) applies tilak on Shiv Sena MLA Ramesh Latke’s forehead as he makes his way through the narrow lanes of Koldongri, a suburban business district of Andheri East, urging people to vote for the bow and arrow. “It has been nine years that we moved out of chawls and into SRA buildings. Why should we choose any other party?” asks Dhanavare. Though not many share her adulation, they say they may vote for the Sena-BJP alliance for want of a formidable alternative. Residents complain of traffic bottlenecks and congestion, slow pace of redevelopment and water issues triggered by rapidly growing projects. While Census 2011 pegs the population at over 8 lakh, an estimated 15 lakh people come here every day to work. “Andheri is bursting at the seams...Traffic is frustrating despite the Metro,” says designer Anchal Pradhan, who takes over an hour to commute between Andheri east and west. Andheri transformed from a manufacturing hub to a corporate destination owing to its connectivity with both eastern and western suburbs via JVLR. While Sahar Elevated Road and Ghatkopar-Versova Metro improved connectivity, congestion on the roads seems to have become the area’s biggest bane. “Roads on almost every major signal are broken, which slows down traffic. Our priority will be to fix them,” Latke told TOI. Residents of Marol and MIDC complained that the two major hospitals —ESIC and SevenHills— lie defunct. Latke said his party has raised ESIC’s issue at the Centre. Five candidates are vying for the seat in 2019, including Congress corporator from Vile Parle Jagdish Amin and Latke. “The MLA has overlooked issues like mushrooming of illegal hotels close to the airport or that water supply is being controlled by the mafia,” Amin said, adding the party would work towards traffic decongestion and better roads if voted to power.

AIMIM candidate pulls out of Maharashtra assembly elections from Mumbra-Kalwa constituency | Thane News - Times of India,"THANE: Withdrawal of the AIMIM candidate from the Kalwa-Mumbra assembly segment has triggered a rage among the party functionaries here. The candidate, Barkatulla Shaikh aka Gunjanseth was nominated in the Kalwa-Mumbra constituency in a tight battle against the two-time NCP candidate Jitendra Awhad, at a time when the other members, including party head for Mumbra Rauf Lala, were aggressively campaigning against Awhad since the last couple of months. All the hopes went crashing when Gunjanseth suddenly withdrew his candidature leaving the cadre in shock and anger. Speaking to TOI, Lala alleged, ""As the selection of the candidates started, I was very doubtful about the candidate owing to his record of switching over and joining hands with the opposition candidate. Time and again I alerted the top-brass about him but they completely ignored my pleas and later even stopped taking my calls. After his withdrawal, now all the party functionaries are left helpless as we intend to take the NCP candidate head-on exposing his false claims of development.” Speaking to TOI, Imtiaz Jaleel the state head of AIMIM, ""I had no role in selecting the candidate for Thane-Mumbai, I was given the task of selecting candidates for the rest of Maharashtra. It is very unfortunate and we have taken strict action against the candidate.” On the other hand, the AIMIM has suspended the membership of the candidate. In a press release issued by Jaleel on behalf of the AIMIM stated that ""..we have removed Gunjan Seth from the primary membership of the AIMIM for cheating and betraying the trust of the party by withdrawing his nomination papers from the Mumbra assembly constituency.' The release further stated that Seth has let down the entire community in Mumbra for his financial benefits.

Maharashtra elections: CM Devendra Fadnavis wins over Vidarbha with heavy-duty projects | Mumbai News - Times of India,"During the 2014 assembly polls, when Devendra Fadnavis was state Bharatiya Janata Party chief, speculation was rife that Vidarbha’s ‘son of the soil’ might get the coveted chair of chief minister. TOI published a report saying as much on October 17, 2014, based on the claims of top BJP leaders. At the time, there were many contenders for the post, including senior leaders like Eknath Khadse and even former deputy chief minister Gopinath Munde’s daughter Pankaja. Five years down the line, there is little doubt that if BJP-Sena win the state polls, Fadnavis would continue to be chief minister. Unlike other chief ministers who neglected Vidarbha, Fadnavis has strengthened his ties with the region through regular visits and a series of decisions aimed at reducing the development backlog which Vidarbha has historically suffered. “We are not voting this time for our MLA, but for our chief minister. With the kind of development works he initiated not only in his constituency, but in the whole of Maharashtra and Vidarbha, he’s an ideal choice for the entire state for the top post,” said Uday Dable, Fadnavis’s lawyer and a resident of the chief minister’s Nagpur South West constituency. Along with Union minister Nitin Gadkari, a fellow Vidarbha native, Fadnavis initiated projects across a range of sectors, including Metro rail and the Nagpur-Mumbai expressway. He has also cleared the decks for premier nationallevel institutions like AIIMS, IIM, IIIT, NLU and Symbiosis International University (SIU) to be set up in the region (see box). In 2014, Fadnavis, a Brahmin, became the state’s second youngest chief minister after Maratha strongman Sharad Pawar. A Brahmin chief minister is considered a politically incorrect proposition in Maharashtra, given the heavy Maratha-OBC quotient in state politics and the long-drawn Left-Socialist progressive movement in the state, say observers. But Fadnavis' caste didn’t seem to worry the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “It's time we went beyond caste considerations,” a party leader had said at the time.

Maharashtra elections: 'MKVDC projects stopped during Congress-NCP rule' | Pune News - Times of India,"Udayanraje Bhosale has earned the moniker 'Maharaj' for not just being the 13th descendant of the Maratha warrior king, Chhatrapati Shivaji, but also for expressing his views unhesitatingly. A popular figure in Satara district, he outrode the Modi wave to win the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He followed it up with a victory in this year's LS polls too after NCP chief Sharad Pawar renominated him despite stiff opposition from party leaders. And then came the shocker. Barely three months after being elected, he quit the NCP to join the BJP. While his decision to switch is being attributed to local Satara politics, people close to him say he was inclined to the BJP ideology even when he entered politics in the early '90s. With Udayanraje now contesting the Satara bypoll on its ticket, the BJP aims to end the NCP dominance in the region. But Pawar has made the bypoll a prestige issue by fielding close friend Shriniwas Patil. Q: You were close to the BJP even while you were with the NCP. Don't you think your decision to join the BJP was a little late?  A: I don't think its late. People take the right decision at the right time. Q: You described yourself as the ""scorpion on Shivlinga"" in one of your speeches. Obviously, this is with reference to the NCP.  A: NCP had created many difficulties in all works, which I had opposed. They would not allow me to function because I always spoke the truth. Whether it is about corruption or some other issue, I have spoken for the pain of the people and the NCP always looked at me with some suspicion. But they never had the courage to hurt me. Q: How comfortable are you with the switch to the BJP?  A: I am confident that works which have been delayed for years can now be restarted. In the past, works suggested by me would not get administrative approval. Does administrative approval need money? I am sure the present government will sanction funds to complete works in Satara district. Q: What is the reason for so many NCP leaders joining the BJP?  A: I can speak for myself, I do not want to comment on the decision taken by others. But let me tell you that the Congress and NCP had an unending list of blunders when they were in power for 15 years. We had met deputy CM Gopinath Munde in 1996 and convinced him about how projects taken up in the Krishna valley would improve the lives of the people. The same year, Munde set up the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC). However, all these projects were delayed or stopped when the Congress-NCP came to power. The two parties did not want progress among the people. What have they done to develop Satara district, which has always supported them? Q: You have turned a bitter critic of your friends in the NCP...  A: I am their bitter critic but there is no bitterness. I still enjoying chatting with them and I'm sure they enjoy it too. The difference here is between issues and individuals. Why should I forget the time they neglected issues because of an individual? On the other hand, Modi and Shah are into progressive politics where issues are more important than individuals. In fact, this has been the main factor for me joining the BJP.

Maharashtra elections: 'MKVDC projects stopped during Congress-NCP rule' | Maharashtra Election News - Times of India,"Udayanraje Bhosale has earned the moniker 'Maharaj' for not just being the 13th descendant of the Maratha warrior king, Chhatrapati Shivaji, but also for expressing his views unhesitatingly. A popular figure in Satara district, he outrode the Modi wave to win the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He followed it up with a victory in this year's LS polls too after NCP chief Sharad Pawar renominated him despite stiff opposition from party leaders. And then came the shocker. Barely three months after being elected, he quit the NCP to join the BJP. While his decision to switch is being attributed to local Satara politics, people close to him say he was inclined to the BJP ideology even when he entered politics in the early '90s. With Udayanraje now contesting the Satara bypoll on its ticket, the BJP aims to end the NCP dominance in the region. But Pawar has made the bypoll a prestige issue by fielding close friend Shriniwas Patil. Q: You were close to the BJP even while you were with the NCP. Don't you think your decision to join the BJP was a little late?  A: I don't think its late. People take the right decision at the right time. Q: You described yourself as the ""scorpion on Shivlinga"" in one of your speeches. Obviously, this is with reference to the NCP.  A: NCP had created many difficulties in all works, which I had opposed. They would not allow me to function because I always spoke the truth. Whether it is about corruption or some other issue, I have spoken for the pain of the people and the NCP always looked at me with some suspicion. But they never had the courage to hurt me. Q: How comfortable are you with the switch to the BJP?  A: I am confident that works which have been delayed for years can now be restarted. In the past, works suggested by me would not get administrative approval. Does administrative approval need money? I am sure the present government will sanction funds to complete works in Satara district. Q: What is the reason for so many NCP leaders joining the BJP?  A: I can speak for myself, I do not want to comment on the decision taken by others. But let me tell you that the Congress and NCP had an unending list of blunders when they were in power for 15 years. We had met deputy CM Gopinath Munde in 1996 and convinced him about how projects taken up in the Krishna valley would improve the lives of the people. The same year, Munde set up the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC). However, all these projects were delayed or stopped when the Congress-NCP came to power. The two parties did not want progress among the people. What have they done to develop Satara district, which has always supported them? Q: You have turned a bitter critic of your friends in the NCP...  A: I am their bitter critic but there is no bitterness. I still enjoying chatting with them and I'm sure they enjoy it too. The difference here is between issues and individuals. Why should I forget the time they neglected issues because of an individual? On the other hand, Modi and Shah are into progressive politics where issues are more important than individuals. In fact, this has been the main factor for me joining the BJP. Modi and Shah want to make India a superpower. Other political parties do not have this vision. You cannot stop the people from coming together if they have common ideas and thoughts.

He was speaking at a public rally in Rahatni on Thursday. Efforts will be taken to stop every drop of untreated sewage from entering the rivers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in the next four years, he added. ""Untreated sewage enters Indrayani, Mula, Mutha and other rivers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.

"Man who's taken on Aaditya Thackeray: Self-styled neta turns reality TV star, now hopes to turn CM | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Abhijeet Bichukale is feeling used. Moments ago, he plucked off his mike from his T-shirt and stormed out of a live panel show in Chembur. A friend who brought him to the show is now guiltily trying to calm him down with a hug. Things had begun well here if you discount the part when the anchor mispronounced Bichukale's surname-slash-village-name and he demanded an edit before someone reminded him that it's a live stream. What followed was a round of questions and song requests that have become almost rote for this 43-year-old self-styled politician from Satara-turned-Marathi reality show contestant-turned-entertaining independent candidate from Worli constituency. The mood shifted when a journalist asked him: ""The Sena has been in power in this city for long. Your fame here is sudden. What's your game plan?"" ""Sudden?"" asked the henna-haired Bichukale, reminding her that he had ""gone grey"" having contested and failed in every possible election -from Lok Sabha polls to the presidential elections-since 2004 in Satara before reality TV found him and that it's his celebrityhood that has now lent ""glamour"" to the Vidhan Sabha polls in Mumbai where he is up against Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray. ""Kavimanache nete"" Bichukale may have the heart of a poet, but his head belongs to an actor who wants to be taken seriously. It prefers the company of those who respect his stature. Right now, economics is weighing heavily on the head of this 43-year-old independent candidate whose poll affidavit shows his declared income of the last five years as 'nil'. Bichukale, who had been recently arrested from the sets of a Marathi reality show in a cheque-bouncing case in Satara, is asking friends over the phone for monetary help. Apart from his Worli-based uncle's goodwill and his own viral fame, the candidate-who has never got more than 2,000 votes in an election- says he is banking on the principle of ""multi-level marketing"" for support. ""Tell your friends in Worli,"" Bichukale requests a couple of fans in a cake shop in Chembur after they take a selfie with him, and gives them his phone number unsolicited. ""Tell your friends in Worli. Abhijeet Bichukale,"" he repeats looking at the cake shop salesman, who also takes a selfie with the man, despite not quite knowing who he is. For Worli constituency, Bichukale-who wears faux leather jackets and obsessively smooths his long hair-is at worst, a WhatsApp meme and, at best, a colourful alternative for NOTA. Someone who is not only prone to Bollywood-inspired flourishes like "" Ek baar commitment kar di, toh main apni kya, khuda ki bhi nahi sunta,"" but also someone who likes to call the AB form, which contesting candidates are required to submit, the 'Abhijit Bichukale form'. ""Mumbai doesn't belong to anyone...except for my heroes Gadge Maharaj, Babasaheb Ambedkar and Tukaram,"" says Bichukale, when asked about his decision to go up against Aaditya. As ""Chhatrapati Shivaji's ideological heir"", Bichukale secretly reveres his longtime rival in Satara, Shivaji descendant Udayanraje Bhosale, like an ""elder brother"". He has also filed his nomination in Satara this election against BJP's Shivendra Bhosale. Smitten with the stylish, so cialist heroes he saw on TV, Bichukale decided to be a ""real-life hero"" and shine light on the need for rural developme- nt by first standing for polls in 2004. What his consistent failure in polls has taught him is that ""social work has nothing to do with politics. Politics is about addressing voters' concerns"". In Worli, for instance, he says he wants to focus on redevelopment of BDD chawls among other issues. When asked about the Rs 10 meal idea that is part of the Sena promises, he reminds you of the defunct zunka-bhakar stalls and the party's failure to deliver on the Re 1 meal promise. Bichukale's five-year-plan is to become Maharashtra chief minister in 2024. ""Abraham Lincoln became the US president at the age of 71. I hope Worli votes for me so I don't have to wait that long,"" says the father of two, who claims to have declined five film offers to be the ""common man's voice"" in the constituency.

Maharashtra elections: 10% discount at select food joints for voters | Nagpur News - Times of India,"NAGPUR: Casting your vote will now get you a 10% discount on the food bill at select restaurants in the city. The Nagpur Residential Hotels Association (NRHA) has decided to offer the discount in a bid to encourage voting. The association’s president Tejinder Singh Renu said, “We believe that voting is not only a fundamental right, but a duty. This is just a small step from our side to ensure that people go out and cast their vote.” Micky Arora, promoter of Hotel Centre Point (Ramdaspeth) said he is happy to be part of this initiative. “Revenue is not important all the time. Voting is a big responsibility and we must do everything in our power to encourage people to exercise their franchise,” said Arora. This discount is applicable only to those restaurants that are part of a residential hotel. In addition, the hotels need to be members of NRHA. The discount bonanza is not limited only to NRHA members as voters can enjoy discounts ranging from 10%-25% at resorts in Pench. A press communique issued by Ramtek’s sub-divisional officer Jogendra Katyare informed that the voters would be offered these concessions after they show the proof of voting — the indelible ink mark on the finger. The concession would continue till 15 days from the polling day (October 21) and will only be applicable for voters from Maharashtra. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"BJP health plans ambitious, yet realistic: Experts | Nagpur News - Times of India","NAGPUR: Right from screening every 30-year-old individual for diseases to ending cataract blindness cases in two years, BJP’s health manifesto is full of many ambitious promises. Many of these promises are extension of the existing schemes. Apart from affordable health services and medical tests for common people, the manifesto speaks about ensuring enough number of MBBS doctors in the state, and increasing seats for MBBS and MD students in future. Doctors said government has to increase health expenditure substantially to achieve these goals. While speaking on cataract-free Maharashtra goal, which finds prominent mention in the manifesto, Dr TP Lahane, who holds world record of performing highest number of cataract surgeries, said it is very much possible. “Cataract-free means ending blindness due to cataract. We can achieve this by performing free surgeries, particularly in rural areas. Maharashtra has already done a good job in this field,” Dr Lahane said. BJP has given preference to diagnosis and treatment of non-communicable diseases. Working president of the party JP Nadda, who released the manifesto, announced that every individual in Maharashtra will be screened for BP, sugar, TB, leprosy, and oral health. Doctors have welcomed this initiative. “Screening every individual for non-communicable diseases appears to be a major step towards community health. Even at present, the government is running such screening programmes. The announcement appears to be an extension of existing scheme. Its success depends on how effectively they implement it,” said Dr YS Deshpande, former state president of the Indian Medical Association. On BJP’s plan to expand the limit of health insurance schemes, most private doctors have their reservations. “It’s good to provide health insurance to more and more citizens. But, the government rates for surgeries and treatment under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) are very less. If BJP wants to bring more hospitals under the scheme, it must increase this amount,” said a doctor from a prominent hospital chain, who was not willing to be named. Doctors from government set-up think that the plans for government hospitals are achievable only if state increases its health budget. A senior official of directorate of health services told TOI that upgradation and set-up of new units as promised in the manifesto needs major budgetary provisions. BJP has promised to increase seats in medical colleges, and to end the crisis of doctors in rural areas in five years. “Increasing seats in medical colleges is very much possible. More seats and perks to students working in rural areas will ensure enough doctors in government set-ups. This is long term goal, but quite realistic one,” said a senior official from Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS). Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra elections: Common effluent treatment plant needed for industries under Pimpri Chinchwad’s jurisdiction | Pune News - Times of India,"PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A common effluent treatment plant (CETP) needed for treating the effluents of industries in Pimpri Chinchwad has not materialized in the past 20 years. Activists participating in the Citizen Manifesto organized by The Times of India expressed the need for such a plant to reduce river pollution.  Suryakant Muthiyan, executive president, Federation of Pimpri Chinchwad Senior Citizens Organisation said, “People are dumping debris in the blue floodline area of the Pavana river which leads to floods in adjacent areas. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has built sewage treatment plants (STP) at many places to treat the domestic sewage but the civic body releases untreated sewage directly into river when there is power failure.” Activists have been demanding a common treatment plant to reduce this pollution for the past 20 years, he added. Bhosari BJP associate MLA, Mahesh Landge, replying to this demand said, “We had directed the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) to set up a common treatment plant. MIDC had allotted land for the project but later it transpired that the land had been allotted to someone else.

The Election Commission had received 5,543 applications for all the 288 segments, an official said on Monday, adding that 3,239 nominees are left in the race after withdrawals and rejection of 800 applications due to technical errors. Congress candidate Ashish Deshmukh filed his nomination papers from South West Nagpur constituency for the Maharashtra assembly elections.The official said more than 15 candidates are in the race in 34 constituencies, prompting the poll body to allocate additional Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) to accommodate all the nominees. Unlike previous polls, rebellions have hit all the parties, especially the ruling BJP, after allotment of tickets. The BJP leadership tried hard to convince dissenters to withdraw from the fray against the official candidates of the party. Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had issued a warning that the rebels would have no place in the alliance if they don't fall in line. While only three contestants are in the poll arena from Chiplun seat in Ratnagiri district which is the lowest number in the state, the highest number of candidates at 38 are vying to win Nanded South constituency in Marathwada region.

"Satish Uke in high court over inaction by returning officer, EC in Maharashtra CM’s form case | Nagpur News - Times of India","NAGPUR: Advocate Satish Uke, who challenged chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ nomination form, has filed a criminal writ petition in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court over alleged inaction of Election Commission authorities and Sadar police station. Uke had filed a series of complaints against Fadnavis, his associates, and Nagpur South-West constituency returning officer Shekhar Ghadge. Meanwhile, on Monday, the HC dismissed a petition filed by activist Janardhan Moon alleging violation of code of conduct by the CM. The HC has registered Uke’s petition filed through Abhiyan Barahate and Vaibhav Jagtap, and scheduled pre-admission hearing on October 14. Uke has filed the latest petition in the capacity of a voter from Nagpur South-West constituency from where the CM is one of the contestants. He has made Election Commission of India (ECI), state’s chief electoral officer, Sadar PI, district election officer, and observer of South-West constituency as respondents. Fadnavis is not a respondent in the case. Uke is also pursuing a petition against Fadnavis’ 2014 nomination form and affidavit for last five years. He got some success in the Supreme Court, which directed a hearing of the case in the district and sessions court. In the latest petition filed under Article 226 and 227 of Constitution of India, Uke prayed for directions to the respondents to take cognisance and appropriate action on three complaints lodged by him on October 6. TOI had, on Monday, highlighted Uke’s all three complaints, where he demanded rejection of CM’s nomination form, challenged one order and two corrigenda of Ghadge approving Fadnavis’ form, and filing of offences against CM, his associates, and Ghadge under sections of Representation of Peoples Act 1951, IPC, and Prevention of Corruption Act. Uke’s petition highlights his complaint about Ghadge and demands rejection of CM’s nomination form over an invalid affidavit. He also explained in detail how Ghadge’s order considers registration certificate of different notary. He also mentioned two back-dated corrigenda issued by Ghadge. Uke said, “All acts related to the case are nothing but murder of Constitutional rights of voters, democracy, election process and cheating with state by RO.” He also said, “The petitioner submitted complaints with all respondents to seize computers, CCTVs and mobile handset of RO to protect the evidence, but received no response. The instant petition is limited to this inaction of respondents.” Uke made some fresh allegations against RO, CM and his associates in the petition. “Nomination forms were supposed to be accepted up to 3pm on October 4. No additional documents can be attached after 3pm. It was mandatory for RO to publish affidavit and form of all candidates, including CM, on notice board, which was not done. It is learnt RO was busy in getting loopholes in Fadnavis’ form cured so he did not publish the affidavit on notice board. Entire corridor up to RO’s office was barricaded and under police force. Only after petitioner’s complaint at about 5.45-6pm that RO came, apologized, opened the corridor for public, and published the affidavit,” he said. Uke also alleged, “RO adjourned hearing to October 5 considering signals of Fadnavis’ associates. RO did not conduct panchnama of sealed envelop comprising nomination form of Fadnavis despite repeated requests of petitioner and others.” In Moon’s petition, his lawyer Ashwin Ingole had alleged inaction by district collector on his complaint against the CM. “Chief minister of Maharashtra misused the official position and used the official letterhead to lure voters of Nagpur South-West constituency on October 3, and violated the model code of conduct,” he said. The HC questioned the locus standi of the complainant before rejecting the petition. HC also observed that since Moon has already approached the State Election Commission regarding this, the latter will deal with the matter. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra assembly elections: Housing societies take lead for better polling | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Several housing societies have, instead of waiting for an order from the cooperation department, come forward to appoint their office bearers as booth-level volunteers to ensure a better voter turnout in the October 21 Maharashtra assembly elections. The Lok Sabha elections earlier this year had seen a little over than 60% turnout in the state, following which the election department targeted to ensure that at least 70% people got inked during the assembly polls. Volunteers working on the ground to improve the voters’ awareness are unhappy with the cooperation department’s delay in issuing the mandatory appeal to the housing societies. “Once the Election Commission of India issues us the direction, we will immediately issue the order to the housing societies,” a senior cooperation department official said. The government, through the cooperation department and collectorates, has to remind all housing societies — registered and unregistered — about its seven-year-old directive to make their respective presidents and secretaries as boothlevel volunteers to ensure 100% voting. The cooperation department had in 2012 directed the office-bearers of housing societies to conduct audit of their respective units and prepare a list of the shifted, dead and new voters before July 31every year. The ground-level volunteers felt that “it’s too late to issue the order”, particularly in the urban assembly constituencies that have seen considerable apathy of the voters in the last LS elections and the polls in the past. “Why can’t the department get proactive and do its bit to activate all the registered housing societies and ensure better polling?” asked Indrani Malkani, managing trustee of V Citizens Action Network that has been aggressively working towards leading the voters to the booths in Mumbai. Representatives of the Maharashtra Cooperative Housing Society Federation’s Pune chapter said “order or no order”, they had to do their bit to ensure good participation of the voters. Suhas Patwardhan (see pic), Pune president and state vicepresident of the Maharashtra Cooperative Housing Society Federation, said, “We have 18,000 housing societies in the district and have issued a circular to ensure that there is a maximum turnout of voters. We have mobilized the housing societies without waiting for the formal orders.” Avadhoot Johari, secretary of Happy Colony that has 52 society associations with over 5,000 voters, said, “We have scheduled meetings and formed a group on the social media to encourage a better turnout of voters.” Sudhir Deshmukh, founder member of the PCMC Housing Societies Federation and a member of the Hinjewadi residents’ association, said process was on to make the residents aware about the issues plaguing the area and as well as the use of the NOTA option in the electronic voting machine. Wanowrie Residents’ Forum member Maithali Manakwad said they were conducting “Mohalla” committee meetings to boost voter awareness. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Poll code looms large over crucial canal advisory water meeting | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: The all important Canal Advisory (CAC) annual meeting scheduled on October 15 is all set to be cancelled due to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC). CAC is an authority body for major irrigation projects in Maharashtra. The Maharashtra Water Resources Department (WRD) minister, who heads the committee, decides the allocation of water for irrigation after considering drinking water. Jayakwadi dam from Aurangabad district and Lower Dudhna from Parbhani district are among two major irrigation projects from Marathwada, for which CAC was expected to hold a meeting on October 15. WRD authorities said they were uncertain whether the meeting will take place on time. A senior official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We have already sought the requirement of drinking water from different district administrations. Based on these needs, the amount of water for irrigation purposes will be decided. It is unclear whether the CAC meeting will be held as per the schedule.” The left bank canal system of Jayakwadi dam has irrigable command area of around 1,41,640 hectare spread over Aurangabad (7,620 hectare) , Jalna (36,580 hectare) and Parbhani (97,440 hectare) districts. The irrigable command area of right bank canal system is nearly 41,682 which includes Aurangabad (1,432 hectare)and Beed (37,960 hectare) from Marathwada besides Ahmednagar (2,290 hectare). With the majority of Marathwada continuing to receive deficient rainfall, the CAC meeting is expected to play a crucial role in deciding the water for non-irrigation needs also. Farmer activist Jayaji Suryawanshi said the CAC meeting was likely to get postponed considerably. “The meeting will not take place immediately after MCC gets over. The allocation of portfolio has to take place to decide WRD minister and therefore a lot of time could get wasted,” he said. Upcoming Rabi season of crops require irrigation in beneficiary areas from the command areas of dams. “The CAC meeting decides number of rotations of water and the amount that has to be released from the dam. It helps the farmers to decide their cropping pattern and sowing time. The CAC meeting should be arranged at the WRD authorities level if the minister cannot attend it,” Suryawanshi said. While Jayakwadi dam is filled with 100% live storage currently, Lower Dudhna is still shows dead storage (-17%). Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Ex-CM Prithviraj Chavan and MLAs ‘wooed by BJP’ on Congress list | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The AICC on Wednesday nominated former CM Prithviraj Chavan from Karad (South) for the assembly elections, while Dhiraj, son of former CM Vilasrao Deshmukh, will contest from Latur (rural). They were among 52 Congress nominees declared by the Congress on Wednesday. Initially, the AICC had asked Chavan to contest the byelection for the Satara Lok Sabha seat against Udayan Raje Bhosale, who resigned from NCP and joined BJP recently. In fact, Chavan’s name did not figure in the first list of Congress candidates. However, following his meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the AICC agreed to nominate him for the assembly elections. A Congress leader said the nomination of two legislators, Kunal Patil from Dhule (rural) and Rahul Bondre (Chikhali) assumes importance as they were among the several Congress legislators being lured by the BJP. “It’s a fact that many Congress legislators were on their way to joining the BJP and Shiv Sena on the eve of the polls following mounting pressure from the BJP. I am sure they will not fall into the trap,” Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. A former Congress minister said there was no doubt initially an exodus from the party, and leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil too resigned from the party and joined the BJP, but the Congress has now been able to stem it. “We have accommodated most legislators.

The Pune Cantonment assembly segment has the highest number of valid candidates — 58. A total of 85 candidates had thrown their hat in the ring, but election officials had rejected 27 forms. City unit chief if Congress Ramesh Bagwe is in the fray for this seat and will lock horns with BJP candidate Sunil Kamble, the chairman of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s powerful standing committee.

Maharashtra assembly polls: Why modernity continues to elude Pune Cantonment | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The real estate diversity within the Pune Cantonment assembly constituency is sharply defined. It has some of the city’s most expensive neighbourhoods such as Koregaon Park. And barely a few kilometres from these tony parts are residents struggling to re-develop homes that are decades old. The enclaves that come directly under the Pune Cantonment Board limits have been struggling to modernise because of restrictions on floor space index (FSI) and redevelopment. One businessman said he had obtained permission from the PCB to renovate a property he had purchased. He demolished and reconstructed the entire property before renting it out, but the PCB still hasn’t given him the demolition permit. There have been glaring instances of residents involved with illegal constructions because most of the time, the PCB hands out permits for repairs and not for entire reconstruction or overhaul of buildings. The assembly elections on October 21 have revived hopes among residents that long-pending demands — increase in FSI or permits to construct buildings up to the built-up area — will finally be approved. For the record, FSI within the Pune cantonment’s civilian area is 1 and bungalow area is 0.5. The FSI in areas coming under the PMC is 2. The housing conundrum has led to a decline in the population in the PCB areas as a large number of its residents has moved to areas under PMC limits. Many said they faced difficulties while seeking repair and reconstruction permissions. Others said the procedure to transfer or sell properties was tedious. And there is no scope to develop parking spaces. Also, land that has been given to residents on long lease by the central government cannot be easily converted into freehold properties. The problem of limited FSI has been debated by MPs, MLAs and other elected representatives from the area. But there has been no resolution as the Southern Command, headquartered here, has objected to an increase in building space by citing environmental concerns. Legal experts who have handled cantonment cases and environmentalists say the army authorities have no power to increase FSI under the Cantonments Act, 2006. The late Manohar Parrikar, during his stint as defence minister, had secured permission for old properties built prior to 1984 to use the same FSI while rebuilding. Several MPs had urged Parrikar to get this permission, saying development across India’s 62 cantonment boards had been hit because of FSI norms. The Director General of Defence Estates (DGDE), New Delhi, then issued instructions directing cantonment boards to submit building bylaws that could allow it to take a final decision on the FSI matter. The PCB submitted draft bylaws to the DGDE for approval over a year ago, but there has been no movement since. Now, ahead of the assembly polls, politicians have again claimed they will resolve the FSI issue. Businessman Vinayak Katkar said: “The government issued a notification in 2016, allowing old properties to consume the same FSI while building anew. The government should increase FSI to boost overall development. Many buildings here are in a dangerous condition.” Activist Rajabhau Chavan said: “The FSI should be increased in Pune cantonment because the PMC has been able to improve infrastructure in the city. In Pune Camp, a large number of people have taken over government land for constructing toilets. Disputes between landlords and tenants can be settled if FSI is increased. Provision for parking, rain harvesting scheme and increase in property taxes are some of the benefits for both residents and the PCB.” Activist Sanjay Kawade said: “All the 19 cantonment boards coming under Southern Command should have the same FSI. For example, the Secunderabad cantonment has 2 FSI while the Pune cantonment has just 1. This disparity should be removed.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra assembly polls: Candidates hit the campaign trail | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: With the nomination process nearly out of the way, the candidates of all the leading political parties in the city hit the road on Saturday. They tried to make the most of the weekend and focused on door-to-door campaigning. “For many candidates said big rallies were second on their list of priorities. A clearer picture of the key contests to watch out for will only emerge on Monday, which is the last date for the withdrawal of nominations. However, those whose candidacies were assured, flagged off their campaigns on Sunday. In Kothrud, one of the most talked about constituencies this election cycle, will see state BJP president Chandrakant Patil go head-on with Maharashtra Navnirman Sena’s Kishor Shinde, who has the backing of the Congress-NCP combine. Patil attended a Shastra Pujan at the RSS’ city headquarters, and followed that up with a series of meetings with party workers and senior functionaries at his campaign office in Kothrud. Shinde visited various parts of the constituency, like Mutheshwar Colony, Sagar Colony, Karvenagar and Shreeman Society. For many candidates, the first week’s schedule was fixed. “Right now, the focus is on direct interaction with the voters, via doorstep visits and meetings with citizens’ groups. Next week onwards, senior party leaders will come to address rallies,” said Hemant Lele, campaign manager for mayor Mukta Tilak, who is contesting from Kasba Peth. Tilak, Congress’ Arvind Shinde and MNS city chief Ajay Shinde went canvassing door-to-door in areas like Lohiyanagar, Khalkar Chowk, Nimbalkar Talim and Narayanpeth. In Pune Cantonment — where city congress chief Ramesh Bagwe will take on civic standing committee chairman, BJP’s Sunil Kamble — the contestants focused on direct interactions with voters. “Our candidates are coordinating with our alliance partners so that joint campaigns can be held,” Congress’ city spokesperson Ramesh Iyer said. Sunil Tingre, the NCP candidate from Wadgaon Sheri, started early in the day by visiting a temple in Dhanori. He then met the voters at their doorstep, party workers said. Tingre takes on BJP’s sitting MLA Jagdish Mulik, who had started his campaign on Saturday with a visit to some slum pockets in the city. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
General feeling is this government has ignored core issues: Sharad Pawar | Pune News - Times of India,"At 78, Sharad Pawar still sets a brisk pace. Since elections were declared, he has covered more than 100 assembly constituencies—he addresses at least half a dozen rallies every day, mostly in the rural parts of the state. Pawar says the “dismal performance” of the government will ensure that the Congress-NCP front returns to power. A recipient of the Padma Vibhushan, Pawar spoke to TOI on the agrarian crisis, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image and challenges before the opposition. Q: What has changed since the 2019 Lok Sabha elections? A: The opposition was wiped out (in the LS polls), NCP won only four seats. But this has happened before. After Congress was defeated in 1977, Indira Gandhi made a grand comeback in 1980… 2019 polls were preceded by the Pulwama attack. Prime Minister Narendra Modi successfully raised the issue of national security and aggressively took on Pakistan. There were two options before the people: Rahul Gandhi or Modi. People chose Modi as he had succeeded in convincing the electorate that national security is of paramount importance. Q: And what will be the outcome now?A: In 2014, Congress and NCP contested elections separately. Now they have joined hands to take on the saffron combine. Discontent is brewing in all sections. People, especially the younger generation, are looking for change. Lok Sabha and assembly polls are fought on different grounds and the general perception is the Fadnavis government has ignored core issues. No steps have been taken to generate employment. Many industrial units are shut or facing closure, which will result in job loss. More than 16,000 farmers have ended their lives, but government appears to be a silent spectator. A loan waiver scheme was announced, but against a target of 90 lakh farmers, less than 20 lakh have benefited. It was expected that government will intervene to protect onion growers, but decisions taken have proved to be counterproductive. No steps have been taken for providing remunerative prices for agriculture produce. Q: What about industrial development?A: Again, measures are inadequate. While hundreds of industrial units have closed, nothing is being done for their revival. When I was the CM, at least five to six heads of industrial houses would meet me with investment proposals. Maharashtra was then the leader in both domestic and foreign direct investments. Now it has been relegated to a lower position. The automobile sector is the worst sufferer. Maharashtra is the worstaffected, many units are located here. Less said the better about demonetisation. The worst hit is the cooperative sector as RBI had banned cooperative banks from accepting notes. The decision had its fallout, two successive governors—Raghuram Rajan and Urjit Patel--quit owing to differences with government. Q: Will Article 370 resonate in an assembly election?A: I don’t think Article 370 is an issue. Modi and Amit Shah know how to divert attention away from problems, particularly during elections. In my opinion, the agrarian crisis, rising crimes against women, inflation, and law and order will be the main issues. Nagpur, the hometown of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has become a crime capital, Nagpur is one of the most cultured cities in the state and also a second capital. It has achieved the dubious distinction of being described as a crime capital. Q: You have been booked by the Enforcement Directorate in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank scamA: I was shocked when I found my name in the statement issued by the Enforcement Directorate. Mind you, there are 70 people accused in all, from all parties, but only three or four names were mentioned. I was never associated with the bank in any manner, Ajit Pawar was there, but he never attended the meetings of the loan committee. This is clear abuse of power. Agencies like ED, income tax, CBI and anticorruption bureau are being used to harass the opposition. Look at the way former union minister P Chidambaram has been arrested. It is an attempt to malign the image of honest politicians. Now, the credibility of central agencies is at stake. I have seen the Emergency, this is even worse. Q: Most of your trusted associates including Udayan Raje Bhosale, Vijaysinh Mohite Patil, Madhukar Pichad, have ditched you…A: Many of them met me before quitting the NCP. They left for two reasons: firstly out of fear, since most of them are associated with one or other society. They fear that they will face an investigation by ED, CBI, IT or ACB. The second group feels that there is no possibility of being reelected and that the present BJP-led government is all set to continue for the second term. I am confident that most defectors will be rejected by the electorate. Q: Minister Girish Mahajan said Congress-NCP together will not get more than 40 seatsA: Revenue minister Chandrakant Dada Patil, who is also state BJP president, and Mahajan, are the most resourceful ministers in the state. Let us see what happens after the elections. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra elections: Cabinet ministers’ total assets jump 80% in 5 years | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Citizens may be unsure whether PM Modi’s promised ‘Achhe Din’ has arrived or not, but it surely did for the state’s cabinet ministers. Their cumulative assets have grown by Rs 142.5 crore in the last five years, meaning an average increase of Rs 7.9 crore, shows an analysis of their poll affidavits. TOI analysed the affidavits of 18 cabinet ministers who are contesting again and their total assets came to Rs 322.5 crore, which last time was Rs 179.8 crore, showing an 80% increase. Water supply and sanitation minister Babanrao Lonikar, contesting from Partur, has shown the highest jump in assets, rising by Rs 27.1 crore in five years since 2014 (see box). The second highest increase, of Rs 21.7 crore, has been shown by Parli MLA and women and children welfare minister Pankaja Munde. The lowest increase is in the assets of Suresh Khade, the social justice minister. His wealth has grown by Rs 6 lakh, from Rs 4.88 crore in 2014 to Rs 4.94 crore. “Just because the assets are going up, we should not think there is something fishy. One has to allow the benefit of doubt that the increase may have been through legitimate means. Also, one should check that the rate of increase of these assets is also the rate of growth in the economy and whether the per capita income also went up by the same MLC in 2014. Besides the four MLC ministers, Sena has only Jaydatta Kshirsagar, who joined the party earlier this year, on the list of gainers among cabinet ministers. It’s other cabinet minister, Eknath Shinde, falls neither in the highest nor lowest growth category. His assets were Rs 7.5 crore in 2014 and have gone up to Rs 11.6 crore, an increase of Rs 4.1 crore Lonikar’s affidavit includes his, his spouse’s and a dependent’s assets. He has declaamount,” said Milind Mhaske, director Praja Foundation. There are 25 cabinet ministers in the state, of whom only 18 are contesting again. Vinod Tawde from Borivali and Chandrashekhar Bawankule from Kamtee constituency did not get tickets this year. Another five — four from the ruling Shiv Sena and another from BJP’s minor ally — are members of the legislative council. Also, Chandrakant Patil, who is contesting from Kothrud this time, was an red movable assets worth Rs 98.3 lakh and immovable assets worth Rs 28.4 crore this year. His movable assets were worth Rs 9.1 lakh in 2014 and immovable assets were Rs 2.2 crore. He has shown his source of income as farming, rent and honorarium. Munde has declared assets owned by her and her spouse (see box). Her source of income is farming and honorarium and her husband’s source of income is business and farming.

Maharashtra assembly elections: Parties try to get rebels’ withdrawal | Kolhapur News - Times of India,"KOLHAPUR: To ensure victories for their assembly election candidates, the political parties are trying to get the rebel prospects to withdraw their nominations by Monday. The rebel issue has affected all major parties including BJP, Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena. All the parties have requested the rebels to withdraw their nominations by Monday noon to avoid division of votes. There are 10 assembly segments in the Kolhapur district. The highest number of rebels — who have filed their nominations — belong to BJP, followed by Congress, NCP and then Shiv Sena. The prominent rebels include Samarjitsinh Ghatage of BJP, who is contesting from the Kagal seat; NCP’s Rajendra Patil Yadravkar(Shirol), Shiv Sena’s Prabhakar Khadekar (Chandgad) and Arun Dongle of Congress (Radhanagari). The BJP rebels have filed nomination papers from five assembly seats in the district. As per the seat-sharing formula between Sena and BJP, the former is contesting from eight seats and the latter from two seats. BJP had earlier identified candidates and was all set to contest from all seats in the district. However, after the alliance, the party is contesting from only two seats. The situation has created tension as some leaders are refusing to back out of the elections. Even after the alliance, BJP tried to stake claim over Kagal and Chandgad seats. However, Sena refused. BJP had earlier projected Samarjitsinh Ghatge as its candidate from Kagal constituency. However, after being denied the seat by Sena, Ghatge filed his nomination as an independent candidate. Ghatge’s filing of nomination as an independent created challenges for Sanjay Ghatge, the Shiv Sena’s official candidate from Kagal. Similarly, the Congress-NCP alliance has allotted the Shirol seat to Swabhimani Paksha’s Anil Madnaik, who filed his nomination on Thursday. NCP’s Yadravkar, who is determined to contest from Shirol, has rebelled and has filed his nomination. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra assembly polls: Stark contrasts at Wadgaon Sheri assembly constituency | Pune News - Times of India,"The electoral race for the Wadgaon Sheri assembly constituency is as diverse as the segment itself — it includes a paan stall owner, an autorickshaw driver and some of the richest candidates in the region. A similar contrast emerges if one were to study the many localities that make up this constituency. On one side are the posh neighbourhoods of Kalyaninagar, Vimannagar and Koregaon Park. And then we have fast growing suburbs like Lohegaon, where residents have resorted to even managing traffic by themselves. “We leave early from our offices to stand at traffic signals in Lohegaon. It took us months of campaigns to get a signal installed at a junction here. Even for the most basic services, we are made to do the rounds of the civic offices,” said a resident. He added: “Just a few kilometres from us are areas without water problems or power cuts. Lohegaon seems like a place in a different country when compared to Koregaon Park.” Wadgaon Sheri has had a water shortage for years. “We have been fighting for water for the past 25 years,” said Suhas Bhingare, who lives in Sainikwadi. “The supply is poor, insufficient and erratic. Many political leaders have been elected; they made promises and left. But problems remain the same. There is no change.” The water shortage has impacted several other up and coming neighbourhoods within the constituency — Mundhwa, Kharadi and Dhanori. All three are experiencing rapid urbanisation. All three are today completely dependent on water tankers run by the PMC or private operators. Officials here often blame a population boom for the shortage in services. In 2009–10, Lohegaon, located near the airport, had a population of just about 2,500 families. A decade on, that number has risen to 90,000 families. “But where else are we supposed to go? We can’t afford to buy homes in Koregaon Park or Vimannagar. So Lohegaon is the only option. However, we don’t seem to have the same quality of services,” said Prateek Singh, a resident. The list of problems is almost endless. There are no streetlights in some areas; no CCTV networks either. Vital arterial roads fill with slush every monsoon and traffic congestion is widespread. The lack of civic maintenance has impacted a large percentage of the local population that needs to commute daily for work. “The most acute problem in Lohegaon is daily commute. Those living near the Porwal Road area, Sathe vasti and other parts have no alternative routes. We are forced to use a 40-foot wide private road (Porwal road) which is shared by more than 70, 000 families ,” said Rakesh Ojha, a member of the Lohegaon Residents Welfare Association (LRWA). Working women here are particularly impacted. “I had to settle for a work-from-home option. The road I take home during the evenings has no streetlights. There’s no guarantee I will get back safe,” said Sulochana Pandey, who works with a tech firm in Yerawada. Nearly six kilometres from Lohegaon is Kharadi, home to one of the biggest IT parks in Pune city. “Kharadi has big business hubs. Some of the largest software companies in this part of the world have come to settle here. But our roads don’t reflect the economic progress,” said Resham Gandhi, a resident of Gulmohar housing society. “Every monsoon, we’re back to dodging potholes. Several roads are downright unsafe for motorists and pedestrians. And our pleas to corporators and MLAs have been ignored.” KEY PROBLEMSA water scarcity in many parts. Lohegaon, Kharadi and parts of Vimannagar suffer acute shortages during the summer BAD ROADSSeveral roads have been stuck in administrative limbo. Porwal Road is an example. There are five multispecialty hospitals near this road. But an ambulance will find it difficult to cross this stretch during peak hours SAFETYAll of Lohegaon doesn’t have a fire station.

"Why Devendra Fadnavis report card not made public, asks ex-CM Prithviraj Chavan | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Monday said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had not broken his silence on his fiveyear performance and the key issues before the state even when the assembly election was just a week away. “Campaigning for the assembly election has entered the last phase, but still Fadnavis has not outlined his development plan for Maharashtra, nor is he able to explain to the people the achievements of his government in the past five years. Not only Fadnavis, but even Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are concentrating on Article 370. Instead of addressing core issues, they are diverting the attention of people,” Chavan said. Chavan said Fadnavis’s biggest failure was his inability to bring home even a single new project in the infrastructure sector in the past five years. “Our foreign direct and domestic investment is on the decline compared to Congress-NCP rule. In the past five years, no new project has been set up in the state,” he said. He said that leading independent financial institutions had found the national economy was on the brink and the head of the International Monetary Fund had expressed shock over the deteriorating financial condition, even predicting a higher growth rate for Nepal and Bangladesh.

Mob lynchings in the country have increased under BJP rule: Asaduddin Owaisi | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi said on Sunday that incidents of mob lynching and hatred for Muslims have increased under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime in the country. Owaisi was speaking at a rally organised to campaign for three party candidates — Daniel Landge, Heena Momin and Zahid Shaikh, who are contesting from the Wadgaon Sheri, Pune Cantonment and Hadapsar assembly constituencies respectively. The AIMIM has fielded 48 candidates for the state assembly elections. “Ever since the BJP came to power, attacks on Muslims have increased across the country. One needs to answer why so many innocent people like software professional Mohsin Shaikh have been victims of lynching. The killers are confident of getting away scotfree,” he said. The four-time MP demanded that Muslims in the state must get reservations like the Marathas. “Muslims are poor and are divided into 50 subcastes. On the other hand, Marathas have everything today. Why can’t we get reservations?” Owaisi also targeted the Congress, saying Rahul Gandhi had abandoned the ship after facing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections this year. “The party is not in a position to rejuvenate itself. The AIMIM will become a strong opposition party in Maharashtra,” he said. Owaisi said the party is not confined to Muslims alone in Maharashtra. “We have given tickets to leaders of all communities. Our party belongs to all communities,” he added. MIM may gain from division of votesAURANGABAD: BJP and Sena candidates have locked horns in all the three constituencies in Aurangabad city.

BJP turncoat in Nashik starts campaign with ‘what was my fault’ bulk messages | Nashik News - Times of India,"NASHIK: BJP rebel Balasaheb Sanap, who quit the BJP and filed his nomination on an NCP ticket from Nashik East constituency, has started his campaign with an emotional question to voters: “What is my fault?” He has started sending this question as bulk cellphone messages to the electorate voters. Sanap, who is the sitting MLA from the constituency, was denied a ticket by BJP. The party instead favoured Rahul Dhikle, who quit MNS a few hours before the deadline of nomination filing on Friday. Soon after, Sanap received the AB form from NCP and filed his nomination on NCP’s ticket. An interesting contest is now brewing in the constituency, with the opposition parties set to join forces against the BJP. Sources said the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena was likely to leave the Nashik East seat to Sanap, on the condition that Congress supports MNS candidates in the city. A decision in this regard is likely to be reached by Monday morning. “Senior leaders from NCP and MNS are holding discussions. A decision is expected shortly,” an MNS source said. Sharad Aher, the Congress’ Nashik unit president, urged the MNS to withdraw from Nashik East and also Central. “In Kothrud, both NCP and Congress have not fielded candidates (and will suport MNS candidate Kishor Shinde). Similarly, MNS should now withdraw from Nashik Central (where Congress candidate Hemlata Patil is in the fray) and Nashik East (where Sanap is contesting),” Aher said. “Balasaheb Sanap has brought government funds worth at least Rs 400 crore for the construction of an auditorium and other works in the constituency during his five-year stint as a BJP MLA. Since BJP refused to field him, Sanap got an NCP ticket. The BJP will find the going tough now,” said political observers. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra polls: 74 land in trouble over spending | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Non-submission of election expenditure has placed 74 candidates from the 246 contesting in Pune district under the scanner. As many as 45 candidates have been issued notices for remaining absent for the checking of accounts while 29 others got notices for understatement of expenditure details in the first round of scrutiny, nodal officer Ajit Relekar said. Every candidate is allowed up to Rs 28 lakh as poll expenditure. All candidates must submit the incurred expenditure. If they do not respond to the notices in a time frame, they can be barred from contesting elections for three years. “Candidates can submit their say at a hearing or give the final expenditure within 30 days,’’ Relekar said. Candidates must have a separate account and file the election expenses with the ECI. All registered political parties have to submit a statement of their expenditure to the ECI within 90 days of the completion of the elections. An incorrect account of expenditure, beyond the cap, can lead to disqualification up to three years under section 10A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Candidates have to submit the accounts within 20 days of receipt of the notice. The reply of the candidate and the comment of the respective DEO is considered by the Election Commission of India for a final decision. If the ECI is not satisfied, then under section 10 (A), the order is issued against the candidate, debarring him/ her from fighting an election for three years which is published in the gazette. Poll observers maintain that candidates spend much more than the Rs 28 lakh. They adjust their expenditure under party expenses as there is no cap. “They are supposed to submit the details as per the rate chart drawn up by the election department. If they give an understatement they can be put under scrutiny,’’ election officials said. A candidate said they are short of time and had to send a representative with the expenditure details and was issued a show-cause notice. “We have just a week left and did not have enough time to submit the details. We will be doing so shortly,’’ another candidate said.

Maharashtra assembly polls: Voters want a leadership with strong networks | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The Pune Cantonment assembly will need an MLA who will be able to set up better communication lines with multiple defence agencies. The constituency will not see any new civic projects, unless the next representative is able to work with defence authorities better, residents and activists living in the area said. But an improved network between Centre and constituency has always been a challenge for MLAs from the constituency. As a result, decisions on several key issues such as FSI restrictions and an overhauled drainage network have been stuck in paperwork or policy hell for years. “To resolve this conundrum, the local representatives must forge a bond not only with the Local Military Authority, but also with the Ministry of Defence. This is not possible unless they understand how the ministry works,” said lawyeractivist Netraprakash Bhog. Another activist from the area said: “Barring the Lullanagar flyover, the Cantonment has not any new civic project in the past five years. Solutions to major problems that impact people’s lives are still pending. If people cannot repair their homes because of restrictions imposed by defence authorities, how can the Cantonment say it is focused on development? Many were left with no choice, but move to other locations in the city. So far, our representatives have not been able to reverse this migration.” Pune Cantonment is also troubled by traffic congestion and bad roads. “Residents of eastern parts of Pune city have to pass through Cantonment areas. But many roads have potholes. Most are narrow and do not have the require carriageway width. What has the MLA done to ease traffic congestion in the area?” asked Kevin Manvel, a resident. A proposal to change water pipelines has been pending for years. Residents said there have been many instances of contaminants entering water lines due to corroded pipes. The construction of a railway overbridge at Ghorpadi is key to reducing congestion at the crossing, which affects working professionals from Kondhwa and Wanowrie. “But this project has been stuck for a decade. Despite opening closed roads, we cannot access the Elliot Lines road. Our politicians never pushed for the overbridge,” said Sandeep Shinde, a resident of Pune Cantonment.

Include climate change in party manifestos: Clean Air Collective | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Creating vehiclefree zones, enforcing bus lanes and mass transport systems, introducing electric vehicles, and imposing disincentives to discourage use of private cars, besides making 100% compliance mandatory for industrial emissions and construction sites should be part of political manifestos, demanded Clean Air Collective, a joint group of NGOs working in the interest of environment, as part of its representations to the BJP, Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP. The joint forum had actually made these recommendations for the Clean Air Plan being readied by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) for Mumbai, as according to it, keeping the air cleaner can only help the world avoid the adverse impacts of global warming phenomenon that is affecting agriculture, forests and human health. Conservation Action Trust, Waatavaran, Centre for Science & Environment, Urban Emi -ssions, Urban Sciences, Council on Energy, Environment & Water, Parisar, Centre for Sustainable Development, Let India Breathe, Yuva, Purpose, Aamchi Mumbai Aamchi Best, Santosh Harish – Centre for Policy Research are part of the forum. Activist Bhagwan Kesbhat said lack of clear and target-oriented environment policy by political parties and the poor will in taking steps to strengthen quality of air, water and soil are costing the country badly compared to other countries. Pointing out that 18 cities in Maharashtra, including Mumbai, are highly polluted, Kesbhat said the forum wants parties to come up with their own action plans. He added that forum had already approached senior politicians including Prithviraj Chavan, Madhav Bhandari and Vandana Chavan with its recommendations. Environmentalist Debi Goenka said it came as a shock for him when the readings for air pollution in the city taken by the US Embassy were far more than the MPCB readings. According to Clean Air Collective leaders, roundthe-clock pollution data monitoring with minimum 68 air monitoring stations across Mumbai can only give the actual picture. The forum also wants quick response teams to be in place to tackle pollution threats. Activists Ruhie Kumar, Nikhil Kalmegh and Riddhima Pandey said curbing pollution from vehicles and factories is the need of the hour given the rising temperatures due to polluted air.

"Maharashtra elections: Under scanner, angadias shut shop in poll season | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: An unwritten code of silence surrounds the angadia couriers of Bhuleshwar each time an election comes around. These Gujarati-led establishments close shop for as long as the code of conduct is in place. Some are instructed to do so by the authorities; others do so of their own volition “to avoid harassment”. Angadias, who mostly operate from the Kalbadevi-Girgaum belt, transfer cash or jewellery primarily between Mumbai and Gujarat on a daily basis aboard Gujarat Mail, aka Angadia Mail. But the authorities suspect that these businessmen are involved in hawala operations and carry money used to influence voters. Confiscation, seizure and detention of men, material and money are common during election season. Angadias have come under the scanner this poll season too. The election commission has declared the Bhuleshwar -Zaveri bazaar area, teeming with gold and diamond jewellers, as expenditureb sensitive due to the high incidence of cash transactions there. “When an area is declared as expenditure-sensitive, vigilance is increased. In this case, there is a whole underground economy that poses a challenge,” said district election officer Shivaji Jondhale. In fact, a special expenditure observer for the state has been appointed. Explaining the dependency on angadias, a Zaveri Bazaar jeweller said, “It is an easy and cost-effective way to deliver cash. An Angadia charges Rs 100 as commission for a transaction of Rs 1 lakh. Besides, they offer credit too if the customer is wellknown and has tremendous good will.” Added to poll season scrutiny is the scanner of GST authorities. “Still, some manage to do business out of odd places like godowns or kitchens. Commission rates too increase because of the higher risk,” said an operator. During the Lok Sabha polls, Rs 18 crore in unaccounted cash was seized in the island city. After not being found related to election expenditure, it was cleared by a committee and returned to the owners. TOI spoke to four angadia operators in Bhuleshwar, none of whom was willing to come on record. Each confirmed that no action is taken after an initial seizure. “Of course, business suffers during polls, particularly when they coincide with peak festival season. We are not hawala operators, but couriers. We issue bills. I, for one, have not closed shop and will not do so either. How will we feed our families if we close for 15 days each time an election comes by?” said the partner of a leading angadia firm in Bhuleshwar. “Say polling is countermanded and re-election held, should we close all over again?” On October 2, a raid was conducted on Gujarat Mail at Borivli station on more than 20 couriers from 13 angadia firms from Surat and Mumbai.

"Maharashtra elections: People suffering, Modi promising the moon, says Rahul Gandhi | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched a broadside against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president and home minister Amit Shah on Sunday, saying that under their leadership the economy has collapsed, unemployment has reached its peak, and farmers' suicides have seen a spurt. Addressing poll rallies at Dharavi and Chandivli, he also mentioned the PMC Bank scam, saying that Modi and Shah have maintained silence on it, and that the two are making all possible efforts to divert people's attention from core issues by focusing on matters like Article 370, and talking of the moon and rocket science. This was Gandhi's first public appearance in Maharashtra after Congress' humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, following which he stepped down from the post of party president.  During his Sunday speeches, Gandhi compared the BJP government with the British regime, which, he alleged, plundered the people of India. His first rally was in Ausa in Latur, followed by two rallies in Mumbai-in Chandivli, a Gujarati-dominated constituency from where Varsha Gaikwad is Congress's nominee, and in Dharavi, which primarily comprises Dalits and Muslims and where the Congress candidate is the old-timer Naseem Khan. The Ausa rally was significant since CM Devendra Fadnavis's former PA Abhimanyu Pawar is BJP's nominee there.  ""Modi does not speak on unemployment, closure of factories, and farmers' suicides, but prefers to talk on Article 370, the moon and rocket science. Modi and Shah are diverting people's attention from core issues. They will not succeed in their tactics to mislead the people. People will dislodge the government,"" Gandhi said.  Taking up the 4,355-crore PMC Bank scam, he said Fadnavis and his party seniors have maintained ""discreet silence"" over it. ""Thousands of account holders are suffering. They may not get back their deposits. We are keen to know what steps the CM has taken on the issue,"" Gandhi said. He also questioned the purpose of defence minister Rajnath Singh's ""unprecedented"" visit to France to receive the first Rafale fighter jet, saying BJP leaders are bearing ""guilt in their minds for making mistakes in the controversial deal"".

Maharashtra elections: Muslim workers from BJP demand 5 seats | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: A group of Muslim workers of BJP demanded at least five seats for members of the community. BJP city vice-president Hyder Azam said, ""If the party gave some seats to Muslims, it would only help us in convincing the community to vote for the party on the sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas agenda."" Azam is seeking a ticket from Malad. He has been in the party for over two decades. In 2014, BJP gave only one ticket to a Muslim - Pasha Patel from Ausa, who lost. This time at least five Muslims have expressed desire to contest on BJP tickets. Rida Rashid, who wants to contest from Mumbra, said if Muslims from the community pockets are elected on BJP tickets they would be able to address the issues of the community easily and strengthen the bonds between BJP and the community.

"Maharashtra elections: Parties spin Dharavi redevelopment plan yet again, but residents not buying | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: For the residents of Dharavi, who are used to tourists walking into the congested lanes and their cramped homes, elections are incidental events. Proposed two decades ago, the redevelopment of Dharavi, which has one of the most dense living spaces in Mumbai and was once touted to be the largest slum in Asia, still remains on paper. According to the Rs 6,400-crore redevelopment project proposed by the Congress-NCP government in 2004, all residents would get 225 sq ft houses. Fifteen years later, the BJP-Shiv Sena government announced 350 sq ft houses for the affected residents, escalating the project cost to Rs 30,000 crore. But nothing has changed on the ground. “Both the Congress-NCP and BJP-Sena governments have lacked the political will to implement the Dharavi redevelopment plan. All these parties are culprits,” says Raju Korde of the Dharavi redevelopment committee, which coordinates with the government and the residents. The redevelopment project is currently entangled in a legal dispute after the government delayed awarding the work order to the contractor. Dharavi has always been a Congress fiefdom. The party has only lost two assembly elections from this constituency—in 1978, CPM had won and in 1995, Shiv Sena. Assuring residents that they would not be forced to leave Dharavi for the redevelopment project was one of the main planks of the assembly election campaigns of three-time Congress MLA Varsha Gaikwad, who had been nominated from the constituency after her father Eknath Gaikwad contested the Lok Sabha polls in 2004. “I have been pushing the project with the government consistently. I am always available for the public,” Gaikwad says. But locals are not convinced. “We are worried that our businesses might been being shifted out of Dharavi during redevelopment,” says Imitaaz Shaikh, a scrap dealer. “We have been asking the government for clarity on the issue to no avail.” Originally a fishing village, slums started mushrooming in Dharavi when industries were shifted here during the plague epidemic in the late 19th century. Dharavi is home for several small-scale industries, including earthenware, waste recycling and a leather industry, and the traders are not happy with the proposed shifting of their businesses under the redevelopment plan. They complain that the government policies and economic slowdown has impacting their businesses. “The government’s decision to ban slaughter of bulls and bullocks has hit our business. And after demonetisation and GST, our losses have increased,” says Sarfarz Khan, member of the leather association. Another local, Sreeji Aaiyapaa, suggests: “It is important that the government consider the economic and social culture of Dharavi while planning the redevelopment project.” This assembly election may not be a cakewalk for Gaikwad. Political analysts point out that in the 2014 polls, BJP and Sena had contested seperately, which had benefitted Gaikwad, and this time, the AIMIM too has put up a candidate. “There is a huge anti-incumbency for Gaikwad. People are tired of dynasty politics and lack of development,” says a Sena leader. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Aurangabad: BSP leader assaulted for denying ticket to aspirant | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: Denying a ticket to an aspirant proved costly to a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader as the latter was and his driver were assaulted by the former and his supporters in Mukundwadi area of the city on Thursday. According to police, the suspect, district president of BSP Ganesh Nikalje, and his supporters have been booked for unlawful assembly, rioting and voluntarily causing hurt. The injured have been identified as Namdev Tukaram Khandare (54) of Loha tehsil in Nanded and his driver Balaji Uttam Waghmare (35). The duo has been admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital after the assault. Police have also filed a cross complaint of using criminal force to outrage a woman’s modesty against Khandare. After preliminary probe, a police officer said informed that Khandare was appointed observer for state assembly elections by BSP. “He had gone to Mumbai to meet party leaders and finalise the list of candidates. On his way back to Nanded, Khandare took a halt in a Mukundwadi area-based hotel on Wednesday. The next morning, Nikalje with around a dozen of supporters barged in to the hotel and asked the reason as to why he was denied ticket,” the officer said.

"Shiv Sena assures free education for poor girls, upgrade of 50,000km of rural roads | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: While Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya promised that Aarey will be declared a forest if they come to power, the issue was not included in the party’s main election manifesto that was released on Saturday. It is included in the region-specific section of the manifesto for Mumbai. “The Aarey issue has been included in the Mumbai manifesto, in which we have mentioned that it will be declared a forest. We will release smaller manifestos for every region, including Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Marathwada, etc, soon” Aaditya said, adding that other regional manifestos will be circulated soon. Though the Shiv Sena is in an alliance with the BJP, it announced a separate party manifesto on Saturday. The other key promises the Sena has made include free college education for girls from economically weaker sections, upgrade of 50,000km of rural roads into allweather stretches, medical tests at Re 1 and scholarships to 15 lakh graduates. While unveiling the manifesto, party chief Uddhav Thackeray said all financial aspects, including the expected burden on the exchequer, had been considered before the document was finalised. “The Shiv Sena always fulfils its promises as the party makes only those which it can fulfil,” he said. Uddhav said questions could be raised over subsidised meals, medical tests and relief offered on power tariff, “so we have tried to balance it out without burdening the state exchequer”. Prodded on the nutritious meal plan, which is similar to the Zunka Bhakar Scheme announced and implemented by the Sena-BJP government in 1995 and later scrapped, Uddhav said, “Let us come to power. Whatever I have promised will be fulfilled.” On constructing durable roads through the Mukhyamantri Shahar Sadak Yojna, Aaditya said, “Village panchayats and municipal bodies face challenges over expenses on roads due to GST. Hence, 50,000km of roads connecting villages to cities will be developed as all-weather roads. And provision will be made in the state budget for those local bodies through the Mukhyamantri Shahar Sadak Yojna on the lines of Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojna.” In its 2017 BMC election manifesto, the Sena had mentioned that Aarey would be marked as a green zone in the civic body’s Development Plan. Uddhav reiterated that the Sena was against building a car shed at Aarey. Saying one should refrain from blaming his party as the Aarey issue concerned everyone, he added all parties should come together, discuss it and make their stand clear. “Shiv Sena is against the car shed (at Aarey) and will oppose it in future,” Uddhav maintained. The Metro authorities have defended felling of trees saying it is restricted to a small area and is necessary to ensure a modern transport system for Mumbaikars. The proposed car shed for the Metro-III line would occupy 33 hectares. Targeting Sharad Pawar-led NCP for the mention of bhoomiputra (son of soil) in its manifesto, Uddhav said, “They have nothing left to promise, so they have come to the son-of-soil issue. The Sena was termed narrow-minded and communal when it raised the issue 50 years ago.” Taking on MNS chief and cousin Raj Thackeray, who has asked voters to vote for a strong opposition, Uddhav said, “The next time they may contest polls just to read the newspapers.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra assembly elections: Snub to four netas a message to all in BJP? | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: By denying party nominations to Vinod Tawde, Eknath Khadse, Prakash Mehta and Raj Purohit for the assembly elections, the BJP has brought the curtain down on the Pramod Mahajan-Gopinath Munde era which saw the rise of the quartet in the 1990s, said political analysts. Tawde and Khadse came into their own in 1995 when the BJP teamed up with the Shiv Sena to form the saffron government in the state. Ditto with Mehta and Purohit. Mehta was inducted in the Manohar Joshi regime to win over the Gujarati community. Kirit Somaiya too played a key role in consolidating the BJP’s base among the city’s traders, said a party worker from Mulund. Somaiya was denied the Lok Sabha nomination from Mumbai North-East earlier this year. When the Sena-BJP lost the 1999 state elections, Khadse and Tawde joined Munde to do some brilliant sabre-rattling on the floor of the state legislature and keep the ruling Congress-NCP combine on a tight leash, said Vidhan Bhavan observers. “The BJP bigwigs have, in one fell swoop, cut to size an entire team of functionaries who helped the party strike deep roots in Mumbai in the 1990s,” said a former party MLA. Eknath Khadse, he added, has for long been the BJP’s poster boy in northern Maharashtra. The CM is said to be deeply embarrassed by the turn of events as he, sources close to him said, tried to persuade the BJP central Parliamentary board to take a lenient stand on the issue, but apparently to no avail. Tawde’s aggressive style of functioning and Mehta’s alleged role in the allotment of a Tardeo slum project, which kicked up an unsavoury row, have cost them their seats, it is learnt. The party has turned the quartet into an example to be held up before legislators to keep them under control, sources said. The BJP high command on Friday released the fourth -- and final -- list of Maharashtra poll candidates without the names of the four party seniors. In keeping with the protocol, Tawde, being a cabinet minister, should have made it to the very first list, sources added. “Tawde is a hard nut to crack. He has a mind of his own and wouldn’t let anyone get into his hair. His aggressive style of functioning didn’t go down well with the party bosses in New Delhi,” said a state BJP functionary. Fadnavis had deputed a senior BJP minister to make Tawde see reason even as the party high command kept close tabs on the latter’s functioning, he said, adding, “But Tawde made light of the senior minister’s warning.” A section in the city BJP thinks that the party high command has been unduly harsh on the foursome. “We are told that Mehta has been denied a ticket because of several irregularities in the Tardeo slum project. But look at the track record of many of the defectors who have joined the BJP. Most of them face cases of corruption, and they want immunity from the law and a seat in the state assembly as well,” said a former party MLA.

The Nagpur-based Pande is credited with dislodging the Vasundhara Raje government of the BJP in Rajasthan. ""A high-level team of Congress activists worked round-the-clock in Rajasthan,"" Pande said. ""We were able to convince the people of Rajasthan that it was high time for the dismissal of the BJP-led government. Our strategy worked out successfully, we wrested power from the BJP. For Maharashtra, we have drafted a separate plan. We have less than a fortnight but we are confident the Congress-NCP will wrest power from the saffron combine."" He said the party would convince the people through the war room volunteers that the BJP-led government of CM Devendra Fadnavis had failed to contain inflation, unemployment, the agrarian crisis and farmer suicides. Pande said senior politicians led by Rahul Gandhi and politicians from Congress-ruled Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh, and from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP and New Delhi will join the campaign. ""We expect CMs of most of the Congress-ruled states as well as prominent leaders of other states to join in to dislodge the Fadnavis government. We have appointed at least two observers, one from the state and one from outside, for each assembly constituency,"" he said. MP politician Jyotiraditya Scindia will address more than a dozen election rallies, mostly in Vidarbha, Marathwada and Mumbai region, on October 16, 17 and 18. Scindia was the head of the screening committee of the MPCC. Pande said the war room was being managed by over 350 highly educated Congress activists. ""War room activists will coordinate the campaign in all the constituencies allotted to the Congress. They will be involved in booth level management, effective use of information technology. They will interact with party observers for each constituency, monitor cases of violation of code of conduct by rivals, coordinate with state chief electoral officer and the EC, and take care of coordination of VVIP and VIP visits across the state,"" Pande said.

Mumbai MLA Sardar Tara Singh, who is in his 80s, and speaker Haribhau Bagade, who is 75, may thus find it difficult to get a ticket. Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters in Mumbai, Patil said those facing allegations of corruption, such as MLAs Prakash Mehta and Eknath Khadse, will be investigated and accordingly the party will decide whether to allow them to contest or not. Meanwhile, Patil also said an alliance with the Shiv Sena is certain and that seat distribution will be announced soon. At the conference, the party released a list of its nine resolutions for the state and Mumbai. For the state, the party has promised to make all of Maharashtra drought-free by creating a water grid for Marathwada where excess water from other areas will be diverted. “Just the other day Pune flooded while there are areas where we provide water through tankers.” The BJP government, he said, had constructed seven lakh homes and another three lakh are being constructed. “A minimum 300-square-foot house, healthcare for all and piped drinking water are the other resolutions,” he said. For Mumbai, the party is showcasing the metro network as its biggest achievement while ensuring a safe city with ease-of-doing business. After ‘Chai pe Charcha’ to connect with the common man, this election the party will hold ‘Coffee with Leader’ to connect with the youth. “After all, conversations now happen at CCD (Cafe Coffee Day),” said BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay. On the Sharad Pawar-enforcement directorate controversy, Patil said it was the Congress gover nment under CM Prithviraj Chavan that had complained to Reserve Bank of India about corruption in the apex cooperative bank. “Congress government had initiated an inquiry and we have only provided information to the high court that has directed an FIR be filed,” he said, adding he prayed for harmony in Pawar family.

BJP’s Kisan Kathore was the first to file nomination papers for the Speaker’s post on Saturday. In the evening, Walse Patil, state Congress president Balasaheb Thorat and Shiv Sena’s legislature party leader Eknath Shinde had a brief interaction with BJP leaders, saying that keeping with tradition, it would be better if Kathore withdrew so that Patole could be elected unopposed. BJP didn’t take a decision immediately. Later, during a meeting convened by Walse Patil in his chamber, in the presence of Devendra Fadnavis, Thorat, and Shinde, when it was pointed out that BJP didn’t have the numbers and it would be better if a contest was avoided, Kathore withdrew his nomination papers, following which Patole was elected as Speaker unopposed. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said BJP had no option as Kathore would have been defeated on the floor of the house. He said another reason for BJP to withdraw was the possibility of open voting. Patole was a Lok Sabha member from BJP, but after criticising the Centre on its handling of the agrarian crisis, he quit his party in 2017. In January 2018 he joined Congress.

Shiv Sena aims to make farmers debt-free: Uddhav Thackeray | Nagpur News - Times of India,"AMRAVATI: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said the saffron alliance would return to power to shape destiny of Maharashtra. Thackeray said he would strive to provide six gas cylinders free of cost to those who are extremely poor, food at Rs10 to rural people and primary health check in just Re1 for the poor. The party manifesto, which will be released on Saturday, aims at making farmers loan free rather than giving them loan waiver, he said. Uddhav, who was addressing an election rally at the Dussehra maidan here for Shiv Sena candidates Preeti Band (Badnera), Sunita Fiske (Achalpur), Rajesh Wankhade (Teosa) and BJP candidate Dr Sunil Deshmukh (Amravati), praised the crop insurance scheme and LPG cylinder scheme of the Centre and said that if the BJP- Shiv Sena retained power, he would ensure grant for farmers who want to erect fence at their farm to protect their crop from wild animals. “You can imagine the predicament of a batsman who has to score more in less number of balls. I am in no such tension. My score is decided and the target has been fixed. I have already won the match,” he said about the outcome of the assembly polls. Thackeray said that he was confident of the victory of all saffron alliance candidates in Amravati district. On the defeat of party’s Amravati candidate Anand Adsul in Lok Sabha election this year, he urged the gathering to ensure this is not repeated. “Grass roots workers of the party represent the constituency. They cannot be bought by money. Fiske and Band are grass roots activists who are capable of dethroning moneyed independents. They can redress people’s grievances,” Thackeray said. He warned that any betrayal would not be tolerated.

"Maharashtra elections: Colaba waits for better water supply, redevelopment of old buildings | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: It is the seat of power - Mantralaya, Assembly, high court, BMC headquarters - and the beating heart of India's financial capital, hosting the Reserve Bank of India, a mint, headquarters of several banks and LIC, and the Bombay Stock Exchange. It is home to the city's two Unesco world heritage sites - the CSTM terminus, and the Victorian Gothic and Art Deco ensembles around Oval Maidan - and has several, well-maintained open spaces, wide roads and footpaths. Colaba, the glam constituency, is also the one that faced the brunt 26/11 attacks and several other terrorist blasts. The constituency refuses to be bracketed, with its incredible mix - from posh Cuffe Parade towers to Macchimar Nagar, the Colaba townhouses to Sasoon Dock, the ordered Navy Nagar to the teeming Crawford Market. With several major markets, it is a hub of traders and they are, more often than not, bang on their money on which way the wind is blowing. Viren Shah, president, Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association and owner of Roopam store at Crawford Market, said despite the economic slowdown, the trader community is fully with BJP. ""The slowdown is global and notwithstanding the pain of demonetisation, the vote is for Modi,"" he said. The party, however, decided not to re-nominate its senior leader and five-term MLA Raj Purohit, and instead gave the ticket to Rahul Narvekar, who joined BJP after being nominated. ""I resigned as Member of the Legislative Council only a week prior to the announcement of my candidacy,"" said Narvekar.  Narvekar has moved from Shiv Sena to NCP, and now BJP. His father has been a corporator from Colaba for 30 years. His brother Makarand and sister-in-law are councillors from two wards in Colaba. ""While I have moved across parties, I have always been inclined to the rightist ideology, and so my joining BJP is not opportunistic,"" he said. Since his family has been working in the civic sphere for several decades, Narvekar says he has a people connect and that is decidedly an advantage. ""Congress candidate Ashok Jagtap does not stay here. He is from Bandra and is definitely no match,"" he said. Jagtap visibly bristles at the charge. ""I have been an MLA from Khetwadi even when I was a resident of Bandra. Mumbai is spread over 40 sq km so it really does not matter where one resides,"" he said. Jagtap identified his priorities as ensuring the water supply problem is permanently resolved and that the land of the fisherfolk is properly demarcated. ""Traffic congestion is another problem I plan to resolve,"" he said. Damodar Tandel, president of the Akhil Maharashtra Machchimar Kruti Samiti and resident of the Colaba Machchimar Nagar, said despite a 2011 Government Resolution, the state is yet to transfer ownership of the land on which they live in their names. Talking about 26/11, he said it is the fisherfolk who are now viewed with suspicion. ""For the past five years, every time a boat goes out to sea, the khalasis (helpers on the boat) have to queue up for a coupon which has to be turned in on return to land. There are long queues. It has made life difficult for us,"" he said. Sabrina Fernandes, who lives near the Colaba post office, said traffic congestion, mangrove destruction and spread of slums are major issues in the area. ""He (Makarand Narvekar) is quite popular and that should benefit Rahul,"" she said. For Narvekar, water shortage and redevelopment of old and dilapidated buildings are priorities.

Manifesto: Make-or-break moment for Mumbai | Mumbai News - Times of India,"TOI’s call for a Manifesto for Mumbai to echo the city’s aspirations and concerns in the run-up to the assembly election has received an overwhelming response from concerned citizens and people’s forums. The suggestions have been collated into a public charter on behalf of the city’s thinking minds for politicians to take note and, importantly, act on. Here’s a peek into the city’s expectations from the next government Affordable HousingIn Mumbai, the city of dreams, a very middleclass longing of owning a home largely remains unfulfilled. Given the current slump in the property market, the government should ideally give a boost to affordable housing schemes. While builders brush off any criticism citing low demand, whenever Mhada announces a lottery for affordable housing, it receives an unprecedented number of applications, going on to prove that even in times of recession, there is a huge demand for affordable housing. Industry experts have repeatedly said the government needs to take several policy steps to overcome challenges in such housing schemes. Developers who need to be stakeholders say the high cost of land is a major reason why projects in Mumbai are expensive; also, a slow pace of granting permissions results in cost overruns. Thus, the government should take corrective steps to ensure that projects undertaken under affordable housing schemes are financially viable for developers so that they can pass on the benefits to buyers. Given that among end-users, demand is in the affordable segment where builders get tax exemption and buyers get a credit-linked subsidy, the thrust should be towards strengthening such a trend. Education and HealthWith private schooling getting expensive, there is an urgent need to revamp civic and aided education. There is also a need for better implementation of the Right to Education Act as several thousand seats remain vacant each year across schools in the state and parents continue to pay for private schools. A recent ranking on quality of education in the country put Maharashtra at the sixth position, with a poor score for infrastructure and equity or inclusion. There is also a need for better quality and variety in midday meals across government and aided schools. At the same time, a white paper by the NGO, Praja Foundation, states that a Mumbai household’s annual average spend on health increased by 45% to Rs 98,214 in 2017-18, from Rs 67,875 in 2016-17. The study essentially underlined that Mumbaikars are consequently spending a higher percentage of their income on health, despite the BMC, one of the country’s richest municipal corporations, allocating over Rs 3,600 crore for healthcare. One of the obvious solutions could be the strengthening of primary health infrastructure by recruiting more doctors and making basic medicines available, which will also help tackle overcrowding and ensure quality care at tertiary hospitals. Integrated Transport SystemThe state government plans to integrate all parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region through the Metro rail system so that even the farthest point-topoint travel can be accomplished in under an hour. The CM recently said that the aim of Mumbai Metro is to be able to ferry one crore commuters by 2024, making it the largest such system in the country. He also spoke of a common mobility card for buses, local trains, Monorail and the Metro. But transport experts say that this grand ambition cannot be achieved unless there is a unified transport body to monitor all the agencies involved. A unified transport body can also deal with issues such as revenue sharing and other aspects of inter-agency co-ordination. Another point of concern is that though several large transport projects have been conceptualized and are even being implemented, there is uncertainty on whether these will be finished on time, not least because of hurdles like evading environmental damage and acceptable rehabilitation of project-affected persons. For example, while work on the 22-km Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) has begun, there are concerns over how the project’s implementation is achieved without mangrove destruction. The same with the proposed coastal road and the Bandra-Versova sea link. Open SpacesPoor planning, haphazard construction and unabated encroachment of public spaces have resulted in living conditions deteriorating for the city’s residents in terms of light, air and a healthy environment. BMC statistics show that in the island city, on an average, over 45,000 people are cramped into every sq km. In comparison, Singapore, with a population less than half of Mumbai and an international reputation of being congested, has a ratio of just over 7,000 people per sq km. More frightful is data like that there are only under ten public swimming pools to cater to all of Mumbai. It gets even more depressing when one realizes that the city has 30 sq km of open spaces, of which only 10.5 sq km are freely accessible to the public. The actual open space in use works out to 0.88 sq m, or a little over 9 sq ft, per person. Making things worse, many plots reserved as open spaces are occupied by informal settlements. Even as the city’s population has increased, large swathes of land reserved for public amenities have been either encroached on by slums or de-reserved for construction purposes. Mumbai’s mangroves, playgrounds, parks, waterfronts and even protected forest lands are being steadily chewed up by slums, swanky housing societies, commercial complexes and now, by big infra. It is time for the civic administration to audit public open spaces to check their condition and extent of exploitation. MLAs are key to protecting open spaces in their constituencies from exploitation, but they turn a blind eye to violation for reasons that have to do with networks of patronage. For example, the city has 1,068 playgrounds and gardens, of which 29 are in the custody of trusts or institutions controlled by politicians. Some are being commercially exploited. As a course-correction, MLAs can begin by respecting open spaces of their own electorates. Environment and DevelopmentThe sharp divide between environmental balance and growth is one debate that flares up in Mumbai time and again. Most recently, and something that continues to be in the spotlight, is the Aarey Metro car shed issue. Over 2,700 tress are proposed to be removed to accommodate the car shed. While under 500 are being transplanted, the authorities have promised to plant six saplings for every tree cut, making environmentalists and ordinary citizens see red given the low rate of survival of transplanted trees, and the uncertainty over saplings becoming fully grown trees, not to mention the long time a tree takes to grow. The development vs ecology debate arises in the first place as Mumbai is one of the densest cities in the world, making land scarce for large infrastructure projects. Since the buildable area available for development has been largely used up, agencies are now dipping into what are classified as or at least should be nonbuildable areas in the city. On one hand, the city’s overburdened suburban rail system needs alternatives like the Metro rail and monorail, and on the other one simply cannot afford any more environmental degradation in a metropolis that has seen a gradual loss of tree cover over the decades. Not that there isn’t a way out of the impasse. The answer is superior planning and accountability. The authorities not only need to plan holistically, but also need to consult independent experts with a proven track record to find a balance between environment and development. The government needs to borrow from the book of cities like Singapore and Shanghai, which have world-class infrastructure along with some of the best tree-to-person ratios of the world’s urban areas. Cultural RevivalRecently, Mumbai ranked poorly in the liveability index published by The Economist magazine. This was chiefly because of the city’s deteriorating cultural health. The index has turned the spotlight back on the city’s art and culture community’s longstanding lament that while Mumbai possesses the talent and the creative software, it lacks the infrastructural hardware needed to back it. The leading lights of the city’s arts space believe that more public cultural venues and better government support for the arts would help rehabilitate Mumbai’s cultural vibrancy. While the city — which has fewer national museums to boast of than Singapore, fewer art galleries to brag about than Shanghai and fewer people visiting its museums than either of these cities — has witnessed a rise in the number of standup comedy nights, storytelling sessions and poetry slams over the last few years, these events are still limited to small pockets. Besides, independent musicians and folk artistes often find venues hard to come by. To revive its cultural scene, many in the art community reiterate the need for venues and funding that will help promote theatre in various languages, literary events, folk arts, live bands and independent musicians.

"Uddhav Thackeray tells MLAs CM post our dream, will get it with your help | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Uddhav Thackeray kept up his tough posture on Thursday even as Sena MLAs met the governor apparently to discuss loss to farmers caused by unsreasonal rain. The Sena and BJP had earlier met the governor separately on Monday. Uddhav, addressing MLAs at Sena Bhavan in the afternoon, said the Sena would have talks with BJP provided the BJP admits that a ""50:50"" power-sharing deal had been reached between the allies prior to the Lok Sabha polls. On Fadnavis' statement that the BJP had given no assurance about sharing the CM's post, Uddhav said, ""What's the point in having further talks if you (BJP) are not admitting the formula had been finalized? The CM should not have spoken like that when only three of us, myself, Amit Shah and Devendraji, were part of that meeting."" Thackeray also insisted the CM's post was the Sena's dream. ""I run a political party and if I wish there should be a Sena CM, what's wrong with it? It is my insistence, and I will do it with the help of you all."" Reiterating he could not resolve the BJP's problems always, Uddhav said, ""One cannot sit in the CM's chair forever"" and noted that the Sena also had other options and was in touch with the Congress and NCP. Uddhav also said he had not received any proposal from the BJP offering the Sena the deputy CM's post and 13 ministerial posts. Also, barely two days after Fadnavis took exception to Saamna's hostile anti-BJP tone, the Sena mouthpiece on Thursday urged the CM to honour Sena's 50:50 formula, including sharing of chief ministership for 2.5 years each. ""Maharashtra is known for its aggressive nature. This gives us the strength to fight. Those who are ready for a combat will not be deterred by crises,"" said Saamna. There were reports earlier that the BJP had asked Matoshree not to include Saamna executive editor Sanjay Raut in the Sena leaders' panel to hold government formation talks. In an editorial, Saamna said, ""In alliance politics, honouring the power-sharing formula is of far greater significance than the actual tally of the seats won... The wick of the 'yuti' (alliance) was lit by trust. This is a matter of trust."" The paper noted, ""Addressing mediapersons, the CM used the term 'sharing of power.' Those who think CMship doesn't fall under the purview of 'office of power' need lessons in civics. Equal distribution covers everything."" Referring to Fadnavis' statement that everything will go by what has been decided by BJP-Sena, Saamna asked, ""If everything has been decided, why this crisis (over 50-50 formula)? If CMship is considered not a power post, why such a stir over it?"" It stated, ""You don't need to quote scriptures to implement what has been mutually decided. Today, people place their hand on the holy book and utter lies. However, the Sena believes in keeping its promise. This is what Balasaheb (Thackeray) has taught us.""

Maharashtra assembly: Nandurbar MLAs posed 1 query in 4 years | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: An analysis of Question Hour in the state assembly during 2015-18 has revealed a heavy bias against issues concerning the marginalised. ""Our focus was on nine low-HDI districts , and we were shocked to find their negligible representation on the floor of the House,"" said Medha Kulkarni of the NGO Sampark, which studied 9,835 questions raised by MLAs during 2015-18 assembly sessions. Only one was raised from Nandurbar, the district with the state's lowest HDI. Its MLAs are Kagda Padvi, Surupsingh Naik, DS Ahire and Kashiram Pawara of Congress, and UK Padvi and Vijaykumar Gavit from BJP. While the reason for Mumbai topping the list could owe to its 23 constituencies-the largest for any district-experts said that tribal MLAs need to speak up. ""Also, questions have to be registered online before they are asked in the assembly. Adivasi MLAs perhaps don't have good online exposure,"" said Kulkarni. The survey also found that the general quality of questions was poor. ""Most queries were about local-level administrative problems that need not be raised at the assembly level,"" she said. For instance, questions on ashramshalas for children were about encroachment by rats and snakes. Less than 10% of questions were about policy matters. ""It seems people seek out their elected representatives for petty matters and they, in turn, take it to the highest electoral collective in the state-the assembly. It would seem we get the representatives we deserve,"" Kulkarni said. The common subjects repeated over and over were vacant posts, delayed projects, demand for CT scan machines, illegal construction, investor frauds, scams in district cooperative banks and river pollution. Dr Abhijit More of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (which was not involved in the analysis) said, ""Many a time, MLAs who are supposed to be the voice of the people get stuck in politics. They will vociferously talk about scams to shame their political opponent, but not about livelihood. If discussions on scams yield meaningful results that make a difference to the common man, then it is wonderful, but nothing like that happens here. If marginalised people don't get represented well in the assembly, then their MLAs are not doing their job."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Maharashtra elections: A civic hygiene crisis has put enormous pressure on tree cover | Pune News - Times of India,"Residents here said they want their MLA to immediately resolve the problems of sanitation, illegal construction and depleting tree cover. Those living in Shivane, Uttamnagar, Narhe and Dhayari — some of the villages that were merged with PMC over a year ago — said they are still waiting for improved delivery of civic services. “Many housing societies in Dhayari do not even have a proper sewage line connection. We do not have a proper system for drinking water supply either. And as far as safety is concerned, there are many roads without any streetlighting,” said Sanket Paygude, a resident of Dhayari. The civic body has also been struggling to properly dispose household waste. “The hills in our areas have turned into dumping grounds for household and construction waste,” said professor Kavita Murugkar, a resident of Warje, who added that garbage was slowly eating into the constituency’s green cover. “Littering on roads and near the hills is a big menace. The local administration has been developing parks, but none of them can be easily accessed by the elderly or people with disabilities,” Murugkar said.Residents also demanded the widening of the Nanded phata chowk on the Sinhagad road. “This road is heavily congested during the weekends. Several hundred tourists use the stretch to visit Sinhagad fort and the Khadakwasla dam site,” she said. Suraj Kalokhe, another resident, said authorities should do more to improve living conditions. “There is no civic hospital for the entire Nanded phata area. Many bylanes of Sinhagad road do not have streetlights. The concreting work of this road started a year ago, but it has potholes.” Amol Joshi, a resident of Warje Malwadi area said: “We are a combination of urban and rural zones. But construction has impacted green cover. There have been numerous instances of tree cutting.

Maharashtra elections: Drones used by parties also part of expenditure monitor | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Election Commission officials on Thursday said money spent on drones and mobile video vans by candidates and parties in the runup to the October 21 battle of ballots in Maharashtra would be included as part of the poll expenditures. The officials said the monitoring cell of the poll panel was keeping a close eye on the video recordings of the campaigns and interactions and items such as drones and mobile video vans would be included in the expenditure check mechanism. The EC had on September 21 announced the Maharashtra assembly polls. During the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, many candidates had said a number of political parties and their leaders in the fray used drones to record campaigns. “We checked the videos and there was evidence of drones being used. Keeping this in mind, we have decided to include the gadget in the poll expenditure list,” said a senior official in the expenditure monitoring cell. Besides drones, mobile video vans and even bullock carts would be included as part of the poll expenditure by the parties and the candidates. The expense cap per candidate in a constituency is Rs 28 lakh for the assembly polls as against Rs 70 lakh in the Lok Sabha elections. “The rates of drones and mobile video vans will be fixed. The amount for using these will be deducted from the expenditure of the candidates. If a star campaigner is found using any of the items, its expenditure will be deducted from the candidate’s account for whom he or she has canvassed,” an official said. The EC officials said the candidates have to file their respective accounts within 30 days of the election. The transactional money through banking channels will also be monitored. Special expenditure observers have been appointed for the state and also each assembly constituency. The EC has appointed two former Indian Revenue Service officers, Madhu Mahajan and B Murali Kumar, as special expenditure observers for the Maharashtra assembly elections. In consultation with the Chief Electoral Officer in Mumbai, they would have to monitor the “poll conduct” with special emphasis on controlling any abuse of money power.

Maharashtra elections: A push towards better policy and planning | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Picking up pace of key projects such as the 24x7 water supply scheme; increasing the per capita tree ratio from 1 to 7; and an underpass near University Chowk were some of the proposals discussed by citizens and candidates as part of the Citizen Manifesto meet for the Shivajinagar and Parvati constituencies. Candidates hoping to enter the state assembly discussed pan-city problems and also issues that concerned their constituencies. “For example, the sewage treatment plants (STP) are today located along the city’s rivers. This is hazardous for the environment and hardly of any use. Ideally, these units should be moved away from water bodies,” said Hema Chari, a citizen. She also raised the issue of the depleting groundwater table. Problems such as frequent flash floods and heavy bursts of rain are real concerns for the city. In my opinion, a climate emergency should be declared for areas that fall within Pune city limits,” she said. Vaishali Patakar, a resident of Shivajinagar, said lastmile connectivity would be a crucial factor in ensuring equal opportunities for citizens. “The increased use of public transport is the need of hour. Claims were made about procurement of 900 public transport buses during the last election, but the status of that proposal is still unclear. There were talks of introducing e-rickshaws, but nothing has happened on that front either,” she said. Other participants said major projects in the city were yet to take off. They insisted on transparency and accountability during the planning and execution phases. “Ulterior motives seem to prevail when it comes to prioritising projects. There is no policy paralysis when it comes to executing projects that interest elected members. But projects that benefit the city are often low on priority. The plan for projects such as the high-capacity mass transit route (HCMTR) has changed, which is wrong,” said Rajeev Savant, a citizen. Satya Natarajan, another citizen, asked for better tree protection measures. “Details of the Maharashtra Tree Act should be available to all.

""We are regular tax payers and voters too. For more than 15 years, we have been demanding road widening and removal of encroachments on the footpaths near our societies. What we got in return is encroachments everywhere and traffic congestion. Why then should we vote?"" the banners say. Residents of Shrushti Society, Vatsalyanagari and Guru Ganeshnagar along the DP Road in Kothrud may boycott the assembly elections. They are tired of the encroachments and traffic problems they have been facing for over a decade and angry about the authorities and local political leaders looking the other way. Members of Shrushti Society were the first to put up the banner last week. On Tuesday, the other two societies joined them. A resident of Shrushti society, who did not wish to be named, told TOI that for the past 14 years the residents have been suffering from neglect. ""The road from Ashish Garden chowk to our society is already narrow and has become narrower due to encroachments,"" he said. The Pune Municipal Corporation has removed some encroachments and shifted the rest to other areas. ""But there are now shops selling meat, cycle repair shops and shops collecting old newspapers and rags. Residents also face severe traffic congestion every day. The authorities are doing nothing,"" he said. DP Road is one of the most congested routes in Kothrud. During peak hours, congestion can cause endless traffic jams. One resident said haphazard parking at the entrance of the society is also a major problem . ""About six months ago, a woman from our housing society was going out on her two-wheeler with her child. Someone knocked her down at the entrance. She fractured her leg and cannot step out of her home now."" During the election campaigning in 2014, residents said the candidates had promised them a solution to the problems. ""However, after the elections, when we approached the leaders to remind them about their assurances, they simply told us that the matter is in the court,"" he said.

Maharashtra: Aghadi drafts stategy for speaker’s election | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: A day after the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) won the vote of confidence motion, it drafted a strategy for the crucial election for the speaker’s post on Sunday. While Congress has nominated Nana Patole, the high-profile legislator from Sakoli, BJP has fielded Murbad legislator Kisan Kathore for the post. Though legislature rules provide for a secret ballot for the speaker’s elections, MVA will invoke Rule 57 of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Rules to seek open voting. A senior NCP leader said this would allow a member of the house to move a proposal to suspend a particular motion which the speaker is empowered to accept. “A member can move a resolution urging the house to suspend the provision of secret voting. Then the speaker will have to put up the proposal for a vote before the house. If the members agree by majority, then the speaker will suspend the rule for secret voting and conduct the election for the speaker’s post in the open,” he said. The NCP leader said on Saturday the BJP deliberately did not participate in voting on the motion of confidence so that its real strength in the house will not be known. Under such circumstances, if a member moves a proposal under Rule 57, the speaker will put up the proposal to vote on Sunday. “It will be a piquant situation for the BJP. If it votes against the proposal, then even before the voting for the speaker’s post, its strength will be known in the house. If it boycotts the proceedings, there will be no secret ballot for the speaker’s election. In that event, too, its strength will be known,” he said. Former speaker Dilip Walse Patil, who has been appointed the pro tem speaker, will play a crucial role on Sunday when the speaker will be elected. Meanwhile, Saturday was Walse Patil’s day as he took on former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, said political observers. “BJP felt that it will catch Walse Patil unawares, but he proved them wrong by tactfully replying to issues raised by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis,’’ he said.

"Maharashtra elections: Crime, power outages and lack of public transport trouble a key industrial hub of Bhosari constituency | Pune News - Times of India","The Bhosari constituency has over the years grown to become the ‘economic engine’ of Pimpri Chinchwad. But the industrial town, home to several prominent units, has been grappling with a range of issues, including serious crime. Groups here have been accused of extortion and kidnapping attempts — aimed at arm-twisting factory units into awarding them important contracts on workers, scrap management and water supply. According to cops, an average of over 100 crimes linked to industry in Bhosari are registered every year with the Bhosari MIDC police station. Appasaheb Shinde, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture, said: “These groups are a menace to the industrial belt. They extort money from industrialists. They even loot workers of the units here. If their hard-earned money is not secure, why would they continue working in Bhosari? Just setting up a police station will not change the scenario. The authorities should implement necessary counter measures to change the situation.” However, it’s not just crime. The power supply infrastructure for the industrial belt is now well over four decades old. As a result, outages are frequent and, according to heads of factories, have started to impact output. “This is a daily problem for us,” said Sandeep Belsare, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Small Industries Association. “We requested officials several times to replace electric cables in the area. We even asked for a complete revamp of the power infrastructure. But we have not received a positive response.” Another concern has been river pollution. “A proposal to set up a common effluent treatment plant (CETP) has been pending with the civic authorities and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation for the last 10 years. Many industries today have no choice but eject effluents into rivers,” said an official of the association, who did not wish to be named. “We have been paying large sums as property tax to the PCMC since 1983. But we still struggle because of the lack of basic amenities. Our roads are full of potholes; the drainage system is not sufficient and key junctions are almost always waterlogged during the rains,” the official added. Poor road transport is another problem that has troubled workers of the units. “Over one lakh people come to work here. We could’ve used more PMPML buses,” said Abhay Bhor of the Forum of Small Scale Industries Association (FSSIA). Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Maharashtra elections: Uddhav Thackeray mum on Aarey at Shiv Sena’s Dasara rally | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Uddhav Thackeray maintained a conspicuous silence on the Aarey car shed row in his annual Dasara speech on the Shivaji Park grounds on Tuesday. By keeping mum on the issue, Thackeray could well be assuaging the BJP, Shiv Sena’s senior saffron ally, said party watchers. Thackeray’s silence on the felling of trees in Aarey has surprised many, including Sainiks. A section of the Sena rank and file is worried the Aarey agitation could be a rallying point for anti-saffron sentiment in the city ahead of the assembly polls. While Thackeray, in his speech, exhorted youth to join public life and shape policies, city observers pointed out the Aarey issue in that case was even more important as a large number of the 29 protesters arrested on Friday night, when the administration undertook felling of trees, were students, many of them preparing for their exams. Thackeray had told mediapersons after the Bombay high court judgment turning down the greens’ plea last week, that those responsible for the massacre of Aarey trees will be severely dealt with once the new government is sworn in. His son, Yuva Sena chief Aaditya, had also tweeted on the Aarey’s rich biodiversity and had been trolled for sticking to Twitter instead of taking to the streets to stop the “massacre”. “Hence it came as a surprise that Uddhavji should refrain from mentioning Aarey in the Dasara rally, which holds a special significance in Sena’s calendar as the party chief is supposed to spell out his views on matters of public importance,” said a social activist. Though in the second part of his interview to Sena mouthpiece Saamna, which appeared on Tuesday morning, Thackeray spoken about his party’s objection to tree felling in Aarey, saying Sena was not against the car shed but the place where it has been proposed and that “development should not happen by causing hardships to people,” he had been expected to take up the issue at the annual gathering of Sainiks. Thackeray spent a greater part of his speech justifying his party’s poll alliance with BJP and trying to convince Sainiks that he had agreed to take a cut in the share of seats as BJP had been facing difficulties. Thackeray, however, didn’t refer even once to Aaditya’s candidature from Worli. Toeing BJP’s line, he demanded a Uniform Civil Code to ensure equality and social justice to all. He also backed Union home minister Amit Shah’s plan for a nationwide NRC and urged the Centre to throw illegal migrants out. He reiterated his demand that the Centre should make legal amendments to speed up construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He also announced a slew of sops, including a Rs 10 meal across the state, health check-up for one rupee, power subsidy and farm loan waiver. Taking a mild dig at the BJP, Thackeray, quoting his father, the late Balasaheb, said those in power should be “humble.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra elections: Schools, colleges hit as 75% staff on poll duty | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Many city schools and colleges are struggling to conduct mid-term exams, with up to 75% of their staff deployed for election duty. While some have postponed junior college exams to after Diwali vacations, others are managing with limited staff. Colleges claimed some non-teaching staff deployed for Lok Sabha elections are still being called for work for over three months. This, when city colleges are already facing a staff shortage. A SoBo college professor said they do not have enough teachers to supervise exams. ""It is a daily struggle. Most non-teaching staff are away on election duty and some, deployed for duty in May, are continuing. They are told to report for long hours,"" said the professor. A prominent college in central Mumbai decided to schedule class XI and XII exams post-Diwali as most teachers are called for election duty. ""In senior college, the problem is not as severe, as we have unaided section teachers filling up for aided teachers who are deployed for election work,"" said the principal. At some colleges, teachers have applied for exemption, citing personal problems; many exemptions were permitted. At V G Vaze College, Mulund, junior college exams will begin after Diwali vacations. ""Almost everyone is on election duty. While election training is mostly on holidays, it's election day which will be a holiday, plus the next day, that is always troublesome as election work continues till midnight for some of the polling party. So, if two crucial days are wasted, we would have to advance the exam by two days. It would have been exam in lieu of teaching,"" said vice-principal Vidyadhar Joshi. Some schools which advanced exams had to make a last-minute cancellation. tnn Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra elections: After Marathas, BJP hopes to woo Dhangars | Kolhapur News - Times of India","Kolhapur: Caste dynamics and the aspirations of different communities in Maharashtra kept the BJP on tenterhooks over the past five years. But the party can breathe a lot easier now after winning over the dominant Marathas by fulfilling their decades-old demand for reservations. The Marathas were the backbone of the NCP and Congress but the victory of saffron alliance candidates in the community’s strongholds point to a shift in allegiance. In this year’s Lok Sabha elections, BJP-Sena won 42 of the 48 seats at stake, the same number as in 2014. Observers have attributed this to the support of the Maratha community following the reservations. The Maharashtra government had issued an ordinance granting 16% reservation to Marathas in jobs and education. The Bombay high court heard arguments against the ordinance but reserved its judgment. In July, the Supreme Court refused to stay the ordinance but issued a notice to the state government on pleas challenging the HC order. The government’s reservation offer gave the BJP a huge opportunity to expand beyond its three-decade-old social engineering experiment that had helped the party shed its traditional Brahmanical image. Under this experiment, popularly known as MADHAV, the BJP brought leaders from the Mali (Ma), Dhangar (Dha) and Vanjari (V) communities into Maharashtra’s political scape. It was the brainchild of the late BJP veteran Vasantrao Bhagwat, who groomed leaders like the late N S Pharande of the Mali community, Annasaheb Dange of the Dhangar community and the late Gopinath Munde from the Vanjari community. BJP credits this experiment for its growth beyond the traditional support base from the 1990s. However, the Dhangar community remains miffed with the state government for not taking a stand on its demand for reservations. The BJP has recently inducted into its fold Gopichand Padalkar, a prominent leader of the community, and fielded him against Ajit Pawar in NCP’s bastion Baramati. Padalkar had contested the LS elections on a Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi (VBA) ticket and had criticized the BJP government for delaying reservations for the Dhangars. Now, he told TOI that he has joined the BJP as he felt it was the only party that was serious about the community’s demand for reservations. The BJP had committed to granting reservations to the Dhangars if it were elected to power in 2014, a promise it has failed to keep. Spread over Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Pune districts and parts of the Marathwada region, the Dhangar community comprises 9% of the state’s population and plays a decisive role in an estimated 30-35 assembly seats in western Maharashtra alone. Till it takes a call on reservations, the state government has rolled out a Rs 1,000 crore package for the Dhangars. They will reap benefits from 22 government schemes. So far, the Congress and NCP have not raised Maratha reservations during its campaign, fearing that it may boomerang on them. On the other hand, the BJP is upbeat on the issue. BJP workers had put up hoardings on NH-4 passing through Kolhapur, describing Fadnavis as the “architect of Maratha reservation” when his Mahajanadesh yatra reached western Maharashtra. However, the Marathas, who comprise 30-32% of the population in the state, have some grievances about the implementation of the reservation policy. They feel securing caste certificates to claim quota benefits has become a challenge. Vasantrao Mulik, Kolhapur president of the Akhil Bharatiya Maratha Mahasangh, said there were several difficulties at the administrative level. “We have to face a lot of problems while submitting documents. The benefit of the state government decision is not reaching needy individuals,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra elections: For 1,500 voters, Andheri to Bandra is a 30-sec walk - Times of India","MUMBAI: Imagine stepping out of Andheri and finding yourself in Bandra. Amazingly, you don’t need Hyperloop to breach the traffic—you just have to live on Relief Road. It’s a single conglomeration of housing societies, but splits its votes between two assembly constituencies and even two parliamentary constituencies. The rub is, not all residents are happy about this arrangement because there is an administrative mismatch between the ward they belong to and their higher electoral representation. The Relief Road Housing Societies Association in Santa Cruz has 4,500 people living in 1,200 flats. In 1997, Relief Road, an apt name for a pathway that doesn’t get any traffic owing to a dead end towards Juhu airport, was delineated as the dividing line between the Bandra West and Andheri West assembly constituencies and also between the Mumbai North East and Mumbai North West parliamentary constituencies. On the road’s north-eastern alignment are around 400 flats with nearly 1,500 residents occupying 10 of the conglomeration’s 40 societies. Geographically, these 10 societies form one of the southernmost fringes of the Andheri West constituency and are cut off from its mainstream by the presence of Juhu Airport and the SNDT University campus in between. Residents say this puts them at a disadvantage as, following their separation from Bandra West—to which the remaining part of their society conglomerate belongs—they are sort of in no man’s land in terms of civic works and funding. “We were part of Bandra, constituency-wise, till 1997 and were administered by the H-West ward (includes Bandra-W). For the next 20 years, we were part of K-West (includes Andheri). This was a time when our ward, and assembly and parliamentary constituencies were aligned. But in the delimitation exercise before the 2017 civic polls, we were put back in HWest ward,” says society secretary Raghavanand Haridas, who is also a trustee of HWest Ward Citizens Trust. “So now, though at the ward level we are in Bandra, our higher electoral representation is in Andheri. This creates problems for us in securing constituency funds.” Haridas says the residents’ association gave several representations to the Election Commission to unify the electoral representation of the Relief Road conglomerate, including one just before the Lok Sabha polls, but things haven’t changed. “Unfortunately, we are in the fringes, whether it’s our ward, or our assembly or parliamentary area status,” he says. “And we are treated accordingly. Like people in the fringes tend to be.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest Politics News."

People will punish government for politics of revenge: Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat | Mumbai News - Times of India,"For 66-year-old Congress state unit president Balasaheb Thorat, the assembly election next month is a major challenge. As he takes on the saffron combine, he also has to set his own house in order, what with groupism rife and mass exodus the order of the day. So far, his big achievement has reaching an understanding with the NCP and smaller parties on the seat-sharing formula in the first meeting itself - 125 each for Congress and NCP, and 38 seats for smaller parties. Thorat shares some thoughts with Prafulla Marpakwar. The ED has initiated criminal proceedings against NCP president Sharad Pawar and his nephew. There are Congress, BJP, Shiv Sena, PWP politicians too ... In my opinion, it appears to be politically motivated, since Sharad Pawar was never on the board of directors of the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank. The NDA government will have to pay a heavy price for initiating criminal proceedings against Sharad Pawar. I will not be surprised if the Congress-NCP sweeps the poll, as people will express their anger against the government. People of Maharashtra dislike politics of revenge. Main issues during the campaign? Congress-NCP will focus on failure of the BJP-led government on all fronts. When (CM Devendra) Fadnavis took over in October 2014, he had painted a rosy picture, now it appears that he has not been able to deliver the goods. There is no end to farmers' suicides, no jobs are available, a large number of factories and industrial units have been closed, prices of essential commodities are beyond the reach of the common man. The much-publicised loan waiver scheme has failed to take off, even the pension scheme for farmers appears to be a non-starter. Are you worried over the mass exodus? Certainly, it is a matter of concern, but we are not worried. We have several options to replace those who left the Congress. During the Lok Sabha elections, Congress was completely wiped out, it won only one seat. I think, the political situation in Maharashtra has changed after the Lok Sabha election. Issues during the Lok Sabha and assembly polls are different. ... BJP will not be able to emotionally blackmail voters. It is misleading the people over Article 370. It will not have any impact during the assembly election. ... BJP did win the Lok Sabha election, but lost assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan.

Maharashtra elections: Daily life in the industrial belt can be a struggle | Pune News - Times of India,"Thousands of residential complexes have been illegally constructed within the ‘red zone’ areas of Bhosari, Dighi, Charholi and Moshi towns over the years, said civic activists and citizens. No construction is allowed within a radius of 1,145 metres from the Magazine Depot in Dighi where raw material for ammunition such as TNT and C powder are stored. The ‘red zone’ restriction aims to prevent collateral damage in the event of an incident. “There has been no revamp of this British-era ammo depot. So curbs on construction within its vicinity is necessary for the safety of people,” said a senior official from the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), who added that authorities in the area have not taken any action to stop sale of buffer land to realtors. “Why can’t politicians ignore party lines and take action against illegal construction in the area? We’re talking about people’s lives,” said Avinash Tengle, a small-scale industrialist and resident of Sadgurunagar in Bhosari, Residents also lamented the poor drinking water supply across Dighi, Charholi and Moshi; failure of drainage lines in Dighi; poor traffic infrastructures in Bhosari Gaothan; and encroachment along the Bhosari–Alandi road and the busy Pune–Nashik highway. “Several housing societies have to get drinking water through tankers. The pilot project to supply water 24/7 in Dighi has completely failed too,” said activist Sachin Godambe from Dighi. “Ever since the expansion of the Pune–Alandi road, many construction sites have come up in Dighi, Charoli and Moshi areas. Population in these towns is expected to grow in the next five years. But where is the drinking water?” he asked. Accumulation of rainwater in residential societies, particularly in low lying areas of Dighi, has been another long pending issue. “No drainage line has been constructed along the hill in Dighi. As a result, rainwater continues to enter housing societies of the area. No concrete step has been taken to address this issue,” said Rohit Dighe, a working professional from Dighi. Poor garbage collection is the biggest issue in Moshi and Charholi. “The civic garbage collection service is not up to the mark. Residents of many housing societies have to collect garbage themselves and dump it at the garbage depot. At some places, people have started dumping and burning waste in open areas. Such practices have triggered serious health issues for residents across this constituency.

The opposition is too weak to the challenge the developmental work carried out by central and state governments. Hence, they will be reduced to single digit in Maharashtra,” Hussain, who was in Nashik for addressing a gathering on Article 370 and the Article 35 A, said. He also claimed that since 1986, the time he entered politics, he had never seen the opposition in such a bad shape. “The opposition is unable to find any weak link that they could cash on against the state government,” Hussain said.

Maharashtra assembly polls: Jolt for Congress as sitting MLA joins BJP | Nashik News - Times of India,"NASHIK: In a severe jolt to the UPA in North Maharashtra, two-time sitting Congress legislator from the reserved Shirpur assembly segment in Dhule, Kashiram Pawara, joined the BJP in Mumbai on Monday in presence of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and state BJP president Chandrakant Patil. “I have joined the BJP because since I feel that I can develop my constituency in a better manner if I am a part of the government. I am sure that NDA will continue to be in power after the assembly elections,” Kashiram said. Shirpur, a reserved seat for tribal candidates, has been one of the strongest bastions of Congress in North Maharashtra with party continuing its winning streak in assembly polls for over three decades. Dhule Congress leaders were taken aback by Kashiram’s sudden departure from the party. “We did not have any idea that he (Kashiram) would desert Congress at this crucial juncture. He could have made a more gracious exit from the party by announcing his plans prior to joining the BJP,” district Congress chief Shyam Saner told TOI. Saner, however, exuded confidence that the Shirpur residents have been traditional Congress voters and party would still emerge victorious in the assembly polls. After Kashiram’s exit, one of the names doing rounds for contesting the elections on Congress ticket is that of two-time zilla parishad member Ranjit Pawara. Apart from Kashiram, Congress Shirpur taluka chief Prabhakar Chavan also joined the BJP. Some local Congress leaders are of the view that Kashiram could have joined BJP as he felt that it could have been difficult for him to retain the seat given the Lok Sabha results. In the recent Lok Sabha elections, BJP emerged on top in Shirpur assembly segment, which is a part of the Nandurbar parliamentary constituency, by garnering 1.17 lakh votes.

"Maharashtra assembly polls: Get set, vote! | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: One of the striking features of Pune, as compared to other Indian cities, is its sizeable student population. Turn anywhere, from MG Road to FC Road, from Tathavade to Katraj, there is no place in the city without students. With assembly elections approaching, a major point of discussion among students is politics. ToI@campus spoke with student leaders across the spectrum, to understand the major issues that concern them and what do they expect from the political party that wins the polls. Kuldeep Ambekar, president of Yuva Loktantrik Janata Dal, said that their biggest demand is to increase the government’s investment in the education sector to between 6% and 8% of the GDP. Enumerating his demands, the law student from Marathwada Mitra Mandal College said, “The sports played at Olympics should be introduced at colleges and universities. The government should provide funding for these sports. A government-recognized degree for a career in politics should also be introduced. These courses should be conducted by the university. Employment-based skill courses need to be introduced in rural areas and education loan to students should be given without security.” According to Kalpesh Yadav, city president of the Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena and an MPSC aspirant, there is an urgent need to set up a ‘Vishakha Samiti’ or an Internal Complaints Committee at all colleges to safeguard students’ safety. “Better hostel facilities, a transparent admission policy, prominent display of fee regulation laws and scholarship schemes, etc, are also needed. Tech festivals and start-up events must be held by the state so that students are provided a platform to develop their imagination as well as advanced technology skills,” said Yadav. The Mahapariksha portal, which conducts exams to various posts in the state government at present, has been mired in controversies hence it needs to be scrapped, pointed out Kalyani Mangave, of Maharashtra Youth Congress. Mangave is a postgraduate student of law at Shivaji University, Kolhapur. “Unemployment is our biggest problem and to counter it, we want the government to fill up over 1,90,000 vacant posts in various sectors within 100 days of its formation. The examination fee for all public service examinations must be scrapped for students,” Mangave stated. Dayanand Shinde, a second-year student of the Hindi department at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and president of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, called for a centralized recruitment process for professors at all state colleges and universities. “PhD research students must get higher stipends. Students who are eligible for scholarships must get the amount in a timely manner. The students, who have enrolled for the Earn And Learn scheme must get a higher honorarium,” said Shinde. For Kamalakar Shete, a second-year MCom student at SPPU and member of the Yuva Kranti Dal (Yukrand), free education for all from kindergarten to postgraduate courses and a free bus pass for girl students are the biggest demands. “Students from rural areas belonging to economically weaker sections of the society must be given priority in getting hostel accommodation. Accommodation and food are the biggest problems faced by students. This issue must be resolved by the government. The scholarship process is extremely complicated despite being online. The process must be streamlined. Universities and colleges should also provide students with health insurance,” said Shete. Mohammad Saif, an LLB student at New Law Academy at Azam Campus and founder of the Welfare Association of Youth, said that among his top demands are free transportation for students coming from a remote region of the state during the time of vacations, free or cheaper accommodation (hostel) facilities for students coming from the Muslim-community. “Muslim students should be provided special reservation in college hostels as they find it difficult to get accommodation in apartments. Also, they should get preference at reputed government institutes such as the Indian Institute of Technology and Indian Institute of Management. Muslim students must also be provided preference in government jobs at various levels,” added Saif. Ashok Chate, a second-year student of the Marathi department at SPPU and member of the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) called for a minimum scholarship for all students program. “The Earn And Learn scheme must be transparently enforced in rural areas as well. A fee regulation committee must be instituted by the university so that colleges that seek excess fees can be punished. All girls must get a free bus pass so that travelling to the institute is not a problem. In cities that see a large number of student population, hostels must be built exclusively for students coming from Marathwada, Vidarbha, other and such areas,” said Chate. “I want teachers to be recruited to vacant positions in a transparent manner. The number of fellowships must be increased. The Mahapariksha portal must be suspended. The autonomous status should be abrogated as it actually promotes privatization. Sex education, gender equality, and awareness must be provided periodically to students. Skill education must be prioritized. There should be an efficient placement cell for students belonging to the Arts stream. For girl students, education until the post-graduation level must be made free-of-cost,” said Satish Gore, an MPhil student in the English department at SPPU and secretary of the Maharashtra Youth Congress.

In 1997, Relief Road, an apt name for a pathway that doesn’t get any traffic owing to a dead end towards Juhu airport, was delineated as the dividing line between the Bandra West and Andheri West assembly constituencies and also between the Mumbai North East and Mumbai North West parliamentary constituencies. On the road’s north-eastern alignment are around 400 flats with nearly 1,500 residents occupying 10 of the conglomeration’s 40 societies. Geographically, these 10 societies form one of the southernmost fringes of the Andheri West constituency and are cut off from its mainstream by the presence of Juhu Airport and the SNDT University campus in between. Residents say this puts them at a disadvantage as, following their separation from Bandra West—to which the remaining part of their society conglomerate belongs—they are sort of in no man’s land in terms of civic works and funding. “We were part of Bandra, constituency-wise, till 1997 and were administered by the H-West ward (includes Bandra-W). For the next 20 years, we were part of K-West (includes Andheri). This was a time when our ward, and assembly and parliamentary constituencies were aligned. But in the delimitation exercise before the 2017 civic polls, we were put back in HWest ward,” says society secretary Raghavanand Haridas, who is also a trustee of HWest Ward Citizens Trust. “So now, though at the ward level we are in Bandra, our higher electoral representation is in Andheri. This creates problems for us in securing constituency funds.” Haridas says the residents’ association gave several representations to the Election Commission to unify the electoral representation of the Relief Road conglomerate, including one just before the Lok Sabha polls, but things haven’t changed. “Unfortunately, we are in the fringes, whether it’s our ward, or our assembly or parliamentary area status,” he says. “And we are treated accordingly. Like people in the fringes tend to be.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra elections: Congress, NCP tired, must merge, says Sushilkumar Shinde | Kolhapur News - Times of India","KOLHAPUR/NASHIK/MUMBAI: Senior Congress leader and former Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde stirred up a storm on Tuesday when he said that the grand old party and its alliance partner, the Sharad Pawarled NCP, were “tired” and needed to be merged. Pawar, however, dismissed Shinde’s comments, saying the NCP was “energetic” and geared up to face the state assembly elections. Even state Congress president Balasaheb Thorat dismissed the idea. “Both parties are contesting the elections together, but there has been no discussion on a merger so far,” he said at a presser in Pune on Wednesday. Former deputy CM Ajit Pawar and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik also felt Shinde’s views were his own and that the Congress leadership had distanced itself from the comments. “It was Shinde’s personal comment, and there is no need to take it seriously. At no level was there any discussion about a merger. At the moment, we are concentrating on dislodging the saffron combine’s government in the assembly elections,” Malik said. A Congress leader said in the recent past, the issue of a merger has figured on several occasions. When the NCP chief met Sonia Gandhi six months ago, there was similar speculation but Pawar had then refuted the reports. Addressing a function after inaugurating the election office of Manohar Sapate, the NCP’s Solapur North candidate, on Tuesday, Shinde said he lamented the separate existence of the parties. “I am sure the other party feels the same, but it is not making it open,” he said. Shinde also commented on his age and that of Pawar (both are in their late seventies). He said several workers had expressed their sentiments about Pawar, wondering how he was still fighting elections. “I told them I too am of his (Pawar’s) age. Several leaders are old now and, as a result, the parties are feeling tired,” he said. Shinde has always described Pawar as his “political guru”, often saying he learnt politics from the NCP chief. Speaking to TOI, Shinde said he had expressed his individual opinion and there was a formal process on merging the two parties. Pawar, however, countered Shinde. In Jalgaon on Wednesday, Pawar said, “Shinde is from Congress and I am the NCP president. He knows his party better than me. And I know the status of my party much better than him. I think Shinde’s comments are directed towards his party.” Pawar also lashed out at the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, accusing it of failing to fulfil aspirations of people. “The state government has not undertaken any major development work in five years,” he said. On the revoking of Article 370, Pawar said barring two MPs, the entire Parliament had supported the Union government’s decision. “Unfortunately, BJP leaders are raking up this issue in the assembly polls to derive political mileage. But I am sure voters are prudent enough to understand the BJP’s gameplan. They will not fall for this trick,” he said. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the Congress and NCP share the same ideology and their priority is removal of “fascist” forces. “Anything can happen in the future,” he said.

"Poll station count down by 6,000 in rural parts of Maharashtra | Pune News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The number of polling stations in the rural parts of the state stands reduced by 6,248 compared to the 2014 figure, while the urban number has risen by 10,392. The figures reflect the rise in urbanisation in the state. “The reduction in rural polling stations shows that the area has moved from being a panchayat or nagar panchayat to a municipal council. This is part of the urbanisation process,” said an election official. There is one polling station per 1,400 voters in urban areas in the state. In rural areas, there is one polling station for every 1,200 voters. Overall, there are 96,654 polling stations in the state, up from 91,329 during the assembly polls of 2014. This is a rise of 5,325 polling stations, in keeping with the rise in the voting population. The rural-urban bifurcation data is available for 95,473 polling stations. The data shows that the number of rural polling stations fell from 62,062 during the assembly election in 2014 to 55,814 by 2019. During the same period, the number of urban polling stations rose from 29,267 to 39,659. “This is a trend one sees across the country with the growth in urbanisation. Rural polling stations have seen a decline even in other states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,” said psephologist Sanjay Kumar from the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies. Still, rural polling stations will tend to outnumber the urban ones since the bulk of the population continues to reside in rural areas. Does the growth in urbanisation affect the issues raised by political parties? Kumar feels it has a limited impact. “At the end of the day, the voting preferences of the rural and urban voter are not so different. Our surveys have shown that around 62-65% or rural voters and 68-70% of urban voters tend to vote for the political party, rather than the individual candidate,” said Kumar.

"Maharashtra assembly polls: BJP may field 4 new faces in Pune, Patil likely from Kothrud | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: The strong likelihood of the BJP fielding its state unit chief and revenue minister Chandrakant Patil from the Kothrud constituency here has set off sparks with its alliance partner Shiv Sena and some Brahmin outfits. Patil announced in Mumbai on Monday that he would contest the assembly elections though he did not say from where. But speculation has been strong for some time now that he would be offered Kothrud. Besides Kothrud, the BJP is also likely to field new candidates from three other assembly constituencies in Pune. Shivajinagar MLA Vijay Kale is likely to be replaced by corporator Siddharth Shirole, son of former MP Anil Shirole; Pune Cantonment MLA Dilip Kamble may lose the nomination to his younger brother Sunil, present chairman of the PMC's standing committee; and, mayor Mukta Tilak is likely to be fielded from Kasba Peth, which has been vacant since Girish Bapat won the LS election. Madhuri Misal (Parvati), Bhimrao Tapkir (Khadakwasla), Jagdish Mulik (Wadgaonsheri) and Yogesh Tilekar (Hadapsar) might be re-nominated. BJP insiders said Patil would merely be following the decision of the top brass in Delhi. In fact, Patil would always describe himself as an “envelope without address”, indicating he would go wherever the party wanted him to. Party sources said PM Modi and Amit Shah are keen on Patil becoming a member of the new House in the state and, therefore, have decided to field him from Kothrud, considered the strongest bastion of the BJP in western Maharashtra. No sooner was it known that Patil would be the party’s likely choice from Kothrud than banners opposing him went up in some parts of the constituency which read that the candidate should be a local person, not an outsider. Hailing from Kolhapur, Patil has never fought a state assembly election. He has been an MLC from the Pune graduates’ constituency since 2008 and his term ends in June next year. He is considered only next to the chief minister in the state cabinet. Chandrakant Mokate, former Sena MLA from the constituency, may rebel if Patil gets the ticket. Some groups from the Brahmin community, which dominates the constituency, have also opposed Patil’s possible candidature. Mokate had contested the assembly elections from Kothrud in 2014 but lost to BJP’s Medha Kulkarni. Patil was, in fact, exploring three constituencies in Kolhapur district — Kolhapur north, Chandgad and Radhanagari — but all are currently with the Sena. The Sena is unwilling to give up any of these seats. Moreover, contesting from Kolhapur would mean farmers' leader Raju Shetti would stand against him. Shetti is not inclined to fight Patil in an urban constituency like Kothrud. Parshuram Seva Sangh, a Brahmin outfit in Pune, has opposed any move to field Patil from Kothrud, saying the constituency was one of the few which give representation to the community. “Current MLA Medha Kulkarni could get elected from Kothrud in 2014 due to the community’s support. Even during the recent Lok Sabha elections, the Kothrud assembly segment gave party candidate Girish Bapat a lead of around 1 lakh votes,” said Vishwajit Deshpande of the outfit. Anand Dave of the Brahman Mahasangh said, ""We will not be happy if the BJP fields a person who has not done justice to issues regarding our community, like the Dadoji Konddeo and Ram Ganesh Gadkari statues. Patil also had a role in displacing Brahmins from the Kolhapur temple. He also did not entertain our issues regarding the community."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Kshirsagar gets Shiv Sena ticket, setback for Vinayak Mete | Aurangabad News - Times of India","AURANGABAD: Cabinet minister Jaidatta Kshirsagar, who ditched NCP on the face of Lok Sabha election to join Shiv Sena, received the AB form from the saffron party on Monday to contest from Beed assembly constituency. Kshirsagar, a prominent OBC face in Marathwada, had won 2014 assembly election from Beed on NCP ticket by defeating Shiv Sangram leader Vinayak Mete. The development has come as a setback to Mete, one BJP’s alliance partner, who was strongly pitching for his candidature from Beed seat. Mete, who has been at loggerheads with Kshirsagar and BJP leader Pankaja Munde, held a meeting with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis at Mumbai on Monday night to express his displeasure over the development. During Lok Sabha poll for Beed, Mete had openly declared selective non-cooperation to Pankaja’s sister and BJP candidate Pritam Munde even if his outfit is allied with BJP at the state level. Pritam’s victory increased difficulties for the Maratha leader. Mete in recent times had hinted that Fadnavis and state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil had assured him of assembly ticket from Beed. His close associates said the leader, who has a considerable following in the Maratha community, was expected to announce the future course of action after meeting with the CM. BJP sources said continuing his term as an MLC could be one of the options to pacify Mete and dissuade him from contesting assembly election from Beed. Shiv Sangram led by Mete has been demanding around five to six assembly seats, including Beed, from BJP. Beed assembly seat will now witness a battle between Kshirsagar and his estranged nephew Sandip Kshirsagar, whose candidature has been already announced by NCP chief Sharad Pawar. Both the candidates have already kickstarted their poll preparations by reaching out to voters from different sections. Sandip, grandson of late MP from Beed Kesharkaku Kshirsagar, is a third-generation emerging leader from a politically strong Kshirsagar family from Marathwada district. In his late 30s, he parted ways from his two uncles, including Jaidatta, to float Kaku Nana Vikas Aghadi, a few years ago. Amidst power tussle with his two uncles, including Bharatbushan, who is the chairman of Beed municipal council, the outfit floated by Sandip managed to emerge as the single largest party in municipal council polls in 2016. As Jaidutta developed irreparable differences with some of the top NCP leaders, NCP chief chose to back Sandip. Apart from the tussle between the Kshirsagar family members, All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (MIM) could play a crucial role in the upcoming election.

Maharashtra elections: Humidity &amp; rain further cut short campaign time | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Campaigning ends at 6pm on October 19 and candidates, already running short of time, are taking to social media platforms to connect with their voters. Heavy rain in the evening and high levels of humidity during the day have restricted the padayatra that candidates usually undertake across Pune city and neighbouring regions. “There is hardly any campaigning of any kind. Many of us don’t even know our candidates,’’ a voter from Kasba Peth assembly constituency said. There are just 11 days for the election. There was some fanfare on the day of filing nominations but no campaigns as yet, a resident of Kondhwa area that falls in Hadapsar and Pune Cantonment assembly constituencies said. “Nobody is even talking about the election in our society,’’ a resident from a huge complex in Kondhwa said. Several of the eight assembly constituencies in Pune city are huge. But political parties and their candidates are physically present only in certain areas. “ The time to campaign is too little,’’a candidate from a national party said. Big leaders have yet to reach key constituencies and independent candidates who received their symbols recently have to plan their campaigns. “We can only limit ourselves to certain areas as it is not possible to reach out to entire constituencies,’’ an independent candidate said. She has doubts about spending with just ten days left. “ I may restrict myself to pamphlets,’’ she said. Some candidates are relying on Facebook and WhatApp and others have launched a callin programme that announces the name of the candidate and the party symbol. Such campaigning will not be allowed on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp in the last 48 hours before polling, the voluntary code of ethics prepared by these platforms said. Social media companies will take action on content reported by the nodal officer in accordance with the law. Internet and Mobile Association of India will act as the liaison between the social media firms and the election commission. District election authorities have formed teams to monitor the social media campaign for violations of the poll code as well as the costs which the contestants will have to show as poll expenditure. They will have to declare the use of social media and any digression will mean a notice seeking an explanation. Electronic surveillance teams will keep a close watch on social media accounts of all the candidates and record violations, if any, the officials added. A candidate is allowed to spend up to Rs 28 lakh while parties do not have any ceiling. The returning officers will construct a strong room in every assembly segment for storing electronic voting machines and for counting of votes. Rates for lunch, snacks and pandals would be put in two categories — general and deluxe — and the candidates would be charged accordingly.

Maharashtra elections: Glass-fronted buildings show Jogeshwari East the mirror | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: After spending 50 years of his life in the dingy 100 sq ft shanties of Jogeshwari’s infamous ‘Bandra plot’— a dense slum pocket teeming with a population of thousands but no sanitation, roads, drainage or sunlight— Firoze Khan still hopes for a change in these sub-human conditions. A driver and father of two teenaged sons, he says, “Even we want to live in bigger homes near open spaces, where kids can play and adults have mornings walks.” Scarred for years due to its proximity to the bloodshed of the 1992-93 riots, residents of Hari Nagar, Amina Nagar, Goli Nagar within ‘Bandra plot’ say they are desperate to rid themselves of poor living conditions. As voting day draws near, residents of this area off Western Express Highway are eager to hear about solutions around redevelopment, sanitation and employment. Despite its violent past with the Shiv Sena, many are even willing to put their trust in sitting MLA Ravindra Waikar, also the state’s junior housing minister. The 60-year-old Sainik is aiming for a third consecutive win from Jogeshwari East. Waikar, a corporator four times before he became an MLA in 2009, is confident his work speaks for itself. “From the Jogeshwari of the 1990s that was synonymous with communal riots and crime, it’s transformed into a modern hub with good residential options as well as corporate spaces. My aim is to strengthen amenities over the next five years, including building a stadium,” he told TOI. In 2014, Waikar comfortably won the seat, polling over 72,000 votes and defeating BJP’s Ujwala Modak by nearly 28,000 votes. Owing to the Sena-BJP pact, Modak is not contesting this time. Both Congress and AAP have also fielded candidates who have worked on tribal issues. AAP candidate Vitthal Lad said he’s been working towards resolving issues of the tribal population in cities since 1983. “Little has changed in terms of housing or living conditions for them. Worse, Aarey is being encroached on, and often politicians are handin-glove with the encroachers,” he said. Jogeshwari East, with an electoral base of over 2.80 lakh, has fast transformed with slums and chawls from Majaswadi, Shyam Nagar and Meghwadi making way for plush towers. However, development has not been uniform for everyone, says Khan from ‘Bandra plot.’ “It has been over three years since the SRA project to redevelop our area was finalized, but nothing has been done except surveys,” he said. Also, locals say residential or commercial growth has not resulted in a simultaneous change in civic amenities and infrastructure. The arterial 10.6kmlong Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road has become a bane owing to traffic snarls. “The Development Plan speaks about creating two roads from Poonam Nagar and Mahakali to ease the inside traffic into JVLR and WEH, but no work has happened there,” said ALM member Ramesh Pai. Columnist Robert Clements, a Poonam Nagar resident, said any transformation is incomplete without upgradation. “We are blessed in terms of greenery and open spaces, but the area still doesn’t have a sewage system,” he said. Waikar claims every slum pocket in the ward has water, electricity and toilets, including areas populated by the Muslim community. “In the last election, I won at least 6,000 Muslim votes, and that number will grow,” he said. “No party is willing to field any candidate against me because they know I have worked hard,” he said.

Maharashtra politics: 50:50 formula - What BJP promised to Shiv Sena in February | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: BJP and one of its oldest alliance partners Shiv Sena are on a collision course once again. On this occasion it is over the chief minister's post in Maharashtra where BJP emerged as the single largest party winning 105 seats in the 288-member state assembly. Shiv Sena bagged 56 seats. From the very day the results were announced on October 24, Shiv Sena has been laying claim to the chief minister’s post. Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray and its senior leader Sanjay Raut have been reminding BJP of the “50:50 formula” which, they claim, was decided before the Lok Sabha election. Thackeray and Raut have gone on record to state that Maharashtra’s caretaker chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced the 50:50 formula in the presence of BJP president Amit Shah in a press conference held at Mumbai. However, a revisit to the video clip mentioned by Uddhav Thackeray and Sanjay Raut does not find any explicit reference to the 50:50 formula for the chief minister’s post.   भाजपा राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष श्री.अमित शहा जी यांची पत्रकार परिषद, मुंबई. त्यांच्या समवेत महाराष्ट्राचे मुख्यमंत्री श्री. देवेंद्र फडणवीस जी व शिवसेना अध्यक्ष श्री. उद्धव ठाकरे आणि प्रदेश अध्यक्ष श्री रावसाहेब दानवे पाटिल जी. . Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Amit Shah Devendra Fadnavis Raosaheb Patil DanvePosted by BJP Maharashtra on Monday, 18 February 2019 A joint press conference of BJP and Shiv Sena leaders was held on February 18 after the two parties entered into a seat-sharing arrangement for the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections. It was addressed by Devendra Fadnavis, Uddhav Thackeray and Amit Shah - in that order. In his address, Fadnavis first spoke in Marathi and then in Hindi. In his address, he said, “Today BJP and Shiv Sena have decided to come together once again in Maharashtra and at the national level. We have been together for the last 25 years.” Fadnavis admitted that due to some reasons the two parties could not remain allies in the 2014 assembly election. “Despite this, we ran the governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra as NDA partners,” he said. The then Maharashtra chief minister said there would have been differences between BJP and Shiv Sena over some issues. “However, both the parties are nationalists and follow Hindutva. At a time when attempts are being made to challenge the nationalist ideologies, it is quite natural that the nationalist parties join hands and accept the challenges in the interest of the nation and the society.” Towards that end, Fadnavis said, it was decided that BJP and Shiv Sena would contest the Lok Sabha and the (Maharashtra) assembly elections together. BJP would fight on 25 seats and Shiv Sena on 23 in the Lok Sabha election, he declared. Fadnavis further said, “In the assembly election, we (BJP and Shiv Sena) will contest on equal number of seats after excluding the seats of other alliance partners.” He said they were confident that the Narendra Modi-led NDA government would return to power “because of the extremely good work it has done in the last five years”. BJP, Shiv Sena and other alliance partners would also retain power in Maharashtra, he said. On the contentious issue of sharing power, which has become the bone of contention between BJP and Shiv Sena, Fadnavis said, “Aur ismein is sarkar ke aane ke baad pud aur zimmedaariyan ye samaan roop se iska nirvahan hum log karengey, ye bhi nirnay humne yahaan par liya hua hai. (It has also been decided that once we come back to power, we will equally share the responsibilities and posts).” On October 29, Fadnavis reiterated that BJP had never promised the CM's post for two-and-a-half years to Shiv Sena when the alliance was sealed before the 2019 Lok Sabha election. “The Shiv Sena was not promised CM's post for two-and-a-half years when the alliance was formalised before the Lok Sabha polls,"" he told mediapersons at his official residence 'Varsha' at Mumbai.

Maharashtra in poor health: Message to parties | Pune News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Social health activists on Tuesday released a ‘health manifesto’ for political parties ahead of the assembly election on October 21, underscoring the point that Maharashtra, home to most of the country’s dollar billionaires, also leads in farmer suicides and malnutrition deaths. “States like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are in the process of drafting a right to healthcare act and we want Maharashtra to do the same. It is the people’s right to demand healthcare and government’s job to ensure it has adequate staff to deliver healthcare,’’ said Dr Abhay Shukla, co-convenor of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan that organised Tuesday’s meet. Over 200 social health activists including from Nandurbar, Parbhani, Sangli, attended it. The meeting highlighted the “shocking contrasts’’ in Maharashtra. Of the 3 lakh farmer suicides registered across India since 1995, around 60,000 are from Maharashtra, which has also seen 70,000 deaths due to malnutrition. The abysmal statistics are mainly due to poor health expenditure by the state. “A progressive state such as Maharashtra spends only Rs 975 per person per year on public health as compared to the national average of Rs 1,563,’’ said health economist Dr Ravi Duggal. He added that only three states–West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar–were worse on per capita health expenditure. “States such as Kerala spend almost double the national average,’’ he added. The experts also raised the government’s refusal to implement the Clinical Establishment Act six years after the draft was prepared. Availability of essential medicines in the public health system was another area of concern. The state has a critical shortage of staff in its public health system. “There are 17,000 vacant health posts in rural areas and another 9,000 in urban areas,’’ said Shankar Pujari of the Maharashtra ASHA workers and health employee’s organization. He said ASHAs perform 73 health tasks but are paid Rs 4000. “Wherever there is a shortage of nurses or other healthcare workers, the ASHAs are asked to pitch in without any money,’’ he alleged. The key demands in the manifesto include hikee in expenditure, strengthening of public health systems and policies for human resources. “Our manifesto calls on government to strengthen and expand the public health system,'' added Dr Shukla.

Mumbai: All polling stations to be on ground floor if there’s no lift | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: For the first time an assembly election will have all polling booths on the ground floor if the building does not have working lifts. Taxis and buses will also be arranged by the election commission to ferry the elderly, ailing or disabled voters. “Accessibility will be the main feature of this election and the administration is braced to achieve it,” city district collector Shivaji Jondhale and suburban collector Milind Borikar, who are also the district election officers, said in a public interaction organised by Together VCAN, a social forum. Farog Mukadam, deputy election officer, said the city and suburbs had 2,540 and 7,395 polling stations and only 104 of these in the city and 450 in the suburbs had permission to operate from the first, second and third floors as these had functional lifts. There would also be ramps for voters moving on wheel-chairs. While city has around 5.5 lakh voters above the age of 60, the suburban district has approximately over 20 lakh senior citizens. The collectors said that at stations where rooms were not available on the ground floor, pandals would be erected to create polling booths. There are around 2,600 persons with disabilities in the city district and around 5,500 in the suburban district. The city and suburbs have a target of achieving a minimum of 60% voting against the 53% and 57% achieved in the recent Lok Sabha polls. “We have around 14 wheelchair-mounted vehicles donated by VCAN, a social forum and six buses in the city to cater to disabled and elderly voters. In the suburbs, around 100 buses will arrange transport for them. Over and above this, 360 and 1,200 taxis each in city and suburbs will help in arranging transport for such voters on behalf of the election commission,” Mukadam said.

Congress Maharashtra chief targets Devendra Fadnavis over flood relief | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Congress state unit president Balasaheb Thorat on Wednesday played down party leader Rahul Gandhi’s absence in the poll campaign. “Travelling abroad is no big a deal these days.

Thorat, at a presser in Pune, attacked the BJP on various fronts.  “Despite being in power at the Centre, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis could not fetch a single penny for relief to the flood-affected people in Maharashtra. Instead, he on a Vidarbha tour when people were battling floods in other parts of the state,” he said. The state government had sent a proposal to the Union government seeking Rs 6,800 crore as flood relief, but not a penny has been received, he said. Kolhapur and Sangli districts were badly hit. Thorat listed development issues in Pune city and claimed that the state government has ‘miserably failed’ in tackling them. “Pune city's development has worsened in the last five years especially drinking water, traffic and garbage disposal issues,” he said. “Smart city and all the announcements surrounding it are hollow.

""Earlier, VAT was charged when the product was sold. With GST, we pay 18% tax at the time of purchase, so our capital gets blocked."" Spice exporter Chandresh Sampat from Navi Mumbai is also feeling the heat and claims his business is down 30%. ""Our products are not competitively priced because of high taxation. The GST refunds take six months to arrive."" GST has made bills mandatory and traders who operated without bills and evaded taxes can no longer do so. Many can't stomach the fall in their profits.  Despite the financial hit, large sections of the trader community - dominated by Gujaratis and Marwaris - still back the BJP. They feel the BJP-led government will deliver in the long run, after the initial setbacks. For them, Prime Minister Modi retains his halo despite demonetisation and the hasty implementation of GST. ""The government is doing shuddhikaran and is working hard but luck is eluding it,"" rationalises Ghatkopar resident Mukund Merchant. ""Finally, they will set things right,"" he feels. For many, the scrapping of Article 370 in Kashmir has touched a chord and nationalistic fervour overrides business woes. ""We have faith Modi will manage. He is a decisive leader. See how he dealt with Article 370,"" says Kumar Jain from Shree Jewellers' Association, whose business has been crippled by the high import duty on gold and the crash of the rupee.  The push for infrastructure is a positive with this urban community. ""The government is building the Metro and bridges. It deserves another chance,"" says jeweller Prakash Choudhuri.  Some argue Modi can't be blamed for the slowdown. ""The government is undertaking digitisation of economy and, hence, there is a slowdown. Also, the China-US trade war is affecting trade. The government is not to be blamed,"" says Shailesh Shah, director of Jabs International, a spice firm in Mahape.  Sceptics like Mahesh Jain, who has a spare parts business in Fort, are few. He remains a BJP supporter but disapproves of its approach.  ""The government is insisting on banking transactions which are making operations of small traders impossible. All cash transactions are not black and all banking money is not white money. After all, thousands of crores have been siphoned out of India using the banking route,"" he says.

Maharashtra assembly elections: BJP and Shiv Sena lock horns over five seats | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Although the BJP state president claimed that alliance talks with the Shiv Sena are in their final stage, sources said both parties had locked horns over five seats. Insiders said Wadala, Airoli, Belapur, Ulhasnagar and Ausa in Latur, all held by the Shiv Sena so far, were the five seats in question and these were proving to be a major challenge in alliance talks. The BJP wants to contest from these assembly seats. On Tuesday, BJP state president Chandrakant Patil had said that chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena party president Uddhav Thackeray were discussing the seat-sharing formula, but Shiv Sena politicians said that the seat-sharing formula had been decided even before the Lok Sabha election and that it had to be equal seats for both parties. One of the most senior MLAs in the state assembly, Kalidas Kolambkar, who has represented Wadala (known as Naigaon before delimitation) seven times, recently switched over to the BJP from the Congress. Kolambkar defeated Mihir Kotecha of the BJP in 2014. The constituency was with the Sena in 2009, when the saffron parties fought as an alliance. Earlier, Kolambkar represented the constituency as Shiv Sena MLA for four terms from 1990 to 2004. In Belapur and Airoli, both in Navi Mumbai, Ganesh Naik’s family holds sway. Naik recently joined the BJP. In Ulhasnagar, former BJP MLA Kumar Ailani lost against Jyoti Kalani of the NCP in 2014. Kalani is said to have been refused an NCP ticket and may switch to the BJP or Shiv Sena. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra assembly polls: BJP may field 4 new faces in Pune, Patil likely from Kothrud | Maharashtra Election News - Times of India","PUNE: The strong likelihood of the BJP fielding its state unit chief and revenue minister Chandrakant Patil from the Kothrud constituency here has set off sparks with its alliance partner Shiv Sena and some Brahmin outfits. Patil announced in Mumbai on Monday that he would contest the assembly elections though he did not say from where. But speculation has been strong for some time now that he would be offered Kothrud. Besides Kothrud, the BJP is also likely to field new candidates from three other assembly constituencies in Pune. Shivajinagar MLA Vijay Kale is likely to be replaced by corporator Siddharth Shirole, son of former MP Anil Shirole; Pune Cantonment MLA Dilip Kamble may lose the nomination to his younger brother Sunil, present chairman of the PMC's standing committee; and, mayor Mukta Tilak is likely to be fielded from Kasba Peth, which has been vacant since Girish Bapat won the LS election. Madhuri Misal (Parvati), Bhimrao Tapkir (Khadakwasla), Jagdish Mulik (Wadgaonsheri) and Yogesh Tilekar (Hadapsar) might be re-nominated. BJP insiders said Patil would merely be following the decision of the top brass in Delhi. In fact, Patil would always describe himself as an “envelope without address”, indicating he would go wherever the party wanted him to. Party sources said PM Modi and Amit Shah are keen on Patil becoming a member of the new House in the state and, therefore, have decided to field him from Kothrud, considered the strongest bastion of the BJP in western Maharashtra. No sooner was it known that Patil would be the party’s likely choice from Kothrud than banners opposing him went up in some parts of the constituency which read that the candidate should be a local person, not an outsider. Hailing from Kolhapur, Patil has never fought a state assembly election. He has been an MLC from the Pune graduates’ constituency since 2008 and his term ends in June next year. He is considered only next to the chief minister in the state cabinet. Chandrakant Mokate, former Sena MLA from the constituency, may rebel if Patil gets the ticket. Some groups from the Brahmin community, which dominates the constituency, have also opposed Patil’s possible candidature. Mokate had contested the assembly elections from Kothrud in 2014 but lost to BJP’s Medha Kulkarni. Patil was, in fact, exploring three constituencies in Kolhapur district — Kolhapur north, Chandgad and Radhanagari — but all are currently with the Sena. The Sena is unwilling to give up any of these seats. Moreover, contesting from Kolhapur would mean farmers' leader Raju Shetti would stand against him. Shetti is not inclined to fight Patil in an urban constituency like Kothrud. Parshuram Seva Sangh, a Brahmin outfit in Pune, has opposed any move to field Patil from Kothrud, saying the constituency was one of the few which give representation to the community. “Current MLA Medha Kulkarni could get elected from Kothrud in 2014 due to the community’s support. Even during the recent Lok Sabha elections, the Kothrud assembly segment gave party candidate Girish Bapat a lead of around 1 lakh votes,” said Vishwajit Deshpande of the outfit. Anand Dave of the Brahman Mahasangh said, ""We will not be happy if the BJP fields a person who has not done justice to issues regarding our community, like the Dadoji Konddeo and Ram Ganesh Gadkari statues. Patil also had a role in displacing Brahmins from the Kolhapur temple. He also did not entertain our issues regarding the community."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."
"Maharashtra assembly elections: MNS likely to contest 120 seats in MMR, Pune, Marathwada | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The MNS led by Raj Thackeray, earlier reluctant to enter the polls, has tossed its hat in the ring and might field 120 candidates. The party chief may take an active part in the election process and hold campaign rallies.

NDA will score over 220: BJP Maharashtra president | Pune News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: BJP state president Chandrakant Patil on Tuesday affirmed the NDA in the state would win over 220 of the 288 seats in the October assembly elections. The BJP is yet to formalise its alliance with the Shiv Sena. In the last assembly election the two parties contested separately and after the election formed an alliance to form the government. BJP national president Amit Shah is expected in the city on Thursday to finalise the alliance. Addressing a press conference at the party state headquarters in the city, Patil said the chief minister's month-long Mahajanadesh Yatra drew tremendous response from the people of the state, especially women and the Muslim community. During the yatra CM Devendra Fadnavis addressed over 160 public rallies where he gave an account of government performance in the past five years, said Patil. In the run up to the assembly election, the party will hold training camps for 20,000 of its senior members from September 26 to October 10.

"Aaditya is new to politics, CMship can wait: Uddhav Thackeray | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Uddhav Thackeray on Monday set at rest speculation that the Shiv Sena will stake a claim to deputy chief ministership for Aaditya Thackeray. “Aaditya has just entered politics. This doesn’t mean that he will become chief minister or deputy chief minister. One will have to wait. This is his first election. Just wait for some time,” Uddhav told Saamna in the first instalment of a three-part interview. Saamna executive editor Sanjay Raut, MP, helmed the Q&A session with the Sena president. Inquiries revealed that the BJP has made it clear to the Sena that Aaditya will not be given the deputy CM’s post as it is not in keeping with the party’s (BJP) principles of governance and administration. Aaditya is the Sena candidate from the Worli assembly constituency. Uddhav bats for 'Sena CM'; BJP says no harm in expressing desireIn reply to a question, Thackeray said he will continue to make persistent efforts to instal a Sena chief minister in Mantralaya, sooner or later. “I have given a word to Balasaheb (Thackeray) that a Shiv Sainik will occupy the state’s CMship. I will not rest till I redeem my promise to my guru, my father, my leader,” he said. Thackeray’s vow was aimed at pacifying Shiv Sainiks who are said to be hurt by the BJP’s gameplan to impinge on Sena’s space by curtailing its tally of seats, said political analysts. Shiv Sainik would one day become Maharashtra CM: Uddhav ThackerayA Sena chief minister in the current political scenario appears unlikely as the BJP, which is contesting 164 seats, is expected to gain an upper hand on the Sena when the number game sets into motion after the state assembly elections, they added. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah have backed Fadnavis for a second term as CM. Thackeray was at pains to explain to Saamna why the Sena had accepted fewer seats from BJP. “Both (chief minister) Devendra-ji (Fadnavis) and (Maharashtra BJP president) Chandrakanti-ji (Patil) told me that I should understand their party’s difficulty in the distribution of seats. Hence, I agreed to accept 124 seats,” said Thackeray. Claiming that the seat-sharing formula was not a climbdown for the Sena, Thackeray said, “Although the Sena’s final tally seems less, 124 will mark the beginning of a new trend for the party. The Sena, with less number of seats, will win far more seats.” Thackeray claimed that he had entered into a compromise with the BJP in the larger interest of Maharashtra. However, in the course of the interview, he added that he was keen on acquiring “satta” (power) for the Sena. “If I have power, then I can give something to Shiv Sainiks in the 164 constituencies where the BJP is contesting the assembly election,” he said. Uddhav recalled the late Balasaheb’s advice to him that one should remain calm when a storm hits the shore. “Amidst storm, I will deepen the Sena’s roots in Maharashtra when other political parties are being blown away,” he added, likening BJP’s widespread acceptance to a furious storm.

"JP Nadda says Article 370, tax reforms to be BJP poll planks in Maharashtra | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: The BJP’s working president J P Nadda on Monday launched the party’s election campaign in the city and made it clear that its key planks across Maharashtra would be the revocation of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status, tax reforms and a corruption-free state government. “Maharashtra’s image was tarnished because of the corrupt practices of the previous leaders, who could not provide a stable government. The chief minister’s post was reduced to a musical chair and the leaders were fighting to secure it,” he said, while addressing a rally of BJP workers and booth leaders under the banner of the “Vijay Sankalp Melava”. Nadda said the Centre’s decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir would be a reason for citizens to cheer. He said: “Not only people in Maharashtra, but also those living in other parts of country are welcoming the move. The delimitation of the state will be done in way to make governance and the Assembly more inclusive. The tribal regions and castes from J&K will get representation in the Assembly.” Nadda also accused the parties now in the Opposition of misusing power when they had it. He said: “All that led to their decline. Most of the leaders in the Opposition parties are either in jail or out on bail now.” Nadda said BJP was the “only party in the country with a democratic structure,” where people could get plump posts “without having to market their caste or creed”. He said: “The decision making process in the BJP is based on a consensus. Other parties are ‘family parties’ and their members run the show.” The BJP leaders said they have designed a 9-point agenda for the Maharashtra elections and would organize a campaign between September 25 and October 2.

Maratha-fied BJP hopes to upend poll calculus | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: The BJP’s decision to import several Maratha leaders, including those with a tainted past, has not gone down well with its hardcore workers as it is altering the character, and face, of the party in Maharashtra. Several BJP sympathizers, particularly those with roots in the Sangh Parivar, have been questioning why the party has rolled out the red carpet for those who have criticized the Sangh’s ideology for most of their careers. Even the BJP has consistently targeted these leaders in the past on grounds of alleged corruption or neglect of public interest, BJP sympathizers say. The influx began with the Vikhe-Patils of Ahmednagar, and they have been followed by the Nimbalkars from Phaltan, the Mohite-Patils from Akluj, Rana Jagjitsinh Patil from Osmanabad, Harshvardhan Patil from Indapur and others, most notably three descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji: Sambhaji Raje Bhosale, Shivendra Raje and Udayan Raje. Most of these Maratha leaders from North and Western Maharashtra hold sway not just over their assembly segments but also over the cooperative sector, considered the political nerve-centre of these regions. While admitting that induction of these leaders is expected to improve the party’s prospects in the October 21 assembly polls, many BJP sympathizers told this paper that CM Devendra Fadnavis and state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil seemed to have gone into an overdrive to recruit these satraps. According to BJP insiders who are part of the strategizing team, however, the inductions are aimed not just at increasing the party’s tally in the coming polls. The longer-term strategy is to neutralize any attempts by the Congress and NCP to whip up anti-Brahmin sentiments to score over the BJP, which was for long labelled as a “Brahmin-Bania” party. The BJP has been trying to shed its upper-caste image since the early 1980s, but for a long time, the emphasis was on grooming non-Brahmin leaders such as Gopinath Munde, Pandurang Phundkar, Eknath Khadse and others from within the organization. Hence the makeover process was slow, and it got a jolt due to the untimely death of Munde and Phundkar. According to BJP insiders, the party leadership thought it fit to hasten the image makeover by inducting leaders from other parties. The issue gained priority for two reasons: CM Fadnavis is a Brahmin, and so are two Union ministers from the state — Nitin Gadkari and Prakash Javdekar. Also, Maharashtra has had a long tradition of resisting Brahmin hegemony in the literary, cultural and political sphere. The state has witnessed literary and social movements, including the ‘Vidrohi Sahitya chalwal’ and the ‘Brahmnetar chalwal,’ both of which challenged Brahmin dominance. And history shows these movements have helped consolidate the vote of the majority community – the Marathas at nearly 30% — in the state. “We learnt our lesson in 2004 post the James Laine book controversy and the attack on the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. We saw how our opponents consolidated Maratha and OBC votes following the controversy,” a senior BJP strategist said. Laine’s book on Shivaji was banned for allegedly being derogatory. For the 2014 assembly polls, the BJP put up the image of Chhatrapati Shivaji on its posters. The slogan it raised then was: “Shivchhatrapati ka ashirwad, chalo chale Modi ke saath.” In 2016, though Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was invited to accompany PM Modi for the “jal pujan” ceremony of the Shivaji memorial in Mumbai, many in the Sena felt the BJP was trying to “hijack” their icon. After 2015, the process of ‘Marathafication’ was accelerated given the support within the community for the quota demand. Efforts by the opposition to fan sentiments of the community over the issue and channelize those against the state government were nipped in the bud. The party swiftly picked Sambhaji Raje Chhatrapati, descendant of Shivaji and great-grandson of Chhatrapati Shahu of Kolhapur, as the President’s nominee to the Rajya Sabha. Though NCP chief Sharad Pawar sarcastically said the BJP was scripting a new era where “a Fadnavis was appointing a Chhatrapati,” it did not fuel anti-BJP sentiments. Sambhaji Raje, at the forefront of the quota agitation, showered praises on Fadnavis and BJP for fulfilling the majority community’s demand after the quota legislation was upheld by the Bombay high court. The recent entry of two other Shivaji descendants, Satara MLA Shivendra Raje Bhosale and Satara MP Udayan Raje has jolted NCP and ensured the entire family is on BJP’s side. This drive to win over Marathas and leaders from other communities such as Ganesh Naik, an agri leader, has come at the cost of sidelining some of BJP’s own loyal Maratha and OBC leaders whom the party had groomed over the years. Many in the BJP are apprehensive the strategy may prove counterproductive in the long run. They fear these “opportunistic leaders” will desert BJP if and when the wind blows in the opposite direction and their presence in the BJP will erode the party’s “value system nurtured by the RSS.” “Fadnavis has a special washing powder to clean the ‘sins’ of these leaders who are joining BJP for selfish reasons,” BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who has been sidetracked within the party, said sardonically at a recent function. BJP strategists say the BJP supporters’s concerns are not unwarranted, but the Maratha leadership publicly embracing “Hindutva politics” is in itself a big gain for BJP as it will help it penetrate into areas under Congress-NCP’s domain for decades.

"Malabar Hill seeks better parking, traffic, footpaths | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The state assembly constituency of Malabar Hill is not just about First World problems. Over the last few months, this fancy high heel of the city, home to industrialist Mukesh Ambani, singer Lata Mangeshkar, the governor, the chief minister and other VIPs, has been bothered by not only the coastal road project and its reclamation of land but also everyman civic issues such as the hefty parking fines levied by the BMC, congested roads, illegal dumping of debris, incessant redevelopment and other common side-effects of works in progress. While upmarket residents here readily agree that many of these niggling municipal issues are probably too petty to be addressed by the state, activists think the fact that infrastructural projects affect the elite Altamont Road and Pedder Road residents as well as the middle-class occupants of Tardeo and Girgaum magnifies their gravity in the run-up to the Vidhan Sabha election and warrants attention at the policy level. “Irrespective of the representative who wins, the MLA funds must be used optimally and utilised in an equitable manner for upliftment of all areas in the constituency,” ” says Indrani Malkani, a Malabar Hill resident and chairman of the non-profit V Citizens Action Network. On the map, the Malabar Hill Vidhan Sabha constituency looks roughly like a leaping beast divided into 38 zones. Its head starts from the sea south of Haji Ali dargah, intestines run along the Western Railway tracks up to Grant Road, and hind legs reach the Mata Parvati Nagar slum near Teen Batti. Since 1995, the lotus has floated steady in this BJP stronghold that has many Gujarati and Marwari business tycoons apart from Maharashtrians, Parsis and Christians. The BJP candidate is the Jaguar-owning Mangal Prabhat Lodha (63), who recently declared assets worth Rs 441 crore in his poll affidavit. He won the 2014 assembly election for the fifth consecutive time by a large margin and is now seeking a sixth term. His main contest is against Heera Devasi (43) of the Congress. Lodha’s manifesto has his idea of a business-friendly city free of Licence Raj, a new link road from Nariman Point to Worli in five years to help decongest Malabar Hill roads, and ensuring at least five new ICSE schools in the area. Among his key achievements, he lists the introduction of the right to information law in 1997 and facilities such as mobile health clinics. “What we want is someone who can represent us and dialogue more with us. What we don’t want is the coastal road,” says architect and urban planner Rahul Kadri of Nepean Sea Road Citizens Forum (NSRCF), who not only leads a campaign against the reclamation of land from the sea under the Rs 14,000-crore-plus coastal project but is also worried about the population explosion caused by haphazard urban development. FSI policies and the redevelopment of cessed buildings eed reviewing at the state level, in his opinion. Parking, traffic and footpaths are the whiny key-words that bind voters across the socio-economic spectrum from Malabar Hill to Khetwadi. Manisha Shah, who runs a travel agency in Prarthana Samaj that operates 19 school buses in the area, recalls a function where a local politician promised to rebuild the Marine Lines railway station foot-overbridge razed in March. “It has been several months now and there is no sign of the bridge,” says Shah, adding that the resulting congestion invariably delay her buses. Shah, who wishes for a road decongestion policy, is also not a fan of the new BMC parking regulations that made her decide to sell off her car recently. Old buildings in places such as Nepean Sea Road do not have parking space, say residents. Jignesh, a Khetwadi resident, complains the fines are too heavy at Rs 5,000 for two-wheelers and Rs 10,000 for cars, Yogendra Vora of Pedder Road Residents Association, says the no-parking should have been restricted to main roads. Many praise the reduction in BEST ticket fares but lament the lack of frequency in areas such as Nepean Sea Road, which also wishes to have been linked to the Metro III. “Traffic has worsened with festivals around the corner,” says Vora, adding that the footpaths are being eaten up by road-widening. Though open spaces such as Hanging Gardens and Priyadarshini Park means that voters breathe well, some do feel the area’s tourism potential can be exploited better. The constituency registered a 56% voter turnout, higher than the south Mumbai average of 52.15%, in the Lok Sabha election this year, but there are people who complain about election-enabling infrastructure. “Getting to the electoral booth at Pedder Road’s Villa Theresa School involves a steep climb and is extremely difficult, especially for senior citizens,” says a resident who has complained to the authorities often in vain. Many lavish praise on the sitting MLA and find him accessible, yet cynicism rides high too. If Sheetal Khilnani of Walkeshwar says politicians are only interested in “lining their pockets”, Madhu Gohil, a resident of Tardeo who works in a printing press, has stopped expecting improvements. “Corruption is not going to leave the system,” says Gohil, whose reality includes dug-up roads, the nuisance of relentless construction behind the AC market and footpaths at Janta Nagar that get water-logged after recent raising of roads. “Nobody cares about the common man,” says Gohil, who says he will vote in the election nonetheless.

Satara Lok Sabha bypoll on October 21 | Kolhapur News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday unexpectedly announced a bye-election in the Satara Lok Sabha constituency. Earlier, when the plan for state assembly polls was declared, chief election commissioner Sunil Arora had not commented on the question of the bye-election plan. The bypoll has been necessitated by the resignation of NCP member Udayanraje Bhosale, who went on to join the BJP. While notification for bypoll will be issued on September 27, polling will be held on October 21 and counting on October 24. Bhosale, who has been elected to the Lok Sabha from Satara for three consecutive terms, quit the NCP and joined the BJP at a rally in Nashik on September 19. The BJP and Shiv Sena had agreed to allot Satara to the Sena, but now the BJP will have to exchange the seat with the Sena. In the 2014 LS election, Bhosale had defeated Shiv Sena nominee Narendra Patil by over 1.2 lakh votes.

Maharashtra: Opposition cites government note to allege corruption in Shivaji statue contract | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Alleging corruption, Congress and NCP on Tuesday asked CM Devendra Fadnavis to scrap the 3,600 crore tender for construction of the Shivaji Maharaj memorial and order a judicial probe into the manner in which norms laid down by Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) were violated. The state has proposed a Shivaji memorial on land admeasuring nearly 16 hectares in the Arabian sea. ""All along, the CM had claimed his government was clean and transparent even though two cabinet members were sacked and 21 others were facing charges of corruption. We have studied documents pertaining to allotment of contract and have reasons to believe the government did not spare even the Shivaji memorial for indulging in corrupt practices. We demand the tender be scrapped,"" NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik and his Congress counterpart Sachin Sawant alleged. Congress and NCP activists procured documents of the contract awarded to a leading construction firm, along with objections raised by the senior divisional accounts officer under RTI and released them to the media. Sawant submitted that the project's original cost was 3,800 crore, and after renegotiation it was lowered to 2,500 crore.""Since the basic conditions in the tender were changed, it was beyond the powers of the public works department to award the contract,"" Sawant said. As per CVC norms, if the structure of a tender is changed, the only option is to call for fresh tenders,"" Sawant said. Sawant said the officer submitted a note saying negotiation on the tendered rate is prohibited by CVC. Further, scope of work too had changed, which again violated CVC orders. ""As public interest litigations are pending before the high court challenging the project, the contract should be awarded after disposal of PILs by the court,"" the officer said in his note. The Cong-NCP leaders said the accounts officer had also said cost reduction through negotiation may result in sub-standard work, and any reduction in scope of work may have an adverse impact on the project.

Ajit Pawar’s claim on Parvati seat for NCP troubles Congress heads | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar’s announcement on Sunday staking claim to the Parvati assembly seat in Pune has ruffled the feathers of Congress leaders who now want senior leaders to intervene. Pawar had said his party would contest from four seats in Pune city, including Parvati. In Pimpri Chinchwad, he said the NCP would contest from all three of its segments — Pimpri, Chinchwad and Bhosari The Congress’s senior corporator and former deputy mayor Aba Bagul and local leader Sachin Tawre who recently joined the Congress have a significant following in the Parvati constituency, and city unit chief Ramesh Bagwe had won the seat in 2004. A senior Congress leader from Mumbai on Monday said their leaders in Pune were not aware of any seat-sharing formula for Pune. “We are not contesting Pawar’s claim, but the seat-sharing announcement should be done jointly by leaders of both the parties to avoid misunderstandings,” he said. Bagwe said the Congress’s claim on the Parvati segment was intact. “We have a strong base in Parvati. The seat sharing between the Congress and the NCP for the state has not been announced as yet. We are looking forward to contesting from Parvati with the NCP’s support,” Bagwe added. Bagul, who is keen on contesting on a Congress ticket, said the party should decide the candidature based on the aspirant’s work and reach. “I have been working in the constituency for three decades and now want to expand my work.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: Congress, NCP leaders unsure of tickets test waters with VBA | Kolhapur News - Times of India","KOLHAPUR: The Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) is set to emerge as an option for ambitious political leaders who may be denied nomination from the Congress or NCP. Sources in the VBA said several leaders, particularly from these two parties, have been in touch with Ambedkar and have shown willingness to contest on the party ticket. VBA had made an impact on the political scenario during the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, garnering over 1 lakh votes in at least 11 seats. Prakash Awade, senior leader from Ichalkaranji, had a half-an-hour closed-door meeting with Ambedkar on Sunday. Awade recently resigned from the Congress saying he was not happy with the party’s stand on the abrogation of Article 370 and 35(A). He was district Congress committee president when he resigned from the party. Awade refused to comment after his meeting with Ambedkar. He, however, admitted that he had discussed the current political situation with the VBA chief. “I am not with any political party now and can meet anybody. Ambedkar is a senior leader and I met him,” he told TOI, adding that he would contest from Ichalkaranji and would also field two candidates in Kolhapur district. VBA sources said a few leaders in Solapur, Kolhapur and Sangli districts have already had preliminary talks with the party. A section of leaders from Marathwada is also in touch with VBA leaders as they feel the socio-economic background of the region is more favourable for the party’s social engineering experiment. Ambedkar has made it clear that the VBA would not support independents and that leaders would have to join his party. VBA sources said the party is keen on expanding its base and would not entertain independents. “Influential leaders can join the party and ask for a ticket if they believe in our agenda. They will have to fight on the party symbol,” a VBA leader said. The VBA has taken this stand as it fears independent MLAs cannot be controlled. The sources said the VBA has chalked out a certain policy to decide upon its candidates and would give priority to members of the other backward classes and the Muslim community. They said 25 Muslim candidates have been finalized for the polls and their names would be announced at the right time. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"By dropping four netas, BJP brings Mahajan-Munde era to an end | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: By denying party nominations to Vinod Tawde, Eknath Khadse, Prakash Mehta and Raj Purohit for the assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has brought the curtain down on the Pramod Mahajan-Gopinath Munde era, which saw the rise of the quartet in the 1990s, said political analysts. Tawde and Khadse came into their own in 1995 when the BJP teamed up with the Shiv Sena to form the saffron government in the state. Ditto with Mehta and Purohit. Mehta was inducted in the Manohar Joshi regime to win over the Gujarati community. Kirit Somaiya too played a key role in consolidating the BJP’s base among the city’s traders, said a party worker from Mulund. Somaiya was denied the Lok Sabha nomination from Mumbai North-East earlier this year. When the Sena-BJP lost the 1999 state elections, Khadse and Tawde joined Munde to do some brilliant sabrerattling on the floor of the state legislature and keep the ruling Congress-NCP combine on a tight leash, said Vidhan Bhavan observers. “The BJP bigwigs have, in one fell swoop, cut to size an entire team of functionaries who helped the party strike deep roots in Mumbai in the 1990s,” said a former party MLA. Eknath Khadse, he added, has for long been the BJP’s poster boy in northern Maharashtra. The CM is said to be deeply embarrassed by the turn of events as he, sources close to him said, tried to persuade the BJP central Parliamentary board to take a lenient stand on the issue, but apparently to no avail. Tawde’s aggressive style of functioning and Mehta’s alleged role in the allotment of a Tardeo slum project, which kicked up an unsavoury row, have cost them their seats, it is learnt. The party has turned the quartet into an example to be held up before legislators to keep them under control, sources said. The BJP high command on Friday released the fourth -- and final -- list of Maharashtra poll candidates without the names of the four party seniors. In keeping with the protocol, Tawde, being a cabinet minister, should have made it to the very first list, sources added. “Tawde is a hard nut to crack. He has a mind of his own and wouldn’t let anyone get into his hair. His aggressive style of functioning didn’t go down well with the party bosses in New Delhi,” said a state BJP functionary. Fadnavis had deputed a senior BJP minister to make Tawde see reason even as the party high command kept close tabs on the latter’s functioning, he said, adding, “But Tawde made light of the senior minister’s warning.” A section in the city BJP thinks that the party high command has been unduly harsh on the foursome. “We are told that Mehta has been denied a ticket because of several irregularities in the Tardeo slum project. But look at the track record of many of the defectors who have joined the BJP. Most of them face cases of corruption, and they want immunity from the law and a seat in the state assembly as well,” said a former party MLA.

"‘MIM not responsible for lack of opposition unity, it’s Congress that’s failed to keep its house in order’ | Pune News - Times of India","MIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi has articulated several issues concerning minorities, inside Parliament and outside it. His splitting from the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) has surprised many. Blaming the Congress-NCP for the absence of a united opposition front in Maharashtra, Owaisi has urged his community not to put all their eggs in the basket of one party but to explore alternative ways to end their political marginalisation. Excerpts from an interview he gave TOI: Q: Will the disunity in the opposition camp help the BJP-Sena alliance to return to power in the state? Why is the opposition in disarray?A: You should put this question to the Congress-NCP combine. If the former city president of Congress (Sanjay Nirupam) says he has been ignored and feels like quitting the party, the Congress has a lot to answer for, for failing to keep its house in order. There is an exodus from Congress and NCP to BJP and Sena. The opposition disunity is not because of me, but because of the party which ruled for over sixty years. Q: The MIM-VBA alliance had performed well at the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year. Then what caused you to split from the VBA?A: We tried our best to keep the alliance with VBA intact, and I have great respect for VBA president Prakashji (Ambedkar), but unfortunately, we couldn’t agree on certain things, and the alliance broke. Out of 52 seats we are contesting, on over half a dozen we have nominated Dalits and OBCs. Q: Is there an unofficial alliance between the MIM and Samajwadi Party? The SP candidate from Byculla shifted to Bhiwandi East, making it easier for your candidate, sitting MLA Waris Pathan.A: Waris Pathan has worked a lot in the area, and he will win again. We have no alliance with the SP, but I must say that the secular parties should not damage each other. Q: BJP leader and Union home minister Amit Shah has made revocation of Article 370 the major poll issue in Maharashtra. Your response?A: Between 2014 and 2018, 14,000 farmers have committed suicide in Maharashtra. Unemployment has gone up by 6% and there is substantial decline in industrial output in the state. Yet for the BJP, Article 370 is the main issue because they have failed on all other fronts. Q: Amit Shah has reiterated that the NRC will be brought in the entire country after the Citizenship Amendment Bill is passed.A: Religion cannot be the basis for citizenship in India. Unlike Pakistan, we are not a theocratic country. Our Constitution gives equal rights to all citizens, even those who don’t follow any religion. By brining the Citizenship Amendment Bill, we will be only proving Jinnah’s two-nation theory right. Q: What do you have to say about a member of the Thackeray family, Aaditya, fighting an election for the first time?A: What can I say? NowSena will not be run by a remote control.
