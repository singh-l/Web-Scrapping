 Plea in Delhi HC seeks to stop entry of J&amp;K MPs in Parliament | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A petition was filed in Delhi high court seeking direction to stop the entry of the MPs from the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in the Parliament, contending they lost their locus standi after the bifurcation of the state into two union territories. According to the petitioner, on August 5, 2019, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was disbanded and in its place, two Union Territories were formed, therefore the MPs representing the State in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha lost their locus standi to sit in the Indian Parliament. The plea, filed by one professor from Jammu and Kashmir, Abdul Gani Bhat, who has sought the 10 Members of Parliament from the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state should be stopped from entering and occupying seats in the Indian parliament forthwith. The petitioner, in his plea, said that MPs are representatives of the people of their States or Union territories. ""But when there is no State or Union territory there cannot be any representation of that non-existent State or Union territory in the Indian Parliament. On 5th August 2019, the State of J&K was disbanded and in its place, two Union territories were formed. Accordingly, the MPs representing the State in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha lost their locus standi to sit in the Indian Parliament,"" the petitioner said. He further added that their continuation in the Parliament is illegal and unconstitutional for all practical purposes. The petitioner said that Parliament of India abrogated the temporary Article 370 of the Constitution of India, canceled separate constitutions, separate flag, separate laws and separate status of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and reorganised the State into two Union territories of Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. He further added that the four Rajya Sabha members and six Lok Sabha members from the erstwhile State continued holding their seats in the Indian Parliament, unabashedly, illegally and immorally, even after the August 5, 2019, when the State of J&K ceased to exist, and continued drawing on the Union public Exchequer and enjoying facilities and perks, without any right, logic or reason, which is a total lossand total drain of the Union Public exchequer. ""Thus the presence of the 10 members in the Indian parliament from the erstwhile State is immoral, illegal and unconstitutional,"" the petition said.

 Hope ‘sabka...’ motto guides CAA: UK | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Outgoing British high commissioner Dominic Asquith Thursday expressed hope the Indian government will continue to address the CAA-related issues in the spirit of its manifesto commitment of “with all, development for all and trust of all”. He also said that even after Brexit, UK will remain India’s most important European partner and that the two sides will see expansion of trade diplomatic and security activities. “There is protest in every single democracy. I refer back to the ‘with all, development for all, and trust of all (sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas)’ as the objective set by this government and I am sure that in that ‘trust of all’ (is) the trust that it will be addressing the concerns that have been expressed about the CAA.

Briefing the media, he also expressed regret over threats that, he said, Indian high commission may have felt because of violent protests on its premises. “I am glad to note that the last two protests have passed off without serious concern.

 Feel foreign forces behind creating misunderstanding over CAA to weaken India: Rajnath Singh | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Senior BJP leader and Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday claimed that he felt ""foreign forces"" were trying to ""weaken"" India by ""misleading"" people against the amended citizenship law. Addressing an election meeting in Jangpura Assembly constituency, Singh reiterated that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was not going to take away any Indian Muslim's citizenship but still misunderstanding was being created among them. ""No Indian citizen including Muslims will loose their citizenship due to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Still, if the citizenship of a Muslim is questioned by anyone, the BJP will stand with him,"" he said. ""Misunderstanding is being spread to mislead the people. I feel there certainly is the hand of foreign forces behind this, who want to weaken India. The decision is to be made by you, where do you want the country to head,"" Singh said. He said India is not a Hindu nation and its history is written with love. ""India is not a Hindu nation, it's a secular state. Some people are trying to write history of the country through the ink of hatred. But we have scripted our history through the ink of love and affection,"" the Union minister said. He said around 600 Pakistani Muslims were given Indian citizenship in the last five-six years, asserting that the CAA was not against the minority community in India. ""We have not committed any crime by giving citizenship to minorities including Hindus and Sikhs persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. We are not the people who practice Hindu-Muslim politics,"" he said. Singh also said political parties were free to discharge their duties as the Opposition but they also needed to keep in mind ""their duty towards the nation in terms of the CAA"". Seeking vote for the BJP, he slammed the Kejriwal government alleging that it not only failed to fulfil its promises with the people of Delhi but also did not implement the Modi government's schemes for them including the Ayushman Bharat health scheme. ""No leader in a democracy has the right to cause loss of people for his own benefit. But he (Kejriwal) did this by obstructing the Ayushman Bharat and other schemes of the Centre, thinking Prime Minister Narendra Modi will become popular among the people,"" Singh said. He cited the Modi government's achievements, including abrogation of Article 370 provisions, and said Kashmir will witness ""such a development"" in coming years that even people of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) will demand to merge with India.

Joint anti-CAA motion set for debate in European Parliament - Times of India,"LONDON: A joint motion, combining five different resolutions tabled by Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) against India's Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), has been placed on the final agenda for debate at the Plenary session in Brussels on Wednesday. The motion takes note of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) statement last month, which described the CAA as ""fundamentally discriminatory in nature"", and also of other UN as well as the European Union (EU) guidelines on human rights as it calls on the Indian government to ""repeal the discriminatory amendments"". The debate on CAA on Wednesday will follow the European Parliament's historic ratification of the Brexit bill, under which the UK is set to formally leave the economic bloc on Friday. ""While the CAA's stated goal of protecting persecuted groups is welcome, an effective national asylum and refugee policy should be just and holistic in nature and apply to all those in need,"" notes the motion, which describes the CAA as ""discriminatory in nature and dangerously divisive"". The Indian government has maintained that the CAA, which was passed by the Indian Parliament last month, is an internal matter of the country and stressed that the goal is to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries. It has been extremely critical of the move in Brussels, which the European Commission – the executive arm of the economic bloc – has sought to distance itself from. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday wrote to European Parliament President David Maria Sassoli over the resolutions, saying it is inappropriate for one legislature to pass judgement on another and the practice can be misused by vested interests. ""As members of Inter Parliamentary Union, we should respect sovereign processes of fellow legislatures, especially in democracies,"" Birla said in the letter. The European Parliament motion is critical of any protection being denied to Muslims and that even though India also shares a border with Bhutan, Burma, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the CAA does not bring Sri Lankan Tamils under its purview, who form the largest refugee group in India and who have been resident in the country for over 30 years. ""Amnesty International India has pointed out that the CAA does not bring under its purview other persecuted minorities, including Muslim populations such as the Rohingya in Burma, Ahmadis in Pakistan, Hazaras in Afghanistan and Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh,"" it notes. There is also a reference to the Indian government's ""push"" for a nationwide citizenship verification process, the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which it says ""aims to strip Muslims of their citizenship rights while protecting those of Hindus and other non-Muslims"". The motion combines the separate resolutions tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE), Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE), Renew Europe Group (Renew) and European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) Group, representing around 560 of a total 751 MEPs. A sixth group, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), had withdrawn its resolution and references to the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in some of the resolutions have not found their way into the final motion. Such a move, which has been characterised under the ""Relations with Asian countries"" section by the economic bloc, are used as a basis for engagement of EU member countries with specific nations. If it is passed during a vote scheduled on Thursday, it will be formally sent to the Indian government and Parliament as well as to the European Commission chiefs. While EU officials are keen to highlight that the motion reflects individual views of MEPs and does not reflect an EU-wide stance, the impact of the motion is likely to resonate with the EU-India relationship as the motion notes that the Strategic Partnership between the European Union and India is based on the shared values of democracy and respect for human rights.

"Rajasthan CM: Centre fails on all fronts, adopts diversionary tactics | Jaipur News - Times of India","JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot claimed that the NDA government which had failed on all fronts are now adopting diversionary tactics. He was speaking at the Youva Aakrosh rally attended by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at Ram Niwas Bagh in Jaipur on Tuesday. He said the contentious issues like Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), NRC, Article 370 and mandir etc are raked up to divert the attention of the people from the real issues of unemployment, economic crisis, price rise and farm distress.

He exhorted the youth to take the message of Rahul Gandhi to universities, colleges, villages and panchayats to defeat the designs of the fascist forces. Pradesh Congress Committee president and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot alleged that the ruling dispensation at the Centre is unconcerned about joblessness and economic slowdown.

" Don't mess with resurgent strong India, Rajnath Singh tells Pakistan | India News - Times of India","MANGALURU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday sent out a strong message to India’s estranged neighbour Pakistan reminding the Imran Khan regime there that it is dealing with a strong, resurgent country. India is now in line with powerful nations, which will not provoke anyone, but at the same time will not spare anyone that dares mess with it, he said. “Hum kisi ko chedenge nahin, par jo hum ko chedega, hum usko chodenge nahin,” he noted. Sending out this warning at well-attended CAA, NRC awareness campaign in this coastal city, Rajnath amidst chants of “Modi, Modi”, reminded Pakistan of this new India’s resolve in carrying out surgical strike on terror launch pads across the international line of control. Noting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to see a prosperous neighbourhood, he said this has been the effort since he took over office in 2014 for the first time. Noting that one can change their friends, but not neighbours, Rajnath said it was Modi who had directed him to invite heads of all SAARC nations including then Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif when he took oath of office for the first time. “India has been sincere in its effort for better relationship with all its neighbours including Pakistan since 2014 but is obvious to the world that Pakistan is not following its dharma of a peaceful neighbour,” he noted.

 No power can stop Kashmiri Pandits from returning to Kashmir: Rajnath Singh | India News - Times of India,"MANGALURU: No power can now stop Kashmiri Pandits from going back to Kashmir, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday, forcefully defending the NDA government's decision to reorganize Jammu and Kashmir and abrogating its special status under Article 370. In an address at a rally, the defence minister also sent a strong message to Pakistan and said India will not let anyone live in peace if it is harmed. ""We will not touch anyone, but if someone bothers us, then we are not going to let them live in peace,"" he said. Referring to the exodus of a large number of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley in the late 1990s at the height of militancy, Singh said no power now can stop them from returning to their homes. On the Citizenship Amendment Act, the minister said it is not a law to hurt the sentiments of any religion but to give relief to victims of religious persecution. Mahatma Gandhi had told Nehru to give citizenship to minorities like Hindus and Sikhs if they come to India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has fulfilled that vision by bringing in the law, Singh said. On several non-BJP states refusing to implement the CAA, the defence minister said it it is a central law and everyone should follow it.

 India restores some internet access in Kashmir after long shutdown | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Months after imposing a sweeping communications blackout in Kashmir, the Indian government on Saturday unblocked several hundred websites in Jammu and Kashmir, bringing a tentative end to the world’s longest internet shutdown in a democracy. The announcement comes nearly half a year after India’s government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, revoked Kashmir’s semiautonomous status. Bracing for subsequent unrest, authorities suspended landline and cellular connections, cut internet services and dispatched tens of thousands of troops to the area. Since then, the Kashmir Valley, home to as many as 8 million people, has endured a punishing information blackout. Foreign journalists and diplomats were blocked from visiting the predominantly Muslim territory. The government arrested scores of Kashmiris, including former heads of state, without disclosing charges. Ordinary Kashmiris struggled to procure medicines and contact loved ones. The lifting of restrictions on Saturday applied only to 301 ""whitelisted"" websites. Among them were entertainment platforms like Amazon and some international news outlets, including The New York Times. Many Indian publications remained blocked, along with all social media. Mobile data access was also restored, though it was limited to 2G connections. ""It is very slow — and a good joke,"" said Sajeel Majid, 35, a restaurant owner in Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir. ""India wants to deceive the world by saying we have restored internet, but we can’t even access email with 2G speed."" Though some Kashmiris said the partial restoration of internet services could bring some semblance of normalcy to the region, they pointed out that shops remained largely shut and troops were still posted everywhere. Over the last week, around half a dozen Kashmiri militants were killed in gunbattles with Indian forces, who have been accused of torturing civilians and using excessive force against protesters. In a statement, the government of Jammu and Kashmir said continued internet restrictions were necessary to prevent the ""propagation of terror activities"" and the ""circulation of inflammatory material."" Officials said they would approve more websites in the coming days. India has increasingly come under scrutiny, both domestically and abroad, for cutting off the internet, a tactic more commonly associated with dictatorships than democracies. The country tops the world in the number of internet shutdowns, with 134 last year, according to SFLC.in, a legal advocacy group in New Delhi that tracks such restrictions. This month, the Supreme Court ruled that internet access was integral to an individual’s right to freedom of speech and expression. Judges said the government’s methods in Kashmir were an “arbitrary exercise of power,” though they stopped short of declaring them illegal. Hours after the government lifted some restrictions, Kashmiris said webpages — including approved ones — were again blocked for Republic Day festivities on Sunday, which commemorate the day when India’s constitution went into effect. ""It is just a game to tell people we have restored internet services, but on the ground it doesn’t work and is of no use,"" said Adnan Bhat, 19, a student in Srinagar.

 Mobile phone services in Kashmir now restored | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Mobile phone services and 2G Internet services were restored in Kashmir on Sunday hours after being suspended as a precautionary measure for ensuring an incident-free Republic Day celebration in the Valley, officials said. ""Mobile telephone services were restored at 4.00 pm across Kashmir,"" one of the officials said. 2G mobile Internet services was restored around 9 pm, officials said. Suspension of mobile phone and internet services on Republic Day and Independence Day have been part of the security drill in the Valley since 2005 when militants used a mobile phone to trigger an IED blast near the venue of Independence day celebrations. On Saturday, hours after low-speed mobile internet was restored in Kashmir, authorities again snapped services, citing security reasons in view of Republic Day. Mobile Internet was restored after being suspended nearly six months ago in the wake of the Centre's decision to revoke Article 370, but the service could only be used to access 301 websites approved by the administration, the officials said.

Digvijaya Singh invokes Gandhi when asked about scrapping of Article 370 | Bhopal News - Times of India,"Bhopal: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday said that he often wonders what Mahatma Gandhi would have done after the abrogation of Article 370. The former chief minister was speaking at the release of a book titled ‘Gandhi Ek Bharat’ by Dr Bramhadeep Alune here in the state capital. “Mahatma Gandhi had many attributes. He always practised what he preached, especially on truth and non-violence. It is our misfortune that on his 150th birth anniversary, we are witnessing something that he would never have approved,” Digvijaya said. The Congress stalwart said that after the abrogation of Article 370, he was asked for his reaction and that is when he thought of Mahatma Gandhi. “When I was asked for my reaction on the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, I thought what Gandhiji would have done,” Digvijaya said. “The Mahatma would have immediately undertaken a ‘padayatra’ (march) from the Red Fort in Delhi to the Lal Chowk in Srinagar because the way the special status for Jammu & Kashmir was revoked has increased suspicion among the residents there,” Digvijaya added. In an early morning tweet, the Congress veteran also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). “Modiji knows the religion of people by the clothes they wear. Vijayvargiya can identify the citizenship of people by the way they eat ‘poha’. Will our citizenship now be decided on how we dress or how we eat poha?

 Militancy remains biggest concern despite drastic decline in violence: Murmu | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor G C Murmu on Saturday said militancy remains the biggest concern as innocent youth are indoctrinated to take misguided paths in the union territory. ""On this day, I salute the bravery of our police and security forces for battling militancy and ensuring that there is public order in Jammu and Kashmir. The nation is proud of them,"" Murmu said in his Republic Day message here. Extending greetings to the people on the occasion of the 71st Republic Day, Murmu said, ""We also pay homage to civilians who have fallen prey to wanton violence."" ""Militancy remains our biggest concern as innocent youth are indoctrinated to take misguided paths. Although incidents of militancy have come down drastically, the threat posed by it requires attention not only to eradicate it but also prevent loss due to it,"" he said. He said the valiant security personnel need to continue to be on guard to thwart any attempts to disturb peace across Jammu and Kashmir, thereby disrupting the development, growth and opportunities for peace-loving people. Referring to various curbs in the aftermath of abrogation of provisions of Article 370 last August, Murmu said these restrictions were necessary owing to the problems being created and propaganda from across the border. ""Our priority was that there should be no bloodshed which we have achieved,"" he said. He said the restrictions on many fronts have been largely relaxed in a gradual manner. ""We facilitated people to perform their tasks even under difficult circumstances. I thank the people of Jammu and Kashmir for cooperating on this front,"" he said. On the security front, a substantial number of bunkers are now complete in border areas of Jammu and the rest would be completed soon.

 Bearded Omar Abdullah fires up Twitter; Mamata calls situation unfortunate | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: A photograph of detained former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah surfaced on Twitter on Saturday in which he seemed almost unrecognisable sporting a salt and pepper beard, triggering reactions of awe and anger from netizens, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Omar is among the three former chief ministers of the erstwhile state who continue to be in custody since August 5 when the Centre abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and divided it in two Union Territories. This is first picture of 49-year-old Omar to have appeared in public domain after five months of captivity. It showed him smiling in a snow covered jacket and sporting an unkempt greyish beard. ""I could not recognize Omar in this picture. Am feeling sad. Unfortunate that this is happening in our democratic country. When will this end,"" West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asked on the micro-blogging site. Congress leader Milind Deora tweeted that successive Indian governments have benefited richly from Abdullah's economic and political views. ""...Muting nationalists like him made our national discourse poorer. Complete normalcy must be restored soon,"" he said. Congress spokesperson Salman Soz said that after seeing Omar Abdullah's ""leaked"" photo, some were asking the NC leader to come back on Twitter and carry on as usual. ""It's as if he is off on a holiday. The govt illegally detained him (and others), judiciary played along, most media asked no questions. You are complicit,"" he said on twitter. ""How bad must it be that we are feeling happy just to see a smiling pic of the former CM of J&K @OmarAbdullah. Would truly be a happy moment when he and the rest are out and about, not under house arrest, hear them speak and read his tweets. Till then just the pic brings hope!,"" Shiv Sena Deputy leader Priyanka Chaturvedi said. Omar and two former chief ministers -- his father Farooq Abdullah and political rival Mehbooba Mufti -- were detained along with a large number of politicians, activists, lawyers on August 5 under section 107 of Code of Criminal Procedure. The stringent provision allows local law enforcement authorities to put a person in preventive custody for a period of six months if that person is suspected to commit a breach peace or disturb public tranquillity.

 Mahatma Gandhi would have marched from Red Fort to Lal Chowk: Digvijaya Singh | India News - Times of India,"BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday said he often wonders what Mahatma Gandhi would have done after abrogation of Article 370. Singh was speaking at the release of a book titled, 'Gandhi Ek Bharat' by Bramhadeep Alune. “Mahatma Gandhi had many attributes. He always practiced what he preached, especially on truth and non-violence. It is our misfortune that on his 150th birth anniversary, we are witnessing something he would never have approved,” Digvijaya Singh said. He said that after abrogation of Article 370, he was asked for his reaction, and he thought of Mahatma Gandhi. ""When I was asked for my reaction on abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, I thought what Gandhiji would have done,"" Digvijaya Singh said. ""He would have immediately undertaken a padyatra from Red Fort to Lal Chowk because the way Article 370 was revoked has increased suspicion among residents of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he added. In an early morning tweet, Digvijaya Singh also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya over citizenship. The tweet said, ""Modiji knows the religion of persons by the clothes worn by them. Vijayvargiya can identify the citizenship of people by the way they eat poha. Will our citizenship now be decided on how we dress or how we eat poha? Modi hai toh sab mumkin hai (Everything is possible when it is Modi).""

 Pakistan trying to revive terrorism in Chenab valley: J&amp;K DGP | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Pakistan is trying to revive terrorism in Chenab valley, Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police Dilbag Singh said on Saturday, stressing upon his men to make strenuous efforts to make the region militancy-free once again. ""This (Chenab valley) region was once a hot-bed of terrorism before it was completely cleared some time back but over time due to the continuous efforts by Pakistan agencies, some nine terrorists became active in the twin districts of Kishwar and Doda,"" Singh told reporters during his visit to Doda district on the eve of Republic Day. He said Pakistan is trying to revive terrorism in Chenab valley but the joint efforts of police and Central Armed Police forces, the terrorist networks have been smashed and overground workers and their support systems have also been busted. ""Of the nine active terrorists, four were killed and two others were arrested (in the last five months). Three are still active in Kishtwar and another, hailing from Kashmir, is operating in Doda to disturb peace,"" he said. Accompanied by Inspector General of Police, Jammu, Mukesh Singh, the police chief took stock of the security and law and order situation in the district and held a meeting with officers and jawans at district police lines. The DGP, who also visited Batote and interacted with General Officer Commanding of Army's Delta Force, Major General Ravi Murugan, complimented the Doda Police personnel for remaining calm during tough times and handling any situation professionally, especially after the abrogation of Article 370. Appreciating the police for their ""excellent work"" to tackle militancy in the region, the DGP said it was very difficult to serve in the district due to its tough terrain. He also lauded the police personnel for eliminating terrorists by carrying out well planned and successful operations and stressed upon them to take care of the district so that militancy does not revive there. ""We need to make strenuous efforts to wipe out the residual militancy from the district and make it militancy free once again,"" the officer said. The DGP also laid emphasis on launching a special drive to detain drug peddlers under the Public Safety Act to ensure a drug-free society. ""People's cooperation in handling drug menace is important,"" he said and directed the officers to hold police-public meetings. ""Any individual involved or associated with anti national activities or drug peddling should be strictly dealt with,"" he said. During his meeting with Maj Gen Murugan at Batote, the DGP had a threadbare discussion on the prevailing security scenario with the GOC, a police spokesperson said.

 Nepal offers to play role of mediator between India and Pakistan | India News - Times of India,"KATHMANDU: Nepal on Saturday became the first South Asian nation to offer to ""mediate"" between India and Pakistan over Kashmir and cross-border terrorism with a Nepal government source underlining the importance of dialogue between the two arch-rivals to resolve their differences that could also lead to the revival of the SAARC. Tensions between India and Pakistan have spiked since India abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year. India's decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian envoy. ""Peaceful talks and discussions are the best ways to resolve any problems. There may be contradictions and differences but it can be resolved through dialogue. If necessary, we can play the role of the mediator as Nepal is an independent, neutral and peace loving country,"" the source said here. The source, however, said that better solution to resolve the issues would be to develop better dialogue between two countries. ""We can be instrumental, but it will be better (for the two sides) to develop direct contact,"" the source told a group of visiting Indian journalists. Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump repeated his offer to ""help"" resolve the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan during his meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. New Delhi maintains that there is no scope for any third-party mediation between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. ""When we come together, sit together and share views then things will be resolved. In every situation, we have to sit together and try to resolve the problem otherwise things can be deteriorated,"" the Nepalese source said. Expressing concern over the uncertainty prevailing over the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit, the source said the eight member grouping should be revitalised and misunderstandings should be removed. ""SAARC is not dead. It is alive. Only thing is that we have not met. Hope we can revive it,"" he said. The last SAARC Summit in 2014 was held in Kathmandu, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The 2016 SAARC summit was to be held in Islamabad. But after the terrorist attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on September 18 that year, India expressed its inability to participate in the summit due to ""prevailing circumstances"". The summit was called off after Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan also declined to participate in the Islamabad meet. In the last three years, India has been distancing itself from the SAARC, citing security challenge facing the region from terror networks based in Pakistan, which is also a member of the grouping. Nepal is still the Chairman of the SAARC because of the postponement of the 2016 summit in Islamabad. On Friday, Nepal's foreign minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said his country is ""ready and eager"" to handover the position to Pakistan. The source said that there was no link between SAARC and terrorism, a major issue between India and Pakistan that led to the cancellation of the 2016 summit. ""We are strongly against all forms and manifestations of terrorism. But there is no relationship between the two (SAARC and terrorism). We cannot connect the two issues,"" the source said. Nepal, India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are the members of the SAARC. Identifying terrorism as a common threat to peace loving countries, the source said, ""We have to deal with the issue of terrorism"". ""I think that misunderstandings should be narrowed down and SAARC should be revitalised. It would be better to revise SAARC. I have told India that SAARC should be revitalised. We can find out amicable solutions,"" the source said. SAARC summits are usually held biennially and hosted by member states in alphabetical order. The member state hosting the summit assumes the Chair of the Association. On the boundary issue with India, the source said the two countries can discuss any issue based on ""truth, evidences and facts"". India in November released fresh maps of the newly-created union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. In the maps, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is part of Jammu and Kashmir, while Gilgit-Baltistan is in Ladakh. Nepal claimed that Limpiyadhura, Lipulek and Kalapani areas were shown under India's territory even though they lie within the Nepalese territory. India has said the new map accurately depicts its sovereign territory and it has in no manner revised its boundary with Nepal. ""We can resolve any issue if we discuss. Sometimes some issues are left unresolved. We should not keep something in mind and don't speak out. This is not the situation now,"" the source said. ""We can share and discuss openly, including on the border issue. We are developing our friendly ties in a new track and depth,"" he said, adding that the leaders of the two sides have developed very good relations and taken the bilateral ties to the next level. On National Register of Citizens (NRC) and its possible impact on Nepali speaking people and Gorkhas, the source said Nepal has been reassured by the statement of defence minister Rajnath Singh that it would not have any impact on them.

Lucknow University may add CAA in curriculum | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Nationwide protests against the amended citizenship law have apparently prompted Lucknow University's political science department to consider a proposal to include Citizenship Amendment Act in its curriculum. The university had recently included Article 370 and 'refugees' as topics under the 'Contemporary Issues in Indian Politics' paper. Talking to TOI, head of the political science department, Shashi Shukla, said, the proposal was being discussed and would have to be sent to the board of studies for approval. ""CAA is a contemporary issue and can be taught for the paper on 'Contemporary Issues in Indian Politics'. Since everyone, including students, is talking about it, we thought it could be part the syllabus,"" she said.  The topic has been discussed by the faculty and there has been a consensus to forward the proposal to the board of studies for clearance. Thereafter, it will be sent to the faculty board and later to the academic council for final approval. If cleared, CAA would be in the curriculum by next year, said Shukla.  Clarifying there was no recommendation to include CAA in the syllabus from the ministry of human resource development or the state government, she said the department was considering it as a contemporary political issue.  While the matter is still in the proposal stage, BSP chief Mayawati hit out at Lucknow University, claiming it had already included in the syllabus. The former UP chief minister tweeted - A debate on CAA is all right, but when the matter is in court, the Lucknow University's decision to introduce it in the curriculum is divisive, condemnable and inappropriate. BSP promises that when it returns to power, it will roll back the decision."" On Tuesday, Union home minister Amit Shah had challenged Opposition party leaders to a debate on CAA.

" Raj Thackeray supports CAA, rails against Muslims, launches his son, changes party flag | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray came out in full support of the Citizenship Amendment Act questioning locals Muslims why they were protesting in favour of the Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims. “Throw out the illegal Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims. I fully support the Centre for this,” said Thackeray adding that while he had criticised Modi he would not hesitate to support him when he does the right thing. “India needs to intensify its security even if it mean people are inconvenienced. We are sitting on a ticking bomb. It is important to throw out the Muslims from Pakistan and Bangladesh and for this I am with the Prime Minister,” he said. He announced his party would hold rallies on February 9 in support of the CAA. Like other countries India must act against illegal migrants, he said. While he said he stood for the Muslims of the country he would not tolerate those Muslims who fanned trouble in the country. Defending Urdu he said it was not the language of the Muslims and reminded his supporters that Bangladeshis demanded a separate country for the Bengali language and not for Urdu. “Is India a Dharamshala? I am told it costs only Rs 2,500 to make your way from Bangladesh into India. From Pakistan they come via Nepal. Stop the Samjhauta Express and the bus service. Why do we have any relations with Pakistan?” he asked. Religion he said was a personal thing. Targeting the Muslims he said, “Keep your religion in your house. Shut off the loudspeakers on Masjids. Our Aarti does not trouble why should Namaaz harass others?” he questioned. The party held its first ever convention at the NESCO grounds, Goregaon marking 14 years of its formation. Thackeray used the opportunity to formally launch his son Amit as a party leader. Thackeray who changed his party’s flag to saffron with Shivaji Maharaj’s royal stamp on it said the flag had been first used by the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti which, however, disintegrated and led to the birth of the Shiv Sena. “When the MNS was being formed in 2006 I wanted to make this the party flag but advisors told me to include green. What they now call social engineering. I was 36-37 years then and had no one to guide me so I went along. But the flag never left me and six years ago we used it at our annual party rally during Gudi Padva,” he said. “This flag is my DNA and I decided to bring it forth for this convention. The Raj Mudra is our inspiration. This flag is to be well taken care of by the one handling it and not left lying on the floor. This flag is not to be used during elections. For that we have the other flag,” he said. On changing the party flag, he said the Jan Sangh in the 80s had changed its flag and name to Bharatiya Janata Party. “One has to shed one’s old skin for a positive change,” he said. In a lacklustre speech, he said he was a Marathi and a Hindu and would fight anyone who challenged these identities. On him going the Hindutva way, Thackeray said no one asked him if he was standing up for Hindutva when he protested the Raza Academy demonstrators misbehaving with women constables or when party workers chased away Pakistani singers. Nor did anyone asked if he was for Hindutva when he resisted the restrictions placed on the number of tiers for Dahi Handi. “Why are you asking now where we are going?” he asked rhetorically. He warned there are mohallas in Maharashtra where a conspiracy is being hatched against the country. He said, he would share this information with the union home minister and the chief minister. He congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Article 370, the Supreme Court for allowing the Ram Mandir. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Abrogation of Article 370 has now become fait accompli, should be accepted: Centre to SC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The abrogation of the provisions of Article 370, which granted special status to erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir, has now become a ""fait accompli"" leaving sole option to accept the change, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Thursday. Vehemently opposing the contention that Jammu and Kashmir was not integrated with India, the Centre told the top court if that was the case, then there would not have been a need for Article 370. It opposed reference of a batch of pleas, challenging the constitutional validity of the Centre's decision of August 5 last year to abrogate provisions of Article 370, to a larger seven-judge bench. A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice N V Ramana reserved its verdict on the question of referring the issue to a larger bench and said it would pass a detailed order in this regard. NGO People's Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association and an intervenor had sought referring the matter to a larger bench of seven-judges. They have sought reference on the ground that two judgements of apex court -- Prem Nath Kaul versus Jammu and Kashmir in 1959 and Sampat Prakash versus Jammu and Kashmir in 1970 -- which dealt with the issue of Article 370 are in direct conflict each other and therefore the current bench of five judges could not hear the issue. Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre told the bench -- also comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant -- that ""the abrogation of provisions of Article 370, has now become a ""fait accompli"" leaving sole option to accept the change"". He said the events which transpired prior to the notification of August 5 and August 6, 2019 are of no significance. ""The arguments of other side that no integration of Jammu and Kashmir had taken place, no standstill agreement or merger documents between Jammu and Kashmir and India were executed, are of no use. If the integration of Jammu and Kashmir had not taken place then there is no place for Article 370,"" Venugopal said. He referred to a book, 'The Story of the Integration of the Indian States', written by V P Menon who was secretary to India's first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and said that Instrument of Accession signed by Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir shows that ""sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir was only temporary. We are a union of states"". Venugopal referred to the history of Jammu and Kashmir and said that Hari Singh had signed a standstill agreement with Pakistan, which later violated and sent 300 trucks of tribesman trained by Pakistani Army to attack Kashmir. It was only after that, to secure himself and the state, he had signed the Instrument of Accession with India and subsequently the Indian army pushed back those tribesman. He said that long before Jammu and Kashmir had its Constitution, many provisions of Indian Constitution was applied to the state. ""The question of referendum does not arise in light of this permanent declaration of Jammu and Kashmir being an integral part of India,"" he said, and read out the preamble of J&K's Constitution. He stated that there is no question of plebiscite in light of the explicit declarations of Jammu and Kashmir to be an integral part of India in their own Constitution. ""Therefore it is wrong to say that total integration of Jammu and Kashmir had not taken place. Today to say that there was no plebiscite or agreement of merger or standstill documents were not executed is not correct and these arguments cannot be raised at this stage,"" Venugopal said, adding that ""Article 370 has now become fait accompli"". He said that after the Instrument of Accession, no question can be raised on the total integration of Jammu and Kashmir and referred to Constitution of the erstwhile state. Referring to the two earlier judgements, Venugopal said that they were not inconsistent to each other and both dealt with different issues. He said that 1959 verdict of Prem Nath Kaul did not deal with Article 370, rather it dealt with the question whether the Maharaja had the legislative power or not. Referring to Sampat Prakash verdict of 1970, Venugopal said though it dealt with some aspects of Article 370, it was not in direct conflict with verdict in the Kaul case and therefore the present issue should not be referred to a larger bench. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Jammu and Kashmir administration said he adopts the arguments of the Attorney General and favours no reference to larger bench. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference said that he is supporting Centre on the question that no reference is needed to a larger bench. He, however, questioned on the validity of Centre's August 5, last year decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 saying it completely destroyed constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and the treaty. ""Here is a case where a state has been demoted to Union territories. This has never happened in the country before, If it was a case of security then at best it was a matter of Article 356 (President's Rule). In fact it is a case of glaring illegality,"" Dhavan said. A number of petitions have been filed in the matter including those of private individuals, lawyers, activists and political parties and they have also challenged the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which splits J&K into two union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

India and Pakistan have been at odds after New Delhi abrogated the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two union territories. Pakistan reacted strongly to India's decision and downgraded bilateral ties and expelled the Indian envoy. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was an internal matter. It has also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."

" Abrogation of Article 370 irreversible, Centre tells SC | India News - Times of India","The Central government on Thursday told the Supreme Court that the abrogation of Article 370 allowed the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian union and said that the move is ""irreversible"". A five-Judge Constitution Bench of Justices NV Ramana, SK Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, BR Gavai and Surya Kant today continued hearing various pleas challenging the abrogation of Article 370, which conferred special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Attorney General KK Venugopal submitted how accession of the new Union Territory to Indian union took place and said that ""it (abrogation of Article 370) is irreversible"". ""I want to show that sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir was indeed temporary. We are a Union of States,"" Venugopal told the court. Advocate Dr Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for one of the petitioners, said: ""A State was demoted to the status of a Union Territory using Article 3 of the Constitution of India for the first time. If they (Centre) do this for one State, they can do it for any State."" Dhavan said that the Central government deliberately imposed President's Rule in the erstwhile state and pointed to a map of Jammu and Kashmir. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing Jammu and Kashmir, interrupted Dhavan and said that ""what he is saying is irrelevant"". On this, Dhavan replied, ""If Attorney General could bring (JL) Nehru in his historical trip, I can surely show milords a map. I do not have to take your permission.""

"India at UN: Pakistan 'spews venom', takes to hate speech like fish takes to water | India News - Times of India","UNITED NATIONS: India has slammed Pakistan for ""spewing venom and false narratives"" of monumental proportions in the United Nations, saying it takes to hate speech like fish takes to water and ""obfuscates"" the international community from the truth as Islamabad yet again raked up the   Kashmir issue   at the world body. Pakistan consistently rakes up the Kashmir issue at various UN platforms in a bid to internationalise it but has repeatedly failed to get any support. Last week, Islamabad failed in its efforts to get any traction from the membership of the UN Security Council when its 'all-weather ally'   China made another pitch   to raise the issue in the 15-nation Council. There was consensus among the rest of the Council members that Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan. India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu, speaking at a session of the General Assembly on 'Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization' on Wednesday, said Pakistan ""indulges in confabulations and obfuscates the international community from the truth"" instead of putting an end to the ""bellicose and vitriolic diatribe"" and taking steps to restore normal ties. ""Just like a fish takes to water, one delegation has again taken to hate speech. Every time this delegation speaks, it spews venom and false narratives of monumental proportions. ""It's extremely surprising that a country that has completely decimated its minority population talks about protecting minorities. Pakistan's practice of using false pretences to distract from addressing the malaise that afflicts it has run its course. Pakistan needs to reflect that there are no takers for its false rhetoric and should get down to the normal business of diplomacy,"" Naidu said. The Indian diplomat's strong response came after Saad Ahmed Warraich, Counsellor at Pakistan mission to the UN, raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in his remarks during the session, saying no other situation reflects the ""abdication"" of the UN's responsibility to discharge its responsibilities more than the decades-old Jammu and Kashmir issue. China's latest attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council on Pakistan's behalf failed last week, with an overwhelming majority of the body expressing the view that it was not the right forum to discuss the bilateral issue between India and Pakistan. It was China's third such attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the UNSC since August last when the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was scrapped by the government, and the state was bifurcated into two union territories. ""We once again saw an effort made by one member state of the UN, fail in plain view of all others. We are happy that neither alarmist scenario painted by the representatives of Pakistan nor any of the baseless allegations made repeatedly by representatives of Pakistan in the UN fora were found to be credible today,"" India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said last week. ""We are glad that the effort was viewed as a distraction and it was pointed by many friends that bilateral mechanisms are available to raise and address issues that Pakistan may have in its ties with India,"" Akbaruddin said after the January 15 Council meeting.

Pakistan has little credibility on J&amp;K: US report - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan has “limited options” to respond to India’s decision to abrogate Article 370 on Jammu & Kashmir and can only hope to gain from “self-inflicted” damage caused by New Delhi’s policies in Kashmir and on the citizenship law, US Congress’s research arm, the Congressional Research Service, has said. “Given also that Pakistan and its primary ally, China, enjoy limited international credibility on human rights issues, Islamabad may stand by and hope that self-inflicted damage caused by New Delhi's own policies in Kashmir and, more recently, on citizenship laws, will harm India’s reputation and perhaps undercut its recent diplomatic gains with Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE,” the CRS said. In a new report, the CRS said Pakistan’s diplomatic isolation as well as its “reduced” capability to alter the status quo in J&K through military means limited its options. “Many analysts view Islamabad as having little credibility on Kashmir, given its long history of covertly supporting militant groups there. Pakistan’s leadership has limited options to respond to India’s actions, and renewed Pakistani support for Kashmiri militancy likely would be costly internationally. Pakistan’s ability to alter the status quo through military action has been reduced in recent years, meaning that Islamabad likely must rely primarily on diplomacy,” the CRS said, noting that Pakistan appeared diplomatically isolated on the Kashmir issue and had only Turkey as its explicit ally. The CRS said following India’s August 2019 actions, numerous members of the US Congress went on record in support of Kashmiri human rights. A House resolution introduced in December and currently with 40 co-sponsors, urged the Indian government to end the restrictions on communications in J&K, it said. “Yet, any US impulse to tilt toward India is to some extent offset by Islamabad's current, and by most accounts vital, role in facilitating Afghan reconciliation negotiations. President Donald Trump's apparent bonhomie with Pakistan's prime minister and offer to mediate on Kashmir in July was taken by some as a new and potentially unwise strategic shift,” it said. Pakistan has been working hard to bring diplomatic pressure on India, including though China. China has called for a special discussion on Kashmir three times in the past six months. On August 16, the UNSC met for the first time in decades to discuss Kashmir. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."

Sharing the stage with Union home minister Amit Shah at a pro-CAA rally in Lucknow, Yogi said the BJP government took courageous steps that were for the good of the country, while Congress and other opposition parties only played vote-bank politics and worked to stay in power. ""BJP always put the nation above everything,"" the CM said.  Yogi attacked Congress for not accepting the citizenship law despite the fact that it was first introduced during the regime of Jawaharlal Nehru. ""Congress cannot see the country progressing and is conspiring to provoke people to stage protests and resort to violence,"" he said.

 SC to decide if pleas on Article 370 should go to seven-judge bench | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Before testing the validity of the Centre’s decision to scrap J&K’s special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and its reorganisation into two Union Territories, a five-judge bench of the SC on Tuesday said it would first decide whether to refer the contentious constitutional issue to a seven-judge bench. Senior advocates Dinesh Dwivedi and Sanjay Parikh, appearing for Prem Shankar Jha and NGO ‘People’s Union for Civil Liberties’ respectively, told a bench of Justices N V Ramana, Sanjay K Kaul, B Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant that there were three SC rulings by five-judges benches on the nature and character of Article 370 which were conflicting and sought reference of the matter to a seven-judge bench. Attorney general K K Venugopal said, “I oppose the plea to refer the petitions to a seven-judge bench.” Dwivedi and Parikh cited two over 50-year-old rulings by five-judge benches, in Prem Nath Kaul case and Sampat Prakash case, in which the SC had said Parliament could not change the character of Article 370 which gave special status to the state as it was in the form of a constitutional obligation that arose from the instrument of accession signed by the maharaja of Kashmir. They said the third judgment by another five-judge bench had ruled to the contrary while recognising Parliament’s power to amend Article 370. In Prem Nath Kaul case [AIR 1959 SC 749], the SC had said, “Neither the scheme of Article 370 nor the explanation to clause (1) of that article contemplated that the maharaja was to be a constitutional ruler. The temporary provisions of that article were based on the assumption that the ultimate relationship between India and the state should be finally determined by the constituent assembly of the state itself. So, that article could not, either expressly or by implication, be intended to limit the plenary legislative powers of the maharaja. Till the constituent assembly of the state, therefore, made its decision, the Instrument of Accession must hold the field.” In Sampat Prakash case [AIR 1970 SC 1118], the SC had said, “The political situation that existed when Article 370 was incorporated in the Constitution had not materially altered either in 1959 or 1964 and the purpose of introducing it was to empower the President to exercise his discretion in applying the Indian Constitution while that situation remained unchanged. Article 370(3) envisages that the article will continue to be operative until and can cease to be operative only on the recommendation of constituent assembly of the state, the President makes a direction to that effect. No such recommendation was made nor was any order made by the President. On the contrary, the constituent assembly of the state made a recommendation that the article should be operative with a modified explanation.” Arguments will continue on Wednesday.

 Article 370 was only 'tunnel of light' connecting Centre and erstwhile J&amp;K: SC told | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Article 370 of the Constitution was the only ""tunnel of light"" which maintained the relationship between the Centre and the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, the Supreme Court was told on Tuesday. Petitioners challenging the Centre's decision taken on August 5 last year to abrogate provisions of Article 370 contended that the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir cannot be repealed in exercise of powers under the Article, which gave special status to erstwhile state. A five-judge bench headed by Justice N V Ramana, was told by senior advocate Dinesh Dwivedi, appearing for an intervenor, Prem Shankar Jha, that the issue needs to be referred to a larger bench as there is a dispute between two judgements of a five-judge bench which dealt with provisions of Article 370. Besides challenging the Centre's decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370, Jha has sought reference of the issue to a larger bench of seven judges for definite adjudication. The bench, also comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant, said it would first hear the submissions on reference and then would take a call on whether to refer the issue to a larger bench. Dwivedi said the two judgements of the five-judge bench of the apex court in 1959 in Prem Nath Kaul versus Jammu and Kashmir and in 1970 in Sampat Prakash versus Jammu and Kashmir, which dealt with the issue of Article 370, were in conflict with each other. Dealing with the Presidential orders of August 5, last year, Dwivedi said due to these orders issued under Article 370 (1) and (3), all provisions of the Indian Constitution have been applied to Jammu and Kashmir. ""This virtually abolishes the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. It's a case of implied repeal where a Constitution has been repealed by an executive exercise of powers,"" he argued. Dwivedi said, ""Article 370 was the only tunnel of light connecting the Centre to erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Article 370 required that action of government of India should have concurrence of Jammu and Kashmir constituent assembly, which was dissolved in 1957 after framing the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir"". The senior lawyer said the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir was not created under the Constitution of India or Article 370 and therefore J&K constitution cannot be repealed in exercise of powers under Article 370. ""On August 5, 2019, the power under Article 370 (1)(d) could only be exercised in compliance with Article 370(2), which was impossible in absence of Constituent Assembly of J&K. The power to issue such Presidential Order under Article 370(1)(d) could not be exercised by the President with the concurrence advise of the Governor only,"" he said. Dwivedi said the substitution of ""legislative assembly of the state"" for ""Constituent Assembly"" with the concurrence of the state government or governor is void. ""Besides, one has to keep in mind that this legislative assembly is one which is a creature of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and not the Constitution of India where governor cannot be substitute,"" he said. The senior lawyer said the sole object of Article 370 was to ensure that people of Kashmir have a say in their own governance through their own Constitution but this guarantee has been wiped out after the entire Constitution of India is made applicable in the erstwhile state. ""Article 370 was temporary and was to cease after the enactment of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. Thereafter, the governing relationship between Union and the State was to be regulated by the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he added. Dwivedi concluded his arguments after which senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for NGO People's Union for Civil Liberties, commenced his submission and also sought reference of the issue to a larger bench. The hearing remained inconclusive and would continue on Wednesday. On December 12, the top court had said it may consider the question of referring the issue of challenge to the abrogation of provisions of Article 370 to a larger seven-judge bench after hearing the preliminary submission of all the parties. Earlier, senior advocate Raju Ramachandaran, appearing for bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faesal, Shehla Rashid and other petitioners, had argued that in the scheme of Article 370 while the democratic power is with the State, the executive power is with the Union government. The top court had earlier raised a query as to who could be the competent authority to reconstitute the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly to take a call on altering the special status of the erstwhile state under Article 370 of the Constitution. The petitioners have referred to the provision and said that only the Constituent Assembly, which represents the will of the people, is empowered to make recommendation to the President on any changes in the special status of J&K. A number of petitions have been filed in the matter including those of private individuals, lawyers, activists and political parties and they have also challenged the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which splits J&K into two union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

So far about 24 ministers visited different parts of Jammu. ""The visit of ministers' brigade is only to highlight the agenda of the party at the expense of public exchequer by use of entire official machinery, after feedback to the BJP government at the centre that people even in Jammu region are fed up with the neglect, especially the treatment meted out to the erstwhile state depriving it of the identity and rights of the locals,"" Pradesh Congress Committee chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said.

Sharma said the BJP should also explain the ""benefits"" of disbanding and downgrading of the erstwhile state with a unique history and culture into UTs. ""It should also give a timeline for the restoration of the statehood with guarantees for land and jobs to local unemployed youth whose number is one of the highest, as around three lakh PG scholars alone were registered a year ago in J and K,"" he said in a statement.

 Govt intends to make J&amp;K 'economic paradise' for investors: LG Murmu | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In a bid to attract investment to the new Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Lieutenant Governor Girish Chandra Murmu on Monday told the business community that the abrogation of erstwhile state's special status has removed all ""artificial barriers"" which will help make it an ""economic paradise"" for investors. The Jammu and Kashmir administration organised a first of its kind pre-summit investors' meet here, inviting investments from across the world by highlighting the untapped potential of the union territory. Speaking at the event, Murmu said, ""We intend to take a leap forward in making Jammu and Kashmir an economic paradise for investors and I would like to invite you all to take the lead in setting up your enterprises in the union territory."" He spoke about the situation that prevailed before the state was converted into a union territory and said investments were flowing into the state but the previous governments were not able to catch up with the investments. ""The former state was lagging behind"", he said. He said many apprehensions have been expressed about the situation after August 5, the day when the Centre revoked provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcated the state into two union territories. He said he was sure that they would be able to meet expectations as many issues were sorted after the re-processing of the constitutional system, which includes single window clearance system and number of investor friendly policies. After addressing the domicile issue and keeping the local employment in mind, all the ""artificial barriers"" created in the past because of the special status have been removed and now all the laws enacted by the central government are applicable to the UT as well, the lieutenant governor said. He asked investors to come and see the change for themselves saying ""seeing is believing"" and there are no restrictions anywhere. The situation is ""abnormal for militants only now"", he said. The event, which was a curtain-raiser to the three-day Global Investors' Summit to be held in Srinagar and Jammu this year, showcased policy and regulatory environment, investment opportunities in 14 focus sectors to boost manufacturing and employment generation in the region. Murmu said that the Global Investors' Meet -- with the theme of 'explore, invest and grow' -- is a platform that will bring together senior entrepreneurs, leaders from corporate sector across the country, senior policy makers, development agencies, investors from across the world and local businessmen. ""Today's Pre-Summit Investors' Interaction has been organised to deliberate with you all on desired initiatives for creating an investor-friendly ecosystem and make you interested in Jammu and Kashmir,"" Murmu said. Murmu, who is a retired IAS officer from Gujarat cadre, said the summit was inspired from the prime minister's vision of holding a similar meet during his tenure as chief minister of Gujarat. Minister of State Prime Minister's Office Jitendra Singh congratulated the UT administration for taking such an initiative ""at the right time and right place"". Singh said the prime minister's involvement in the region ""is leading to a lot of development in various sectors"". He also alleged that many corrupt practices were being followed by the past regime and spoke about the special focus now on the development of Jammu and Kashmir and the way the union territory benefitted by the policies of the central government. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Secretary B V R Subrahmanyam said, ""Jammu and Kashmir is little known about the places except what we have seen in the films, it is quite different what we know. J-K is not a backward place but it has the brightest and skilled people. I have read in a book that people in J-K don't die from the disease but from the old age."" The chief secretary added that the J-K administration is re-engineering all the processes and policies to break age-old barriers and creating a progressive ecosystem for investors. ""Easy availability of land through land bank and smooth clearances with dedicated teams to attend to investors will be the priority of the administration. It is one of the most beautiful and pollution-free places to work,"" he said. More than 350 delegates from various sectors and leading organisations participated in the event which held over 45 Business to Government meetings took place. The aim of the upcoming Global Investors' Summit 2020 is to exhibit the different investment opportunities available in the newly formed UT in different sectors including Tourism, Film Tourism, Horticulture and Post Harvest Management, Agro and Food Processing, Mulberry production for silk, Health and Pharmaceutical, Manufacturing, IT/ ITes, Renewable Energy, Infrastructure and Real Estate, Handloom and Handicraft and Education, said Kewal Kumar Sharma, Advisor to the LG.

Taking potshots at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi several times, he said: “I challenge Rahul Gandhi to prove CAA will take away citizenship of Muslims... please read the Act completely and if you find anything that takes away citizenship of Indian Muslims, Pralhad Joshi (Union parliamentary affairs minister) is ready to debate with you.” Justifying CAA implementation, he said the population of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains in countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh had dwindled to a meagre 3%. “Can Rahul baba explain what happened to these people in Pakistan and Bangladesh,” Shah asked, adding that he should be thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for fulfilling his grandfather’s dream. “Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Acharya Kriplani and Maulana Azad had originally mooted the idea of CAA. Now, Modi has actually turned their dream into reality,’’ he said, adding that even Mahatma Gandhi had wished according citizenship to minorities of neighbouring countries. Shah slammed Congress and other opposition parties, saying they were always against national issues like CAA, abrogation of Article 370, construction of Ram Mandir... They were all speaking the language of Pakistan and like Pakistani PM Imran Khan, were asking for proof of the surgical strike carried out by the Indian Air Force in Balakot. Defending police action against anti-CAA protesters, Shah said it was important to punish people who allegedly raised “anti-national slogans”. “A few years ago, anti-Indian slogans were chanted at JNU. Should we not punish these anti-Indian people,” he asked. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who attended the meeting, told the gathering: “We’ll work together under the leadership of Modi and Shah to strengthen the party at the booth level. We’ll give priority to irrigation in the interest of farmers. As we’re working for the people, we’ll definitely get support in the next election.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Three Union ministers arrive in Jammu to kick start outreach programme on Article 370 nullification | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Three Union ministers on Saturday reached here to kick-start a week-long massive awareness of the Centre to apprise people of the potential benefits of the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status after nullification of Article 370, officials said. The ministers -- Arjun Meghwal, Ashwini Choubey and Jitendra Singh -- were scheduled to reach here in the morning but their flight could not land here due to ""poor visibility"" due to fog and was diverted to Srinagar, they said. After waiting for several hours in Srinagar, the ministers finally reached Jammu this evening to launch the awareness programme under which a total of 36 Union ministers will visit different parts of the Union territory to interact with people during the next six days. As part of the programme, the 36 ministers are visiting Jammu and Kashmir this week to participate in 60 public interactions at various places in the Union territory,"" principal secretary to the Jammu and Kashmir government Rohit Kansal told reporters. Kansal, who is also the government spokesperson, said the visiting ministers would interact with people and speak to them on the theme of development. He said the administration has decided to ensure 100 per cent coverage for the eligible Jammu and KLashmir residents to 55 beneficiaries oriented schemes in the Union territory. ""In addition, the focus will be on rapid infrastructure development, the implementation of the Prime Ministers Development Package (PMDP), flagship schemes, iconic projects, good governance, rule of law, equal opportunities to all, rapid industrial growth with employment and rapid economic growth in all sectors of the economy with a special focus on income enhancement for all,"" he said. Reacting to the outreach programme from January 18 to 24, Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party chairman and former minister Harsh Dev Singh questioned as to how such a ""collective march"" of Central ministers would benefit people of the new union territory. ""The macabre drama appeared to have been conceptualized as a political fire cracker ahead of the elections by the BJP to whip up hysteria in its favour. It's the last roll of the dice by the saffron party ahead of elections,"" he told reporters. He said after failing to live up to the people's expectations, the government was resorting to ""gimmicks and ministerial shows"" which would meet the same fate as its earlier drama of 'Feedback to Village' programme. ""It is a publicity stunt, a pressure tactics, a holy hypocrisy and a survival mantra in the face of fast dissipating credibility of the BJP which wants to bring almost half of the central ministers to disseminate its political philosophy at the cost of public exchequer without analyzing the financial fallouts of such gigantic roller coaster exercise upon a cash-starved UT like Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. Accusing the BJP leadership of indulging in ""theatrics and tantrums to woo voters"", Singh said the people of Jammu and Kashmir could no longer be ""seduced by pomp and show"" of such ministerial functions. No gimmickry could now beguile them. They were fast realising that Jammu and Kashmir was being used as an electoral trump card by saffron party to brighten its prospects in elections across the country,"" he said, adding slogans like Article 370 were being used to promote the party in other parts of the country without addressing the genuine concerns of the people of Jammu and kashmir post reorganization. ""The Centre has failed to come up with a law on domicile so as to protect the jobs and lands of locals despite its loud pronouncements. The internet services continued to be blocked despite categorical directives of the Supreme Court to review the gag order,"" the NPP leader said. He said rather than visiting the union territory to fulfil their urge for ""photogenic teleshoots"", the BJP leadership might as well restore the civil liberties and other democratic rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir who are bearing the brunt of a ""dictatorial, authoritarian"" regime.

Accompanied by J&K Congress chief GA Mir, Azad said, “After the bifurcation, there is a total mess and the Government of India is also ‘confused’ over running the government in J&K.” After the nullification of Article 370, J&K has suffered huge losses, he said. “Tourism — which is the backbone of J&K’s economy — has come to an end, transport has been affected, loss of fruits and vegetables has increased manifold, and unemployment is on rise.” Azad, who was former CM of the erstwhile state, said the Centre has “fooled” people by creating UTs and by putting politicians under detention. “We condemn that the Government of India has no clear policy on Jammu and Kashmir,” Azad said. Lashing out at the Centre, he said: “Media across the world wrote about the current situation, restrictions including no internet in Jammu and Kashmir, but here [in J&K] nobody was allowed to report the truth.” He claimed foreign envoys, who visited the UT recently, were allowed to meet selective people, who only raised positive voices and lauding the Centre.

" Article 370: Pakistan's use of false pretences at UN has run its course, India says | India News - Times of India","UNITED NATIONS: India has slammed Pakistan for again trying to raise the Kashmir issue in the UN Security Council where it failed one more time to find any support, with New Delhi asserting that Islamabad needs to focus on the hard tasks it has to address in order to ensure normal relations with India. China, Pakistan's 'all-weather ally', on Wednesday made the fresh pitch to raise the Kashmir issue under ""other matters"" during closed consultations in the Security Council consultations room. The   attempt failed   as other member countries felt Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan. India's permanent representative to the UN Syed Akbaruddin said: ""We once again saw an effort made by one member state of the UN, fail in plain view of all others"". ""We are happy that neither alarmist scenario painted by the representatives of Pakistan nor any of the baseless allegations made repeatedly by representatives of Pakistan in the UN fora were found to be credible today,"" Akbaruddin said. ""We are glad that the effort was viewed as a distraction and it was pointed by many friends that bilateral mechanisms are available to raise and address issues that Pakistan may have in its ties with India,"" he said. Akbaruddin further said, ""Pakistan's practice of using false pretences to distract from addressing the malaise that afflicts it has run its course. We hope that Pakistan pays heed to the clear signals sent out here today and focusses on the hard tasks it has to address in order to ensure normal relations with India.""

Coming out of the meeting, Chinese ambassador Zhang Jun said: ""We had a meeting on Jammu and Kashmir. And I'm sure you all know that foreign minister of Pakistan wrote letters to the Security Council asking it to pay attention to the current situation in Jammu and kashmir. ""The issue of India and Pakistan has always been on the agenda of the Security Council and today we have also seen some tensions, so the Security Council had a briefing and (it) heard at the briefing from the secretariat concerning the current situation on the ground. Members exchanged views on that."" Zhang later said China has stated its ""position very clearly. We remain concerned about the situation on the ground (in Kashmir)."" When asked if the meeting advanced anything, he said: ""I am sure the meeting will help both the parties to understand the risk of further escalation and will encourage them to approach each other and have a dialogue and seek solutions through dialogue. I think that will be helpful."" The current move by China was the third such attempt to raise the Kashmir issue in the UNSC since August last when the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was scrapped by the government, and the state was bifurcated into two union territories. In August,   China pushed for a UNSC meeting on Kashmir   . However, the meeting did not yield desired results for China as the member-states maintained that India's move was an internal issue. Last month, France, the US, the UK and Russia foiled an attempt by China to discuss Kashmir at a closed-door meeting of the UNSC.

 Centre should produce record of development works in J&amp;K after abrogation of Article 370: Tarigami | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Senior CPM leader M Y Tarigami on Thursday slammed the BJP-led Central government for making ""big claims"" on development works in Jammu and Kashmir, charging that people were not even getting basic amenities. The Centre should produce a record of the development it has carried out in Jammu and Kashmir since abrogation of Article 370, he demanded. ""At a time when the BJP government at the Centre is making big claims of development, people in Kashmir are hankering for basic amenities including LPG, ration and other essential commodities. Even in rural areas of Jammu the situation is no different,"" he said in a statement. Tarigami said snow has not been cleared from roads in Kashmir and there is a crisis of drinking water. ""These are the ground realities which can't be brushed aside. The reality is that the only thing achieved by this BJP government so far is highly divisive and discriminatory measures like CAA, NRC and NPR which have created a lot of uncertainty in the country"", he charged. He said the Supreme Court may have declared the Internet blackout impermissible, but the Jammu and Kashmir administration seems to have found a way to ""circumvent"" the verdict and retain most restrictions in the Valley. Tarigami charged that the J&K administration's answer in response to the apex court's order is a mere eyewash. Not a single minister visited Kashmir when heavy snowfall in early November destroyed the apple crop and also caused massive damage to apple trees as well, he said. He said in Jammu farmers suffered losses due to heavy rains and the Centre didn't even bother to send a junior minister for assessment of the losses. ""Even till now the assessment of losses to apple and saffron industry and losses to farming community in Jammu has not been done properly"", he alleged. Lashing out at the Centre, he said a little over five months have passed since the Central government ""arbitrarily abrogated Article 370 claiming that Articles 35A and 370 hinder development in J&K"". ""Now let them produce a record on how much development has happened since then? Where is the investment and job opportunities which the BJP has been claiming will come after the revocation of J&K's special status?"", he added. Forget about creating new employment opportunities, there is an apprehension among people that now even class IV posts in J&K will be filled at the all-India level, he said. Tarigami said the national highway connecting Kashmir with rest of the country has remained closed for more days than it is open which has created scarcity of essential commodities in the Valley. ""The BJP, which is in power for the last almost six years, has not been able to repair a patch from Ramban to Ramsu on the national highway.

" Maya names first-time MP, a Brahmin, as BSP’s LS chief | India News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Making the fifth change in the leadership of her party in Lok Sabha in less than a year, BSP chief Mayawati has now appointed first time MP Ritesh Pandey (38), a foreign educated Brahmin from Ambedkarnagar, to head the party in the lower house. Pandey has replaced Danish Ali, who joined BSP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and was being perceived as the party’s Muslim face. While announcing Pandey’s appointment, Mayawati said that since a Muslim was already heading BSP’s state unit, she needed to give representation to other communities. Incidentally, with Pandey’s appointment, two Brahmins are now heading the party in Parliament — Ritesh Pandey in Lok Sabha and SC Mishra in Rajya Sabha. Ali’s removal, his second since August, comes in an apparent bid to ensure “equal representation” of all communities within BSP, though sources in the party said Mayawati was unhappy with his frequent challenging of her hold over the party. “To bring about social equality in BSP, we have had to make some changes in the party since the Lok Sabha leader and UP state president are both from the same community. Ritesh Pandey is now the leader of the party in Lok Sabha while Malook Nagar is the deputy leader. BSP state president Munqad Ali will remain in his position,” Mayawati said. Ali, who was earlier the Janata Dal (Secular) general secretary in Karnataka, has experienced a rocky ride in BSP.

The public contact is also intended to signal to people that they are being accorded priority and the government is serious about accelerating development work.

 J&amp;K cites terror threat as reason to not resume internet in Kashmir Valley | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: The J&K administration has cited possible misuse of the internet by anti-national elements and terrorists as a reason for not restoring these services for the general public and media in the Kashmir Valley. Complying with the Supreme Court's directions issued on January 10, the union territory's administration on Tuesday evening ordered restoration of 2G mobile internet services on postpaid connections in five districts of Jammu division and broadband facilities in both Jammu and Kashmir divisions only for institutions dealing with essential services and tourism, such as hospitals, banks and hotels. The order, issued by principal secretary, home, Shaleen Kabra late on Tuesday, however, did not restore mobile internet services for Kashmir division. It said misuse of data services by anti-national elements has the potential to cause large-scale violence and disturb public order ""which has till now been maintained due to various pre-emptive measures, including restrictions on access to internet with relaxations in a calibrated and gradual manner, after due consideration of the ground situation"". Kabra said the police authorities have brought to notice material relating to the terror modules operating in the union territory, including handlers from across the border, and activities of separatists and anti-national elements within, who are attempting to aid and incite people by transmission of fake news and targeted messages through use of internet to propagate terrorism, indulge in rumour-mongering, support fallacious proxy wars, spread propaganda and cause disaffection and discontent. ""Based on intelligence inputs and assessment of law and order situation obtained on the ground, law enforcement agencies, while dealing with the present situation, have inter-alia reported about sustained efforts being made by terrorists to infiltrate from across the border, re-activate their cadres and scale up anti-national activities in Kashmir division as well as terrorism-affected areas of Jammu division, by communicating effectively with their operatives within the UT of J&K through VOIP and encrypted mobile communication through various social media applications to coordinate and plan terror acts,"" the order said. ""... it is absolutely necessary to do so (restrict access to internet) in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the Security of the State and for maintaining public order,"" it said. Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir have been suspended since August 5, when abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution was announced. The authorities have continued to describe the restrictions as a pre-emptive measure to prevent misuse of data services by anti-national elements which has the potential to cause large-scale violence and disturb public order. Tuesday's order directed the internet service providers (ISPs) in the Kashmir Valley to provide limited broadband facility to essential services, such as hospitals, banks and government offices, and hotels and tour and travel establishments. There is no mention of the services being restored to media organisations or to the general public in the Valley. ""ISPs to provide broadband facility, with Mac-binding, to all the institutions dealing with essential services, hospitals, banks, etc as also government offices, and in order to facilitate tourism, to hotels and tour and travel establishments,"" Kabra said in the order. He asked the ISPs to install necessary firewalls and carry out 'white-listing' of sites that would enable access to government websites and websites dealing with essential services, e-banking, etc. However, access to all social media sites has been banned in both Jammu and Kashmir divisions. ""...there shall be complete restriction on social media applications allowing peer to peer communication and virtual private networking applications for the time being,"" the order read. The principal secretary, home department, also directed the government offices and the institutions being provided internet access to take necessary precautions to prevent its misuse. ""They shall be responsible to prevent any misuse, for which they shall take all the necessary precautions, including appointment of nodal officers, keeping a record of persons/ devices, managing and monitoring day to day usage, changing accessibility credentials on a daily basis and ensure internet availability to only authorised users, etc,"" it said. The order also directed the divisional administration of Kashmir to establish 400 more internet kiosks to facilitate the general public, students, traders for filing GST returns, and tourists – a sign that internet services were unlikely to be restored in the Valley anytime soon.

" 1984 anti-Sikh riots: Accepted SIT recommendations, will take action, Centre tells SC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Centre Wednesday told the Supreme Court they have accepted the recommendations of a special investigation team (SIT), headed by retired Delhi high court judge Justice S N Dhingra which has probed 186 cases of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, and they will take appropriate action as per the laws. A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was informed by senior advocate R S Suri, appearing for the petitioner, that the report of the SIT is damning for police officials and they would file application seeking action against the cops who were allegedly involved in the ghastly crime. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that they have accepted the recommendations made in the report and they will take appropriate steps. ""We have accepted the recommendations and we will act accordingly as per law. Lot of steps are required to be taken and it will be taken,"" Mehta told the bench, also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant. During the hearing, Suri referred to the SIT's report and said the ""undercurrent is that police officials can't go scot-free for the things which had happened"". ""The report suggests that some action should be taken against police officials as they were in connivance. These police officials cannot go scot free. We will file a response to the report,"" Suri told the bench and added that he will also file an application seeking action against police officials. The bench was informed by Mehta that the records of these cases are kept in the apex court registry and they should be returned to the CBI so that further proceedings can go on. The bench directed that the records be given to the ministry of home affairs. The SIT, also comprising retired IPS officer Rajdeep Singh and serving IPS officer Abhishek Dular, was set up by the apex court on Janaury 11, 2018 to supervise further investigation into 186 cases in which closure reports were filed earlier. The SIT presently has only two members as Singh had declined to be part of the team on personal grounds. Earlier, in March last year, the top court had granted two more months to the SIT to complete its probe into 186 riot cases after the SIT informed it that more than 50 per cent of work was done and it wanted two more months to complete the investigation. Large-scale riots targeting members of the Sikh community had broken out in the national capital in the aftermath of the assassination of the then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh security guards on the morning of October 31, 1984. The violence had claimed 2,733 lives in Delhi alone. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"Top US Senator urges Pompeo to 'press' India for 'swift reversal' of CAA, NRC - Times of India","WASHINGTON: A top US Senator has urged secretary of state Mike Pompeo to press the Indian government for a ""swift reversal"" of the amended Citizenship Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens to ensure protection of human rights of all persons in the country regardless of their religion. In a letter to Pompeo on Tuesday, Senator Bob Menendez, a Ranking Member of the powerful senate foreign relations committee, expressed concern over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the potential for the establishment of a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) in India. Asserting that the US must remain steadfast in defending democratic values, freedoms and human rights, he said, ""I urge the administration to engage the Indian government at the highest levels on these concerns, press for a swift reversal of these policies and practices, and ensure protection of the human rights of all persons in India regardless of their religion."" According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship. ""The law to grant citizenship based on religion violates India's international legal obligations and its constitution, which guarantees the rights to equality and nondiscrimination,"" Menendez said. ""The citizen registry has already disproportionately affected Muslims in India. These efforts threaten India's long history of secularism and democratic values,"" claimed the Democrat leader who represents New Jersey, which has among the highest concentration of Indian-Americans in the US. ""Despite the government's claims that the Citizenship Bill seeks to protect religious minorities, its failure to include Muslim groups facing persecution in neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan's Ahmadiyya and Burma's Rohingya, signal an anti-Muslim intent,"" wrote the senator. Menendez also expressed concerns over reports of injuries and deaths of peaceful demonstrators protesting the CAA and the proposed nationwide NRC. Referring to the NRC, the senator said in October last year, he had travelled to India during which he met with civil society activists who expressed deep concern about the ""trajectory of these policies and its negative impact on the future of democracy in India"". ""The government's efforts in Assam has left effectively 1.9 million persons, primarily Bengali-speaking Muslims, stateless. The government appears to now be extending this effort across the country,"" he said. The NRC exercise was conducted in Assam on the directions of the Supreme Court. Though several union ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah, have often pitched for a nationwide NRC exercise, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month had said that his government has never discussed the NRC since coming to power for the first time in 2014 and it was done only in Assam due to a Supreme Court order. On the CAA, Modi said the law is about giving rights to persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries and does not snatch anybody's rights. In his letter to Pompeo, Senator Menendez also expressed concerns on the situation in Kashmir. ""The situation in Kashmir has also not normalised since the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution in August. The five-month Internet shutdown in Kashmir is the longest ever in a democracy, and has left people's lives, jobs, and the economy in a more dire situation,"" he said. Following the abrogation of Article 370, which ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into two union territories, various restrictions -- including ban on mobile phones and Internet -- were imposed in Jammu and Kashmir to maintain law and order. The Indian government has defended the restrictions, which are being gradually lifted in a phased manner, on the grounds that they were imposed to prevent Pakistan from creating more mischief through proxies and terrorists following the abrogation of Article 370.

" Broadband, 2G internet partially restored in J&amp;K | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Tuesday evening allowed mobile Internet in parts of Jammu region and broadband in establishments providing essential services, days after the Supreme Court ordered a review of the curbs imposed in the Union Territory. The order comes into effect from January 15 and shall remain in force for seven days, a government communication said. In a three-page order, the administration asked Internet service providers to offer broadband facility (with Mac binding) to all institutions dealing with essential services such as hospitals, banks and government offices. In order to facilitate tourism, the broadband internet services would be provided to hotels and tour and travel establishments, the order said. Mac Binding essentially means to enforce a client machine to work from a particular Internet Protocol address. ""Prior to giving such facility, the service providers have been asked to install necessary firewalls and carry out white-listing of sites that would enable government websites and website dealing with essential services like e-banking,"" the order said. However, all social media sites remain out of bounds. ""There shall be complete restrictions on social media applications allowing peer-to-peer communication and virtual private network applications for the time being,"" the order said. The institutions and government offices that are being provided internet access shall be responsible to prevent misuse, according to the order. It said the 2G mobile connectivity on post-paid mobiles for accessing white-listed websites including e-banking will be allowed in districts of Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Reasi -- all in the Jammu region. The order said that the police has brought material relating to the terror modules operating in Jammu and Kashmir including handlers from across the border who are attempting to aid and incite people by transmission of fake news and targeted messages through use of internet. The relaxation came days after the Supreme Court said access to the Internet is a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution. The SC verdict had come on Friday on a batch of pleas challenging the curbs imposed in Jammu and Kashmir after the Centre's abrogation of provisions of Article 370 on August 5 last year. The court had also asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration to review within a week all orders imposing curbs in the Union Territory. It had asked the J&K administration to restore internet services in institutions such as hospitals and educational places providing essential services. The J&K administration's Tuesday communication said that in view of the Supreme Court directions, the situation has been reviewed and Internet has been opened whereever it was possible keeping in view the security consideration. In Kashmir, 400 additional Internet kiosks will be established, besides the 900 terminals which are already operational in the Valley. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" BJP, Congress spar over whether DSP had link to Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday demanded that the government probe whether Jammu and Kashmir police officer Davinder Singh had any role in last year’s Pulwama terror attack, suggesting a political nexus, prompting BJP to hit back demanding that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi explain who was behind the attack if not Pakistan. Singh was posted in Pulwama and Congress’s allegations take into account his name figuring in claims regarding the 2001 Parliament attack and he was also in the frame during the recent visit of foreign envoys to J&K. With Congress claiming a “larger conspiracy”, BJP asked it to explain if it had doubts on who was behind the Pulwama terror attack. “I want to ask Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi if they have any doubt about perpetrators of the Pulwama attack. If you believe Pakistan was not behind it, then you should tell us clearly as to who were involved,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said. Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury sought to target RSS and said, “Had Davinder Singh by default been Davindar Khan, the reaction of troll regiment of RSS would have been more strident and vociferous. Enemies of our country ought to be condemned, irrespective of colour, creed, and religion.” Patra accused Congress of linking religion to terror attacks to target Hindus and said the party had a history of doing so. Congress leaders had invented terms like “saffron terror” and “Hindu terror” and had linked RSS to the Mumbai terror attacks, he said. Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, “For how long has Davinder Singh been acting as a conduit for J&K terrorists? What is his connection, if at all, to the 2001 Parliament attack? What is his connection to the Pulwama attack where over 42 jawans lost their lives and where Singh was DSP?” Congress dismissed the police claim that Singh was bringing two terrorists in his car to Delhi for Rs 12 lakh on January 11. “This story is preposterous. There is a larger conspiracy. At whose instance was Singh bringing terrorists to Delhi? Are there any people in echelons of power who are involved with him? Is there a larger conspiracy, is he only a small pawn or a carrier in the larger conspiracy?” Surjewala asked. Rejecting the Congress charge, Patra said, “Congress is best at attacking India and defending and protecting Pakistan.” Pakistani PM Imran Khan and LeT chief Hafiz Saeed would soon be praising Congress for its statements, he said, recalling that Pakistan had used Rahul’s remarks in its plea in the UN on Article 370.

Addressing a rally here organized in support of the contentious legislation, the firebrand BJP leader asserted that the CAA is about granting citizenship and not taking it away and in no way linked to NRC, which was an exercise undertaken in Assam at the instance of the Supreme Court. Lavishing praise on the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its ""decisiveness"" in dealing with issues like triple talaq, Article 370 and the CAA, Yogi said this had ""forced those who sought to rule by fatwas, without any regard for the Constitution, shut their shop"".

""The abrogation of Article 370 is a step further in the direction and today Pakistan is living in the fear that it may lose even PoK to India"", the BJP leader said evoking wild applause from the crowds. He said India has the age-old tradition of giving shelter to those who seek refuge, but driving out infiltrators. This is what CAA is all about.

 India asks Pakistan to return its rake used in Samjhauta Express | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India has asked Pakistan to return the Samjhauta Express rake lying at Wagah for the past five months, following the suspension of train services due to tense relations between the two countries after nullification of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Tuesday. Railway officials said the ministry of external affairs has already conveyed the request to Islamabad. ""On our (Railways) request, the MEA has asked Pakistan authorities to return our rake as soon as possible,"" a senior railway official told PTI. The rakes were last used on August 8, 2019 when Pakistan stopped the Samjhauta Express at the Wagah border leaving nearly 117 passengers stranded, citing security concerns after the nullification of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. The train, that was scheduled to reach Attari at 12.30 pm finally arrived on the Indian side at 5.15 pm after Indian Railways sent its engine, crew and security to bring the train and its passengers from Wagah border to Attari. The two countries take turns of six month each to use their rakes for the Samjhauta Express. Rakes belonging to Pakistan are used from January to June while Indian rakes are used from July to December. Usually, the rakes are returned to the home country the same day or after an overnight stay. This is the first time that a rake was stranded on either side for a period of five months. Samjhauta Express, which started in July 1976 to improve people-to-people connect between the two countries after the Simla Agreement, has been stopped whenever relations between India and Pakistan got strained. The train named after the Hindi word for ""agreement"", comprises six sleeper coaches and an AC 3-tier coach. The train service was started on July 22, 1976 under the Simla Agreement that settled the 1971 war between the two nations. Pakistani authorities briefly suspended the train service on February 28, 2019 following tensions in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF soldiers were killed. The train operates from Attari twice a week – Mondays and Thursdays. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Sabarimala will get precedence, CAA and Article 370 can wait: Supreme Court | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday indicated that adjudication of the faith vs fundamental rights issue arising from women’s entry into the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple and mosques would take precedence over hearing of petitions challenging the validity of Citizenship (Amendment) Act and scrapping of J&K ’s special status under Article 370. The bench, headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, said, “Sabarimala is a older problem and it will be decided first. CAA and Article 370 issue pending before other benches will be decided later.” The CJI’s observation came when senior advocates Indira Jaising and Rajeev Dhavan said deferring the hearing on faith vs fundamental rights issue could clash with the hearing on petitions challenging CAA and scrapping of J&K’s special status, both pending before different benches, and make it difficult for advocates who are also engaged to argue the latter two issues. A bench headed by the CJI had entertained a large number of petitions challenging the validity of CAA and had asked the Centre to file its response by January 22, the next date of hearing. A five-judge bench headed by Justice N V Ramana was scheduled to resume hearing on January 21 on a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the Centre’s August 5 decision to strip J&K of its special status under Article 370 and divide it into two UTs.

" ‘CAA, move on Article 370 will not hurt tourist footfalls in J&amp;K’ | India News - Times of India","A new tourism policy has been in the works for a long time, what progress has been made on it?Once our advisory board is set up, we want to hold a brainstorming session to discuss everything threadbare before finalising anything. Agendas change from time to time. For instance, adventure tourism has changed. This was an area neither formally part of tourism, nor of sports. Over 120 peaks were thrown open for adventure tourism and we need security norms in place as well as infrastructural support. I feel the entire process is likely to take up to a year to complete. Do you think it is time now for India to set up a tourism marketing board, which takes a 360 degree view of promoting India in the domestic market and abroad?I believe India has everything that the world does not have — biodiversity, heritage and culture. Despite this, if people don’t come, we need to have a transparent mechanism to understand why they don’t come to India. I started to engage with people on Twitter to understand this and people told me to expect criticism. But in eight months, I have not faced criticism. We resolved hoteliers’ concerns over high GST rates, duration for e-visa increased and new peaks were opened. As far as marketing is concerned, I don’t think we need a separate board. The US is among countries to have issued a travel advisory as India witnesses protests over CAA and NRC. How is the government planning to manage the negative perception?I believe this is the result of a planned conspiracy against us. We can improve perception when we are at fault. But if outside forces are conspiring against us to malign our image, we need to consider this carefully. I believe they (those issuing advisories) have not seen India. Leh-Ladakh bore the brunt of this advisory even though it is a separate Union Territory and there was no violence there. The advisory belatedly mentioned Leh was a separate region. I also want to point out that there is a lot of misinformation about the internet clampdown in Kashmir. The only thing stopped is mobile internet, which terrorists can use. Outside, though, the perception is that everything is in abeyance. What about the northeast? Travel operators said tourist footfalls have dipped in the northeast due to protests over CAA-NRC and in Kashmir after the Article 370 decision.Northeast is fine. We even held the ITM in Imphal (November 2019). It is wrong to say that abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370 had anything to do with this. I do not agree with this. You said in Parliament that tourists footfalls in J&K have declined.See, there are two parts to this. When this subject comes up, figures are bandied about like they are massive. In reality, please see the actual figures of international tourist arrivals in Jammu & Kashmir. Not just international tourists, but tourists in general.The maximum number of people who visit J&K are those who go to Vaishno Devi and Amarnath. The Amarnath Yatra was suspended days before the decision (on Article 370) was taken. If you look at the total figures of tourists going to J&K in percentage terms, I don’t think there is a remarkable change. At least in terms of actual footfalls, I don’t see a remarkable decline. Any measures to improve footfalls in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh?The responsibility of improving the perception of a place has to be shouldered by everyone. Even if you and I are given free tickets to travel to Iran right now, no one will go. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Article 370: India hopeful of winning support of Democrats on Jammu and Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: While several Republicans in the US have publicly backed India's decision to revoke the special status of what was the state of J&K, many 'moderate' Democrat Congressmen too have reached out to the Indian government and have expressed understanding of India's position, according to senior Indian government sources. These Congressmen, said an official, are reluctant to speak out in public because of the 'ultra left-liberal flank' of the Democratic Party. The six Congressmen to have spoken so far for India are all Republicans. ""The moderate elements within the Democratic Party, even if privately, have shown serious understanding of not just India’s position that the decision to amend Article 370 was meant to ensure economic opportunities and social justice but also the fact that Pakistan was exploiting the separatist sentiment in some areas of the Valley for perpetrating cross-border terrorism,"" claimed a senior official. Many top Democrats, including presidential hopefuls like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have publicly expressed concern about the situation in J&K. While Sanders had described India’s actions as unacceptable, Warren had called for India to show respect for the rights of Kashmiri people. After the Indian mission outreach led by ambassador Harsh Vardhan Shringla, official sources said, more Congressmen are said to be considering making statements in support of India’s position. Shringla returns to India this week to take charge as foreign secretary later this month. Congressman Scott Perry last week became the 6th leader from the Republican Party to express support for India on the J&K issue. Perry is a 4th-term Congressman from Pennsylvania and is a member of important House Committees like Foreign Affairs and Transportation & Infrastructure. “I stand with India in their aspiration to provide equal economic, social, and political opportunities to all citizens. As part of this pursuit, two-thirds of the Indian Parliament voted last year to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir. This vote allowed the government of India to address the stagnant economy and high youth unemployment plaguing the region by providing economic opportunity and sound governance. The residents of Jammu and Kashmir have battled economic depression and forces of extremism and radicalization for too long. The regional stability now provided by government will give residents of Jammu and Kashmir a better way forward and hope for the future,"" Perry was quoted as having said. In March, 2019, Perry had introduced a resolution in the House to condemn the Pulwama terror attack. Other Congressmen who have publicly backed India include Francis Rooney and Joe Wilson, both members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Speaking in the House, Wilson had said that India’s decision was meant to ""boost economic development, fight corruption and end gender, caste and religious discrimination"". Congressmen Pete Olson, Paul Gosar and George Holding are the three others who have endorsed India’s position in public. The first Congressman to issue a statement on J&K, Holding had said that while Article 370 might have worked well for 'those with political connections,’ it denied economic opportunities for the people and that it also created a polarizing environment that was exploited politically. ""These are all very influential people in their own right. Holding is a member of House Ways and Means Committee which is the oldest committee of the US Congress. Gosar is the Chair of the House Committee on natural resources,"" said the official. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

""Some students raised anti-India slogans, `Bharat tere tukde honge ek hazar, Inshallah Inshallah' at JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University). They must be put in jail (or not). Those who would raise anti-national slogans will be sent behind the bars,"" said Shah while addressing a rally at Garrison ground in Jabalpur as part of BJP's outreach programme to create awareness on CAA. The BJP leader also challenged the Congress to stop the construction of Ram temple. He dared the Congress and said, ""Whether Ram temple should be constructed or not? Congress leader and advocate Kapil Sibal said Ram temple should not be constructed. Sibal (bhai), stop it if you can. A sky-high Ram temple is going to come up within next four months."" The BJP president also challenged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee to point out a single provision in the law which can take away any Indian's citizenship. Shah said Congress and opposition parties are misleading the nation on CAA and instigating minorities. ""I challenge Mamata Banerjee and Rahul Baba, to find out a single provision in CAA that can take citizenship away from anyone in this country. After Independence, the Congress divided the country on the basis of religion. The Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Jain, who lived in both East and West Pakistan wanted to return, but they stayed because of the bloodshed. The leaders of our country had assured them that they will be welcomed here and given the citizenship whenever they want,"" said Shah. Justifying CAA, Shah said, ""After partition, there were 30% Hindus in both East and West Pakistan. Today, there are just 3% Hindus in Pakistan and 7% Hindus in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). I want to ask the blind and deaf Congress leaders, where the Hindus, Sikh, Sindhi brothers have gone. Where the Machhua (fishermen) of Bangladesh have vanished."" ""Mahatma Gandhi had said they were the citizens of India. When they want to return, they would be welcomed here. The then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had also promised to give them Indian citizenship but Congress is running away from the promise. We will do everything for them. Those who were being tormented will be rehabilitated here. Congress should open its ears and listen. Do whatever you can. We will give citizenship to all of them,"" Shah emphasised. The home minister also raised the issue of Human Rights violations in Pakistan and said,"" Atrocities are being committed in Pakistan on minorities. Attack on Gurudwara Nanakana Sahib, where they kidnapped the daughter of Granthi (ceremonial reader of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib). What is happening there. Why Congress not raising this matter."" Shah also quoted the election manifesto of Rajasthan Congress which promises to provide citizenship to Hindus and Sikhs arrived from Pakistan. ""Before assembly elections in Rajasthan, the Congress in its poll manifesto promised in point number 34, to provide citizenship to Hindus and Sikhs coming from Pakistan. Now the Congress is refusing. The party is misleading the public. I would like to assure that there is no provision of taking back the citizenship of any Indian citizen,"" he said. Making a scathing attack on Congress, he said, ""The Congress and company are propagating lies. How Mamata Banerjee, Kejriwal and Rahul Baba are spreading false information, we will tell them (public). We will contact more than three crore people under the awareness drive. The BJP has committed to finish some tasks since 1950. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji has completed those tasks,"" claimed Shah. Taking on the Congress for opposing every move taken by the BJP-led NDA government, he said, ""Congress is opposing every decision, from Article 370, 35 A, to Ram temple, triple talaq, surgical strike, air strike, when we hit Pakistan in its own land, and now citizenship law. For vote bank politics, Congress is singing the tune of Pakistan and Imran on every issue. I would suggest that Congress should return from the wrong path. The party should understand the feelings of the public else, you (Congress) will be completely wiped out,"" said Shah. The BJP president also hit out at Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath for his refusal to implement CAA. Shah said, ""Nath denied to implement CAA during a Congress rally in New Delhi. He should not talk loud. Instead, he should focus on MP. The state has already been handed over to liquor and sand mafia. We are searching for Gaushalas in MP as promised by the Congress but, could not see single. The farmers who have been cheated in the name of loan waiver are demanding bonus on wheat. If you have enough strength then come on the (election) ground. Public makes mistake once, not every time. We will trounce you by two-third majority,"" claimed Amit Shah.

 Political parties welcome SC verdict on curbs in J&amp;K | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Mainstream political parties in J&K on Friday welcomed the Supreme Court order, directing the newly formed Union Territory administration to review within one week all restrictive orders, including those curbing civil liberties and internet access, in place since the Centre nullified Articles 370 and 35A that granted special status to the former state. While National Conference termed the ruling “significant”, Mehbooba Mufti’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP) said the top court calling the curbs “abuse of power” reinstated its faith in the judiciary. CPI leader Yousuf Tarigami, on the other hand, called the verdict “remarkable” and praised the highest court for issuing the direction to the J&K government to review the curbs. “The observations of the apex court about snapping of internet services indefinitely are significant and the government must take a call to review and restore the connectivity immediately,” NC’s provincial president Devender Singh Rana said. Rana hoped the restoration of mobile internet would go a long way in easing out the situation, saying the curbs had taken a heavy toll on the youth in their pursuit of career advancement as also on the academic odyssey of a vast mass of students. The tourism trade had also taken a big hit while businesses too had suffered hugely, he maintained. The NC leader also stressed the need for reaching out to the alienated people of J&K in order to heighten their aspirations. PDP tweeted from its official handle: “Finally #SupremeCourt has woken up to the injustices cast upon the people of J&K, calling such government lodged curbs an ‘abuse’ of power reinstates our faith in the judiciary.” Ever since PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti has been in detention, her daughter Iltija Mufti has been handling the party’s Twitter handle. Tarigami said the apex court’s verdict would help settle the issue of civil liberties in J&K. “This remarkable verdict even restrains the government from imposing such restrictions in future without any plausible reason,” he added. Former PDP minister Altaf Bukhari, who was expelled from the party in 2018, welcomed the top court’s order. Issuing a statement, Bukhari, who is currently trying to form an alternative to the present regional political parties, said the apex court verdict has given a sigh of relief to the people of J&K, who have tremendously suffered because of communication blockade in last over five months. “The Supreme Court verdict vis-a-vis restoration of fundamental rights of the citizens of J&K assumes much significance given the scale of loss suffered by the people — especially in education, health and business sectors — due to the continuous internet shutdown,” Bukhari said.

" Freedom of speech, right to business through Internet constitutionally protected: SC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Expressing oneself through the medium of Internet is an integral part of fundamental right to speech and expression under Article 19 of the Constitution and any restrictions imposed on it should be reasonable, the Supreme Court on Friday held. The top court said that right of trade and commerce through Internet is also constitutionally protected subject to reasonable restrictions. It said that complete blocking or prohibition cannot be accepted by the court and achievement of peace and tranquillity within the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir requires a multi-faceted approach without excessively burdening the right to freedom of speech. A bench of justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai said, ""We declare that the freedom of speech and expression and the freedom to practice any profession or carry on any trade, business or occupation over the medium of internet enjoys constitutional protection under Article 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression) and Article 19(1)(g) (right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business)."" The bench said the restriction upon such fundamental rights should be in consonance with the mandate under Article 19 (2) and (6) of the Constitution, inclusive of the test of proportionality. It added that in today's world the internet stands as the most utilised and accessible medium for exchange of information but there is a consistent criticism that the development of technology is not met by equivalent movement in the law. The bench said in a catena of judgments, the apex court has recognised free speech as a fundamental right and ""expression through the Internet has gained contemporary relevance and is one of the major means of information diffusion."" Dealing with trade and commerce over Internet, the bench said that the globalisation of the Indian economy and the rapid advances in information and technology have opened up vast business avenues and transformed India as a global IT hub. ""There is no doubt that there are certain trades which are completely dependent on the Internet. Such a right of trade through Internet also fosters consumerism and availability of choice. Therefore, the freedom of trade and commerce through the medium of the Internet is also constitutionally protected,"" it said. The top court's verdict came on a plea of Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, Kashmir Times editor Anuradha Bhasin and others who challenged the restrictions imposed in Jammu and Kashmir post August 5, last year decision of Centre abrogating Article 370. They had contended that the restrictions under Article 19 of the Constitution cannot mean complete prohibition. ""In this context we may note that the contention cannot be sustained in light of a number of judgments of this court wherein the restriction has also been held to include complete prohibition in appropriate cases,"" it said. Referring to the situation of Jammu and Kashmir, the bench said that erstwhile state has been a hot bed of terrorist insurgencies for many years. Noting the J&K's submission, the top court said that since 1990 to 2019 there have been 71,038 recorded incidents of terrorist violence, 14,038 civilians have died, 5292 security personnel were martyred, 22,536 terrorists were killed. It added that modern terrorism heavily relies on the internet and the operations do not require substantial expenditure, are not traceable easily and the internet is being used to support fallacious proxy wars by raising money, recruiting and spreading propaganda/ideologies. The top court there is no doubt on power of government to restrict under the Constitution but the question is about the extent, the degree of restriction and scope both territorially and temporally which must stand in relation to what is actually necessary to combat an emergent situation. It said that doctrine of proportionality must be followed by the authorities before passing any order intending on restricting fundamental rights of individuals and they must assess the existence of any alternative mechanism. ""It is undeniable that only the least restrictive measure can be resorted to by the State, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances. Lastly, since the order has serious implications on the fundamental rights of the affected parties, the same should be supported by sufficient material and should be amenable to judicial review,"" it said. The top court rejected the contention of J&K administration that they lack technology for providing selective internet access saying if the said argument is accepted then the government would have a free pass to put a complete internet blockage every time. ""Such complete blocking/prohibition perpetually cannot be accepted by this Court,"" it said, adding, ""a decision which curtails fundamental rights without appropriate justification will be classified as disproportionate"". It accepted the contention of Jammu and Kashmir that the internet could be used to propagate terrorism thereby challenging the sovereignty and integrity of India. ""This court would only observe that achievement of peace and tranquillity within the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir requires a multi-faceted approach without excessively burdening the freedom of speech,"" it said.

Quoting the famous opening paragraph of Charles Dickens' novel, 'A Tale of Two Cities', a bench headed by Justice N V Ramana said Jammu and Kashmir has been a hot bed of terrorist insurgencies for many years. ""Although cherished in our heart as a 'Paradise on Earth', the history of this beautiful land is etched with violence and militancy. While the mountains of Himalayas spell tranquillity, yet blood is shed every day. ""In this land of inherent contradictions, these petitions (filed to remove restrictions) add to the list, wherein two sides have shown two different pictures which are diametrically opposite and factually irreconcilable. ""In this context, this Court's job is compounded by the magnitude of the task before it. It goes without saying that this Court will not delve into the political propriety of the decision taken herein, which is best left for democratic forces to act on,"" the apex court said. ""Our limited scope is to strike a balance between the liberty and security concerns so that the right to life is secured and enjoyed in the best possible manner,"" it said. The bench also comprising justices B R Gavai and R Subhash Reddy noted the Centre's submission that since 1990 to 2019, there have been 32,71,038 recorded incidents of terrorist violence in which 14,038 civilians have died, 5,292 security personnel were martyred and 22,536 terrorists were killed. ""The geopolitical struggle cannot be played down or ignored. In line with the aforesaid requirement, we may note that even the broadest guarantee of free speech would not protect the entire gamut of speech.

In its verdict, the apex court said that freedom of speech and conducting business on the Internet are protected under the Constitution, while directing the Jammu and Kashmir administration to immediately review curb orders.

Supreme Court verdict on Jammu and Kashmir internet ban gives fresh ammo to opposition parties to target govt | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court order on Internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir provided fresh ammunition to opposition leaders for renewed offensive against the government as they hailed the judgment as a ""rebuff to the unconstitutional and arrogant"" regime and which ""belies false claims of normalcy"" in the newly-carved out union territory. A five-judge bench of the apex court declared Internet as a fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression and asked the administration of the UT to review within a week all orders imposing curbs in Jammu and Kashmir, including the 160-day-old net ban. Terming the order as a ""big-jolt"" to the central government, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said truth cannot be hidden any longer in ""sealed envelops"" and added that the apex court expressed displeasure over the Modi government's refusal to show its orders on Internet ban which was an ""extraordinary measure"". In a tweet, he said the Supreme Court had delivered ""first big jolt of 2020 to illegal activities of Modi government by stating importance of internet as a fundamental right. Double shock for Modi-Shah that dissent cannot be oppressed by imposing section 144. ""Modiji reminded that nation bows before Constitution and not him!"" Party colleague and former home minister P Chidambaram termed the apex order as a rebuff to the ""unconstitutional and arrogant"" stance of the central government and asked former state governor Satpal Malik to own responsibility and resign as Goa governor. ""SC order is a rebuff to the unconstitutional and arrogant stance of the central government and the J&K administration on the restrictions imposed in J&K,"" he said. ""The former governor of J&K, Mr Satpal Malik, should own responsibility and resign from his present post of Governor, Goa,"" Chidambaram said in a series of tweets. In J&K, main opposition National Conference welcomed the order and expressed hope that restoration of mobile Internet services will help ease the situation. ""The observations of the apex court about snapping of Internet services indefinitely are significant and the government must take a call to review and restore the connectivity immediately,"" NC provincial president Devender Singh Rana said here. PDP, an ally of the BJP till 2018, welcomed the order and said that the apex court has ""finally"" woken up ""to the injustices cast upon the people of J&K.

He said the ""verdict vis-a-vis restoration of fundamental rights of citizens of Jammu and Kashmir assumes much significance given the scale of loss suffered by the people especially in education, health and business sectors due to the continuous internet shutdown"". Echoing similar views, the CPM said the judgement belied the false claims of normalcy that the central government has been peddling to the country and the world. ""The Supreme Court has made significant comments on the curbs on civil liberties in Jammu and Kashmir which belie the false claims of normalcy that the central government has been peddling to the country and the world,"" it said. It further said that the government tried to reinforce the official claims of normalcy by taking a group of foreign envoys on a farcical restricted tour to J&K where they were ""allowed to see and hear only what the government wanted them to, which is why none of them could meet the three former chief ministers still in jail."" ""When five months after the lockdown, political leaders, MPs and parties representing the people of this country are virtually banned from visiting Kashmir, such a tour is insulting to India's parliament,"" the Left party said. Leader of the opposition in Rajya Sabha and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad hailed the order saying the government had tried to mislead the people and this time the apex court did not come under any pressure. ""We welcome this judgement. This is the first time SC has talked about how people of J&K feel. I would like to thank the SC for a very historic decision and the people from across the country were waiting for it, especially the people of J&K,"" he said, adding ""the government has misled the entire country.

"‘SAD failed its ideology on CAA, Article 370 abrogation’ | Chandigarh News - Times of India","CHANDIGARH: Punjab former finance minister and five-time MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa on Wednesday said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) should have taken a stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Dhindsa, MLA from Lehra constituency, said SAD was, today, nowhere close to alliance partner BJP as far as party principles weres concerned. “I praise the BJP for standing by its ideology. We may or may not agree with their ideology, but at least they take a stand and firm decisions for their ideology,” said Dhindsa, adding this was what strengthened the party’s base. He clarified that neither he nor his father, SAD Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, were thinking of joining the BJP. “We have forever been associated with the Akali Dal,” he said. Dhindsa had resigned as SAD legislature party head in state assembly on January 3 and SAD president Sukhbir Badal had accepted his resignation the same day. Dhindsa said his father had talked many times about the problems with SAD’s internal democracy, as decisions were taken at the top level and without taking other leaders of the party into confidence. “At times, they call meetings, but decisions are taken at the top and then the party has to follow,” he said. Raising questions on party leadership, Dhindsa said SAD was originally a panthic party, but was now being called anti-panthic by the Congress and other parties that had a history of atrocities against Sikhs. “The original culture of the SAD is no more the same,” he said, while reasoning it was a result of the party’s “certain wrong decisions” which could have been avoided. He said such a situation could have been retrieved by accepting some failures, like sacrilege cases that happened during the SAD regime, even though the party had no role in the crimes. On the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, Dhindsa said SAD had been talking about giving more rights to states. “Akali Dal should have taken a stand on Jammu and Kashmir. Whether Jammu and Kashmir would have or have not been converted into a Union territory was a separate issue,” he said, adding that all these things were against the basic Akali ideology. In CAA, only three countries – Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh - have been covered. “They could have included Myanmar and certain other communities. These countries are Muslim-dominated, but Sunni-majority countries. At times, Shias are also suppressed. Ahmadiyas have also been targeted,” said Dhindsa. He said if these countries and communities had also been included, it would have conveyed the message that India was there for everyone who had been suppressed or targeted.

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the first International Yoga Day Media Awards, Javadekar also said a misunderstanding over JNU was deliberately being spread in the varsity and others parts of the country to incite violence. Javadekar also claimed selective ""anarchists"" were raising slogans for a ""Free Kashmir"" even though ""the entire country"" supported revocation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir. He said Kashmir remains an inseparable part of India and claimed that peace ""has been prevailing"" in J&K and that the region is ""making progress since Article 370 of the Constitution was repealed"". ""The entire country is supporting the move... a few selective anarchists are raising such kind of slogans. Nobody even inside Kashmir raised such slogans.

 PM Modi changed political narrative: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: BJP chief Amit Shah on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi believed in delivering what was required for society without bothering about popularity ratings, adding that the Centre had taken several bold decisions which successive governments didn't dare to take for reasons like appeasement or vote bank politics. ""Modi has acted against three curses of Indian politics - appeasement, casteism and nepotism. This government works on efficiency and by keeping welfare of the people as the guiding principle, rather than vote bank politics. India has not seen a leader like Modi who takes strong decisions, in the interest of the nation and its people, without fearing backlash,"" Shah said. After releasing a book 'Karmayoddha Granth' on the life of Modi, Shah said the PM was the epitome of selfless service. He added that the government's decisions had shaped a strong image of India globally and Modi had revamped India's foreign policy and national security policy by de-linking the two. ""India emerged as a strong nation on the global stage while making its stance clear that India will not take attacks on itself lying down. India has emerged as a global power by taking bold decisions, including removal of Articles 370 and 35A in J&K, bringing Citizenship Amendment Act, resolution of Ram Mandir issue, criminalising triple talaq, conducting surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes, which nobody dared in the last 70 years,"" the BJP chief said. Shah said Modi had not only changed the political narrative by keeping the party manifesto at the centre of regovernance but had also taken tough decisions for people's welfare without caring about the consequences. ""The government is functioning on an ideology which keeps Deen Dayal Upadhyay's 'Antyodaya' at the centre,"" he added. Sharing his experience of working with Modi, Shah talked about the three phases of the PM's life, starting from dedicating his life to an ideology, entering politics on the ideals of the ""sangathan"", and finally upholding the tenets of parliamentary democracy and the Constitution to construct a welfare state. ""Modiji's childhood was devoid of luxury, full of poverty, disadvantages and neglect from society but he has dedicated his life towards the welfare of people, without having any ill-feeling for anyone in society,"" Shah said. He added that the Modi government had inherited a government plagued with corruption but had delivered a non-corruptible government since 2014, laying the foundation for a new India.

" Meanwhile, a bid to start ‘political process’ as ‘third front’ calls on LG | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: Eight former legislators of Jammu & Kashmir, led by Syed Altaf Bukhari, on Tuesday became the first group of mainstream politicians to open a channel of communication with the office of the Lieutenant Governor (LG) and make a slew of demands, including restoration of statehood and release of political prisoners. The delegation submitted a memorandum to LG Girish Chandra Murmu, also seeking protection of land and job rights of permanent residents. The former legislators urged the UT government to restore internet connectivity in all regions of J&K as a part of confidence-building measure and an outreach to the public. Later, a Raj Bhavan spokesman confirmed the group's visit, saying: ""A delegation of former legislators and politicians led by ex-minister Syed Altaf Bukhari met the lieutenant governor at the Raj Bhavan in Jammu on Tuesday. This is the beginning of the political process with mainstream parties."" Bukhari, a former PDP minister, who was later expelled from the party after the fall of the Mehbooba Mufti-led government in 2018, has reportedly collected the group of disgruntled former PDP MLAs and MLCs, besides his long-time friend Ghulam Hassan Mir, who is the president of the Democratic Party Nationalist, to form a third front in the absence of NC and PDP top leaders, who have been in jail since the revocation of special status of J&K. Parliament had on August 5 last year nullified Articles 370 and 35A, and ororganised the erstwhile state into two Union Territories - J&K and Ladakh. Besides Bukhari and Mir, the other members who formed the delegation are: Mohammad Dilawar Mir, Zaffar Iqbal, Javed Hassan Beig, Noor Mohammad Sheikh, Choudhary Qamar Hussain and Raja Manzoor Ahmad. ""We take this opportunity to solicit your attention towards the socio-political and economic situation that emerged since August 5, 2019. Since the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status embedded in Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and bifurcation of the State into two Union Territories - Jammu and Kashmir with a legislature and Ladakh without one - the majority of its residents are yet to reconcile with this decision,"" the memorandum said. The memorandum further said: ""Although it is heartening that Kashmir remained peaceful and no fatalities were recorded due to enhanced security measures and other administrative efforts, the credit must go to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who showed extreme maturity while registering their peaceful protest. ""Fact of the matter is that a majority of people in Jammu and Kashmir feel hurt and there are vocal concerns wherein they feel their decades-long privileges were unceremoniously curtailed."" The leaders further conveyed to the LG that, in order to win over the confidence of the people of Jammu and Kashmiri, the Centre should re-examine its decades-old policies vis-à-vis Kashmir. ""Depending solely on security measures and dealing with people's political aspirations through the law and order prism will always have its old, tested repercussions,"" the memorandum said. The memorandum also said that the nullification of Article 370 and, in particular, annulling of Article 35A on account of being ""discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir"" and it being ""an obstacle in the development of the state"" have outstanding issues. ""As we know, Article 35A, among its various provisions, granted special rights to permanent residents of J&K for, (i) employment under the State Government; (ii) acquisition of immovable property in the State; (iii) settlement in the State … and, of course, defining such residents,"" the memorandum said.

 Delegation of ambassadors to India to visit J&amp;K soon | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A delegation of ambassadors from 15-20 countries including those from the Gulf region is scheduled to visit Jammu and Kashmir soon to be briefed on the security situation in the union territory, officials said on Tuesday. They also said that efforts were on to rope in some ambassadors of the P5 countries like the US, the UK, France and Russia but confirmation is awaited. Around 15 to 20 envoys to India will be taken to the Kashmir valley later this week where they will be briefed by security agencies about the involvement of Pakistan in spreading militancy in the state, the officials said. On the same day, they will be taken to Jammu where they would meet Lt Governor G C Murmu and other officials before returning to the national capital the next day, they added. The sources said the envoys of a number of countries requested the government for a visit to Kashmir to get a first hand account of the situation prevailing in the valley following the abrogation of provisions of Article 370 there. The envoys to be taken to Kashmir are expected to represent various important regions, including Europe, Africa, Central Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. The move will be part of India's diplomatic outreach to rebut Pakistan's propaganda against it on the Kashmir issue. India had reached out to the P5 countries and all the world capitals, putting forward its perspective on its decision to abrogate Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two Union territories. After India announced its decision to reorganise J&K on August 5 last year, Pakistan reacted angrily to the move and mounted a major diplomatic offensive against New Delhi on the issue. Pakistan has also downgraded diplomatic ties by expelling the Indian envoy. This will the second visit of a foreign delegation to Kashmir since August 5, 2019, the day when the Centre withdrew special status of the state and also bifurcated it into two union territories -- Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir. Earlier, a delegation of 23 EU MPs was taken on a two-day visit to assess the situation in the union territory by International Institute for Nonaligned Studies, a Delhi-based think tank. However, the government had distanced itself from the visit of the delegation and minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy informed Parliament that the European parliamentarians were on a ""private visit"".

Bhopal united in protest against JNU violence | Bhopal News - Times of India,"BHOPAL: While addressing a gathering of protesters sitting on a ‘satyagraha’ against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register Citizens at Bhopal’s Iqbal Maidan on Monday, former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan said that what happened at the campus of Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) “never even happened during emergency” and that for the first time, students and teachers of universities were being “thrashed inside the campuses”. Gopinathan was referring to the Sunday evening attack by masked people on students and teachers on JNU campus . “They are scared of only one thing: questions. They feel that if anyone asks any questions, then he or she should be silenced,” said the ex-IAS officer who had resigned following the revocation of Article 370 in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. “If any student asks questions, then they are silenced by calling them ‘tukde tukde gang’. If any working-class person asks any questions, then they are silenced by being called ‘Urban Naxals’. If poor tribals ask questions, they are silenced by being labelled Maoists. If Muslims asks questions, they are silenced by being called terrorists”, he said. Speaking on CAA, NRC and NPR, Gopinathan said, “There are three things. Firstly, they are anti-constitution, then they are anti-poor and then they are anti-Muslims.” Urging the state government to refrain from conducting the NPR exercise, he said, “If the government have said that they are against CAA and NRC, then they should also not allow NPR.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

 Jammu and Kashmir finance department circular puts SSIs at peril | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: The J&K government’s September 17, 2019, order, directing all its departments to make purchases of goods like furniture etc. through the e-Governance Marketing (GeM) portal, has put at peril 2,000 small scale industries (SSIs) and jobs of 15,000 workers. Financial commissioner of the Union Territory of J&K A K Mehta had on September 17 last year issued a circular, directing all the government departments as well as autonomous bodies to acquire goods or items required in their offices through the GeM portal. To begin with, on November 22, the secretary of the department of rural development and panchayati raj released Rs 38.5 crore to two directors of rural development of Jammu and Kashmir regions for purchase of office furniture for block development councils and panchayats. The secretary explicitly mentioned in the order that the purchases should be made through the GeM portal as per the finance department circular. It was also mentioned in the order that the furniture items should be purchased from branded companies. The finance department order, which is seen to be biased against Jammu- and Kashmir-based industrial units, is the first of its kind since the nullification of Article 370 and revocation of special status of the erstwhile state on August 5 last year. SSI unit holders’ groups of both Jammu and Kashmir regions have expressed their fears about the future of the industrial sector in the newly created UT. “If the finance department continues to issue September 17-type orders, most of the small scale units in Jammu and Kashmir regions are likely to face closure in coming months,” said Lalit Mahajan, president of SSI unit holders’ association. Notably, the erstwhile state administration under President’s rule in 1995 had issued a circular on November 1 that year, instructing all government departments and autonomous bodies to make purchases from local SSI unit holders through Small Scale Industries Development Corporation, a government nodal agency, to ensure that the articles intended for supply are given at reasonable rates after proper tendering. The September 17 finance department order could result in the retrenchment of 15,000-odd workers, said Masood Ahmad, president of SSI unit holders in Srinagar. President of Jammu SSI unit holders’ association Lalit Mahajan said, “The MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) department under the Union industries ministry has made it mandatory for the state governments or UTs to make 20% purchases of the total order from local SSI unit holders under clause No.11 of public procurement policy Act of 2006.” The new dispensation of J&K under the lieutenant governor needed to devise a policy which would not let the industries in the UT die, Mahajan added. A senior official in the industries department said the government was chalking out a policy, which would accommodate the local industrial unit holders.

It also demanded lifting of curbs and restoration of internet services in the larger interest of trade, commerce, industry, academics and more importantly the educated unemployed who have to keep track on the avenues of jobs and career advancement. In a joint statement, marking five months of detention of the NC leaders and others since the abrogation of Article 370 provisions on August 5 last year, the party expressed concern over the continued detention of mainstream leaders, including three former chief ministers -- Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti --- in Kashmir and sought their release for restoration of ""genuine"" political activities in the Union territory. ""National Conference leaders felt the crucial need of restoring political activities in Jammu and Kashmir, stating that filling up of democratic space will remain a far cry as long mainstream leaders remain under detention,"" the party said in a statement here.

" Kashmir residents flock Banihal to use internet, convert prepaid SIM cards to postpaid | India News - Times of India","BANIHAL/ JAMMU: Banihal, along the Jammu-Srinagar national highway, is agog with activities over the past one month, thanks to the resumption of the train service in Kashmir and the normal functioning of the internet in the highway township. The resumption of the train service between Srinagar and Banihal on November 17 last year after remaining suspended for over three months following the nullification of Article 370 saw residents of Kashmir thronging the highway town, which falls in the Jammu region, to get access to the internet facility and convert prepaid mobile SIM cards to postpaid. The internet services continue to remain barred in the entire Valley except for some government offices, hospitals and business establishments since August 5 last year, the day the Centre announced abrogation of Article 370 provisions and bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. While the postpaid mobile phone service was restored in the Valley on October 14 last year after remaining suspended for 72 days, the prepaid mobile service is still blocked. Banihal, which houses the Jawahar Tunnel, known as the gateway to Kashmir - is just 110 kilometres from Srinagar and a two-hour journey by train. ""Over half a dozen internet cafes are functional in the town and many telecom service providers are having good business, mostly because of the heavy rush of students, employment seekers, businessmen and professionals from the Valley,"" Danish Muzaffar, a local, told PTI. He said since the train arrives from Kashmir at 10.30am and departs at 3.15pm daily, majority of the visitors return the same day but many prefer to stay overnight to complete their work, also boosting the business of hotels and restaurants. ""Due to the heavy rush of the customers at the internet cafes, we sometimes are unable to file our reports in time. The rush increased manifold after the resumption of the train service,"" Muzaffar said. Bilal Ahmad Bhat, who owns one of the internet cafes in the town, said the internet speed was a problem earlier but now it is normal and the users leave satisfied after finishing their work. On the complaints of overcharging, Bhat said, ""The customers are charged as per normal rates but since there are frequent power cuts, we have to use the generators and in such a case, the customers have to pay extra money."" The internet service in most parts of the Jammu region, where it was suspended, was restored by August end due to overall normal law and order situation. Hotelier Manzoor Ahmad said winter usually remains a lean period for their business but this time the occupancy is around 100 per cent. ""We are doing good, the guests are staying for a night or two,"" he said, adding the frequent closure of the Jammu-Srinagar national highway in view of landslides sometimes adds to the pressure. There is also a heavy rush of customers from the Valley to telecom service providers to convert their prepaid mobile SIM cards to postpaid. Shoukat Ahmad Wani, a contractor from Srinagar, said he visited the town on Friday and utilized the internet service to upload tenders besides converted the prepaid mobile SIM card to postpaid. ""The government has set up internet touch points at different places but these are inadequate to cater to the heavy rush,"" he said, requesting for restoration of the internet and prepaid mobile service in Kashmir. Farooq Ahmad Bhat, another Srinagar resident, accused the hoteliers of ""overcharging"". ""I used to pay Rs 700 to Rs 1,000 for a room depending on the facilities but this time they are charging between Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 for different categories of rooms,"" he said.

 2019 recorded highest ever ceasefire violations by Pak in J&amp;K in last 16 yrs | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Pakistani troops made the highest number of ceasefire violations in the last 16 years along the J&K border in 2019, amounting to over 3,200 instances or an average of nine such violations daily. Shelling and firing by Pakistani troops was ""very heavy"" in 2019, virtually making the 2003 India-Pakistan border truce ""redundant"", officials said. There have been 3,289 ceasefire violations by the Pakistan Army along the Indo-Pak border in 2019, they said. Of these, 1,565 ceasefire violations took place since August 2019, after the Indian government abrogated Article 370 and bifurcated the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. Revealing the data in reply to a RTI query of social activist Rohit Choudhary, Director, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Sulekha said October recorded the highest number of ceasefire violations at 398 followed by 333 in November, 323 in August, 314 in July, 308 in September and 275 in March. ""Pakistani troops repeatedly targeted forwards posts and villages along the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) to create a fear psychosis among the people,"" a senior police officer said. In 2018, Jammu and Kashmir had recorded 2,936 instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan with an average of eight cases daily, in which 61 people were killed and over 250 injured. The violations continued in 2019 despite Pakistani troops vowing to maintain peace on the border during flag meetings with the Indian forces, the Army official said. ""Pakistan vows to maintain peace and strengthen border relations, but they do not keep their promises,"" he said. The number of ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops in 2019 were over 300 more than in 2018 and over three times that of 2017, when 971 cases were reported. In 2017, 31 people — 12 civilians and 19 security forces personnel — were killed and 151 others suffered injures. The officials said due to frequent shelling and firing incidents, fear gripped the border populace and prompted thousands of people to migrate to safer places. People had to migrate to safer places on two occasions of shelling last year and three times the previous year, which affected their education and farm activities. To protect border residents in view of increasing ceasefire violations in Jammu and Kashmir, the central government sanctioned Rs 415 crore for the construction of over 14,400 underground bunkers along the LoC and the IB and made efforts to speed up the work last year. Over 8,600 bunkers have been constructed so far in Jammu region, they said. Giving details of cases of ceasefire violations in the past decade, the officials said 405 cases of ceasefire violations were reported in 2015, and 583 in 2014. There was a gradual increase in ceasefire violations by Pakistan between 2009 and 2013. The corresponding figures for 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 347, 114, 62, 44, and 28 respectively. The numbers of such violations were 77 in 2008, 21 in 2007 and three in 2006, according to official data. For three years - 2004, 2005 and 2006 - there was not a single such violation on the border. The Indian government led by late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee entered into a border ceasefire agreement with Pakistan along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir on November 26, 2003. India shares a 3,323-km-long border with Pakistan, of which 221 km of the International Border (IB) and 740 km of the Line of Control (LoC) fall in Jammu and Kashmir.

"At huge pro-CAA rally in Panaji, J P Nadda challenges Rahul Gandhi to speak on act | Goa News - Times of India","PANAJI: BJP national working president J P Nadda on Friday challenged former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to speak ten sentences on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and to make clear his opposition to it in two sentences. Nadda was addressing a 15,000-strong rally in support of CAA on Friday, which he flagged off from Patto in Panaji. The rally culminated at Azad Maidan in the capital with a public meeting. “Looking at the massive crowd it is clear to me that the Goans are aware about issues of national interest,” he said. Clarifying misunderstandings about the new constitutional law, Nadda said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah had made provisions to give citizenship to those from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who have fled to India due to religious persecution. The BJP working president said that Modi has taken decisions on issues that have been pending for the last 70 years, including the abrogation of Article 370. On Congress’ stand on the CAA, Nadda said it was petty thinking on their part. “Rahul Gandhi should speak ten lines on CAA and explain his opposition in two lines,” he said, adding that it was unfortunate that a party like the Indian National Congress, which has a long history, should today have a leader like Gandhi. The opposition is asking what will happen if religious minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh come to India, but the fact is that these people are already in our country, Nadda said. “Now we are giving them citizenship,” he said, adding that the relief was being provided through the act. About extending the same relief to Muslims from these countries, he said that being Muslims in Islamic countries how was it possible that they were among the persecuted. On Article 370, he said that Kashmiris are happy with Modi’s decision and that it was only a few leaders who were unhappy as they will no longer be able to reap benefits of Article 370, among which is the non-applicability of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Now, inquiries will be conducted against the leaders of Jammu and Kashmir for corruption, which could mean that many of them could land in jail, Nadda said. “Also now in Jammu and Kashmir, there will be reservations for tribals. They will be able to make it to even the parliament,” he said. Nadda also praised former chief minister Manohar Parrikar for taking various decision as defence minister.

The killing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force chief Qassim Suleimani, seen by many as the Gulf nation’s   second most powerful leader   after the Supreme Leader, by the US elicited a cautious response from India as it again called for restraint. “It’s vital that situation doesn’t escalate. India has consistently advocated restraint and continues to do so,’’ said the government. Increase in tension has alarmed the world: India on Iranian general's killingWhile the US remains India’s most important strategic partner,   India’s so-called civilisational ties   with Iran, its quest for an alternative route to central Asia and Afghanistan (bypassing Pakistan) and the fact that the region is home to almost 8 million Indians make it impossible for any Indian government to shun Tehran. As former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal says, India has been put in a very difficult position by this “irresponsible act’’ by President Donald Trump, one which cannot be justified by any international law. “This will provoke retaliation and ultimately end up destabilising the region and jeopardising our wide-ranging interests there,’’ says Sibal. 'A more dangerous world': Iran general's killing triggers global alarmWhile India has drastically cut down its crude imports from Iran under US pressure, neighbouring Iraq has emerged as one of its top energy suppliers and any military escalation in the region, as Sibal says, could hurt India’s supplies. Former diplomat and a leading voice on Middle-East affairs, Talmeez Ahmed, says India’s reaction is in keeping with its traditional bilateral and transactional approach, one which he adds has already run its course. “My own view is that India should no longer sit on the fence and instead use its clout to play a more robust diplomatic role in promoting peace and security in the region. What’s the use of pursuing the old approach if the situation continues to deteriorate,’’ says Ahmed, adding that any military conflagration in the region could hurt thousands of Indians within days. Iran supreme leader vows 'severe revenge' for Soleimani killingSibal, in fact, believes there’s another significant issue at play here; that of the US showing scant regard for the interests of its partners. He says Trump’s air strike is purely in domestic political context with no consideration for its likely impact on important partners like India. “The US should now do some serious introspection before lecturing India and recommending action on issues like Article 370 and CAA,’’ he says.

Punjab BJP minority cell general secretary: Citizenship (Amendment) Act anti-Constitution | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"JALANDHAR: Punjab BJP minority cell general secretary Shaina Parveen on Friday opposed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), saying that the new law was “anti-Constitution” and should be withdrawn. She also said that her greatest worry was that the law could harm the interest of the party. “I supported the law banning ‘triple talaq’ and also partial abrogation of Article 370 as these were in national interest, but this law (CAA) is against the spirit of the constitution,” said Parveen, who is also member of national executive of the minority morcha cell, while speaking to TOI on Friday. “None can question my loyalty to my country and to my party, but I think this law is anti-constitution. I have even faced adversities from members of my community as I worked for the party during elections and made members of my community to vote for BJP. However, I remained steadfast in my loyalty to the party. I have given everything to the party. But now I am getting negative feedback from members of the my community and they are worried. Even members of other communities are worried and country appears to be staring at a trouble,” she said. “Anybody who faces prospects of losing his home would be worried,” she argued. Despite the Prime Minister and the Union home minister already having clarified that Muslims of the country need not worry, the people were worried, she added.

" Surgical strikes sent Pakistan a message, says Army chief | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: There are enough viable and effective options to teach punitive lessons to Pakistan for aiding and abetting cross-border terrorism without crossing its nuclear red-lines, like it was done during the ""surgical strikes"" of September 2016 and the Balakot air strikes in February last year, Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Friday. The new Army chief told TOI that the strikes sent an unequivocal message to Pakistan, which may have re-activated the JeM terror facility at Balakot, that India ""can take down"" terror camps, infrastructure and launch pads across the border. ""The strikes definitely achieved a lot. It was a big message to Pakistan that it cannot operate with impunity,"" said General Naravane, adding Islamabad would be ""cautious before it thinks of doing anything escalatory"" in future. Pakistan, of course, often indulges in nuclear sabre-rattling, brandishing its 70-km range Nasr (Hatf-IX) nuclear missiles as an effective battlefield counter to India's ""Cold Start"" conventional war strategy. Pakistan PM Imran Khan, after the Modi government abrogated J&K's special status in August, even warned of a nuclear conflagration that would spill beyond the subcontinent if the international community did not pressure India on Kashmir. Brushing all this aside, General Naravane said, ""Historically, nuclear weapons have been a good deterrence, and that is where their role ends…We have carried out (cross-border) operations on two-three occasions without nuclear (weapons) coming into play."" Though General Naravane asserted violence levels have significantly reduced in J&K after the reading down of Article 370, and the law and order situation was ""set to further improve"", the Army's latest assessment is that there are 250-270 terrorists ""concentrated"" across the Line of Control (LoC) in areas south of the Pir Panjal mountain range, with another 160-190 to the north of it. ""There are many terrorists waiting across ready to infiltrate … they keep trying every day and we keep foiling them. There are certain foreign terrorists, even non-Pakistani ones, among them. We are keeping a close watch on the terror camp and launch pads across the LoC, though many are makeshift and keep changing their locations,"" said the Army chief. The defence establishment is much more positive about the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, especially after the first informal summit between PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jingping at Wuhan in April 2018 led to ""strategic guidance"" to the two militaries to manage and defuse troop face-offs during patrolling in accordance with existing protocols and mechanisms. But India must be ""firm in its resolve and be assertive about its claims, without being aggressive"", while working towards solving the vexed boundary issue with China. ""For several years now, we have been focusing on improving our infrastructure and capabilities along the `northern borders' with China. We must be prepared for all eventualities. If you want peace, you must be prepared (for war),"" said General Naravane. It's virtually ""impossible for the Army to guard every inch"" of the borders with China, which are longer with ""more inhospitable terrain"" than the borders with Pakistan. So, the aim is to ""be strong in important areas"" along the LAC, while mounting ""strong surveillance backed with quick-reaction capabilities"" in other parts. ""A strong infrastructure, surveillance and resolve is needed to guard the northern borders,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Protests in Kargil, Budgam, Srinagar against US killing of top Iran commander | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI/ SRINAGAR: Shias in Kargil, who have supported the Indian Army over the years in the area where members of its community are deployed as porters, held protests on Friday against the killing of Qassim Suleimani, head of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, in a US drone strike. Elsewhere in Kashmir, mild protest demonstrations were held in several areas of Shia-dominated Budgam after Friday prayers while Shias in local mosques in several Srinagar localities, like Abi Guzar, Shaheed Gunj and Zadibal, offered prayers for the slain Iranian commander. The administration of the newly formed UT of Ladakh had last Friday lifted the mobile internet ban in Kargil where no untoward incident had been reported since August 5 following the nullification of Article 370. Friday’s protest was held by the Anjuman Jamiyat Ulama Isna Ashriya Kargil Ladakh (AJUIAK), led by Imam Jumma Sheikh. Protesters raised slogans against the US and Israeli governments while hailing the supremacy of the Shia leader of Iran, Grand Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei. The Shia demonstrators in Kargil said Suleimani had “contributed to wiping out the deadly ISIS from Syria and Iraq who were perpetrators of violence in various parts of the world”. “We are part of Hindustan, as such, we are obliged to bring prosperity and peace to our region. We have to respect our faith and support Iran at this time. Till today we don’t have a central university of Islamic studies in Kargil while we make up 90% of this town. We did not let this town erupt in any violence during reorganisation or otherwise. Today it was a symbolic peaceful protest,” said AJUIAK general secretary Sheikh Ibrahim Khalili. Over the years, several students from Kargil have visited Iran on pilgrimage to Mashad, and Iraq on pilgrimages to Karbala and Najaf. The Kargil protesters said they would continue to support the Indian government and agencies in weeding out terror. In Budgam town, shops were shut for several hours as a mark of the protest while dozens of people holding banners against the US and in support of Iran took out processions and later dispersed peacefully. Shops in the area resumed business after Friday prayers. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Surgical strike failed to demoralise Pak terrorists: Shiv Sena | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Friday targeted the Centre by questioning the ""efficacy"" of the 2016 surgical strike and said the perception that it would demoralise Pakistani terrorists remained an ""illusion"" as Indian soldiers continue to get killed in terror attacks in Kashmir. Accusing the Modi government of boasting about how Pakistan was straightened out after the surgical strike, the Sena sought to know whether it has really happened. It also observed that troubled borders were not good for the country's well-being. The Sena's remarks come in the wake of the death of an Army soldier from Maharashtra, Naik Sandip Raghunath Sawant, who was killed during a counter-insurgency operation in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday. ""The New Year did not begin on a positive note in Kashmir. Our jawan from Satara, Sandip Sawant, attained martyrdom in Kashmir along with two other soldiers. In the last one month, seven to eight jawans from Maharashtra were killed in the line of duty. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra is not responsible for this,"" the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'. The party also questioned whether the situation in Kashmir has improved after the surgical strike and abrogation of Article 370 provisions. The party, however, maintained that scrapping Article 370 was a good move. India had conducted the surgical strike on September 29, 2016, across the Line of Control (LoC) as a response to a terrorist attack on an Indian Army base in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir earlier that month. Without naming the Centre, the Sena alleged, ""Circulating news that only the Pakistanis were getting killed in Kashmir will not change the reality as tricolour-draped bodies of Indian soldiers, like Sawant, are reaching their respective villages."" ""There is a bloodshed along the Kashmir border and mounting anger among the families of martyred jawans. The perception that surgical strike will demoralise Pakistani terrorists has turned out to be an illusion. In fact, the (terror) attacks have increased,"" it added. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party accused the ruling BJP of boasting about straightening out Pakistan after the surgical strike. ""But has Pakistan been really straightened out? Rather Pakistan has been indulging in ceasefire violations along the LoC every day,"" it added. The Shiv Sena also questioned the government's claim that the situation in Kashmir was under control after the nullification of Article 370. ""It is good that Article 370 was scrapped. Before that, surgical strike was carried out in Pakistan. But has the situation in Kashmir improved? The terror attacks continue. It's only that there is a control in reporting (these incidents),"" it said. The Sena also alleged that there was no clarity as to what was transpiring in Kashmir after the scrapping of Article 370 and only the media reports of soldiers sacrificing their lives have been coming out from that state In a veiled attack on the BJP, its erstwhile ally, the Sena, also accused it of exploiting the surgical strike for political gains.

""A joint trade delegation, comprising 22 trade and business organisations from the Kashmir valley and led by the KCCI, called on the Lt governor at Jammu,"" KCCI president Shiekh Ashiq told PTI. He said the delegation apprised Murmu about the business losses incurred in the valley since the Centre's decision of abrogation of Article 370 provisions on August 5. ""We submitted a detailed report about the losses and made certain demands. The Lt governor gave a patient hearing to our demands and assured us the government will look into them,"" Ashiq said.

Pakistan trying to arrange OIC session in Islamabad: Foreign office - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan was trying to arrange the next regular session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Islamabad, foreign office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said on Thursday. Farooqui made the comments at the weekly press briefing where she was asked about the possibility of a special session of the OIC on Kashmir. ""The work is under way ... Pakistan desires the next regular session of the OIC in Islamabad,"" she responded. Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi last week said that Pakistan wanted an early meeting of the OIC foreign ministers on Kashmir. Qureshi's statement came after the media reports here said that Saudi Arabia conveyed to Pakistan through its foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan that it was planning to convene a meeting on the Kashmir issue. State-run Radio Pakistan even reported that the ministerial level OIC meeting was expected to be held in Islamabad in April. The OIC is a 57-member grouping of Muslim majority nations, including Pakistan. The OIC has usually been supportive of Pakistan and often sided with Islamabad on the Kashmir issue. Farooqui also called for immediate lifting of the curfew, restoration of internet, release of political prisoners and permission to international observers to witness the situation on ground in Kashmir. She said Pakistan was facing challenges along the Line of Control (LoC) due to India's frequent ""unprovoked ceasefire violations and heavy deployment of weapons."" Pakistan has shared its concerns about LoC violations with the UN and other international partners, she said, adding that the foreign minister recently wrote the seventh letter to the UNSC president about the situation. Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5 and bifurcating it into two Union territories. Reacting sharply to India's decision, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled India's high commissioner. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.

Iltija, a Special Security Group protectee, said she had sought permission to visit her grandfather's grave in the Bijbehara area of Anantnag district. ""I have been detained at home and not allowed to move anywhere,"" Iltija told PTI.

" To soothe nerves, govt may reserve jobs for J&amp;K locals | India News - Times of India","JAMMU: Following opposition from all mainstream political parties to removal of the domicile provision for government jobs in J&K and reports that the Centre has agreed to restore the provision, the J&K high court on Tuesday evening withdrew its notification, inviting applications for 33 non-gazetted posts from aspirants across the country. The move had sparked fear that the J&K administration was taking away government job reservation for “permanent residents” in the aftermath of nullification of Articles 370 and 35A on August 5 last year. According to official sources, the central government is likely to issue a notification in the next three-four days to include domicile provision and job reservation in the executive order to be issued by the ministry of home affairs in relation to J&K. The sources said the notification is likely to have the clause that any Indian citizen can acquire residency of J&K only after staying in the UT uninterruptedly for a period of 15 years. However, exemption may be offered to IAS and IPS officers, and their families, who have worked in J&K, besides armed forces personnel from any part of the country, the sources disclosed. During the passage of J&K reorganization bill on August 5 last year, Parliament had retained as many as 166 local laws, a senior official in the UT law department said. The reorganization of the erstwhile state has granted citizenship to 1.3 lakh west-Pakistani refugees settled in Jammu, Gokhras and Valmikis, who have stayed put in J&K since 1947. The central government has already retained the local Public Service Commission, Board of Professional Entrance Examination (BOPEE) and other recruitment boards in the UT in order to make recruitments to various departments exclusively for “permanent residents” of J&K. Withdrawing the recruitment notification, the J&K high court registrar general said on the HC website: “It is hereby notified for information of all the concerned that the advertisement Notice No. 09/2019 dated 26.12.2019, whereby applications were invited for different posts in Non-Gazetted category in the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir, stands withdrawn with immediate effect under No.977/NG on December 31, 2019.” In the now-withdrawn notification, nearly 17 of the 33 posts were kept under “OM (open merit)” category, throwing them open for appointment of aspirants from across the country. The rest were reserved for local SC, ST and other such categories. Meanwhile, local BJP leaders have stepped up their demand for retention of domicile and job reservation provisions to protect the interests of the UT’s unemployed youths. Earlier, J&K BJP president Ravindra Raina had told TOI that the local leadership would take up the issue with the BJP high command because throwing open of J&K government jobs to “outsiders” would alienate the local unemployed youths further.

 SMS of BSNL users partially restored in Valley | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: J&K authorities on Wednesday partially restored SMS in Kashmir Valley only for state-run BSNL users while leaving subscribers of private telcos in the lurch. Broadband internet facilities to hospitals and schools, however, were not made available as announced by the government on Tuesday.

Non-BSNL users said that their SMS still remained suspended in the Valley. “We are trying to send messages to our friends and relatives to greet them on New Year, but our attempts are failing as SMS still remains suspended,” said a Vodafone user. “We are not even getting OTP messages from banks to know about the details of our respective accounts,” said Ghulam Hassan Dar, a businessman.

 J&amp;K high court withdraws notification for filling up district court vacancies on pan-India basis | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir high court has withdrawn its advertisement notification to fill up 33 non-gazetted posts in district courts of the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh, a move which triggered an opposition outcry against the opening of employment to all Indians after the nullification of Article 370 in August last year. The advertisement to fill the vacancies was issued by the J&K High Court's Registrar General Sanjay Dhar on December 26, 2019 with the last date for submission of applications being January 31, 2020.

" After Ayodhya &amp; Rafale verdicts in 2019, SC to decide on CAA &amp; J&amp;K this year | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: At a time when dissent gets traction among intellectuals and social media, the Supreme Court in 2019 achieved the unexpected by rendering a unanimous verdict on the 70-year-old Ayodhya land dispute and putting stamp of approval on the deal to purchase 36 fully-loaded Rafale jets from France. In achieving unanimity in the contentious Ayodhya land dispute, which was argued belligerently for 40 days, the credit must go to each of the five judges, who hailed from different backgrounds and regions, and to the leadership of then CJI Ranjan Gogoi as those in forefront of the legal battle had predicted a split verdict. The decision was unique as it did not have the name of the author, a gesture by the leader of the bench to acknowledge the contribution of each judge - Justices S A Bobde (now CJI), D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer. Controversy over purchase of Rafale jets from France, involvement of Anil Ambani’s firm as Indian offshore partner of French manufacturer Dassault, coupled with incessant reports on select documents by a section of the media forced the SC to revisit its December 2018 verdict giving a clean chit to the NDA government. Petitioners - Prashant Bhushan, Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha - tried their best to fly Rafale into Bofors infamy. After a detailed examination, the court came up with the same finding - nothing wrong with the deal. Only one to face awkward situation was former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who apologised to SC for having misquoted the court order in public. He was advised to be careful in future. The SC also revisited its decision quashing the custom that barred entry of women in 10-50 years’ age group into Sabarimala Ayyappa temple in Kerala. If the earlier decision was 4-1, the five-judge bench by 3-2 majority decided to send the contentious issue to a seven-judge bench. The majority judgement said the 7-judge bench must chart out a guideline for the court to decide in future on issues where fundamental rights clashed with faith and custom. The larger bench in the new year could also look into discriminatory practices in other religions - entry of women into mosques, entry of Parsi women who are married outside the community into Agiyari and the practice of female genital mutilation in Bohra Muslim community. Though it gave judgements on three contentious issues - Ayodhya, Rafale and Sabarimala, the SC would get no respite in 2020, with the first task in hand being adjudication on the constitutional validity of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which saw nation-wide protests. Another Constitution bench headed by Justice N V Ramana will also decide on the constitutional validity of the Centre’s decision to end the 70-year-long special status conferred on Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution and divide the state into two Union Territories. Justice Ramana-headed bench will also deliver judgement on validity of restrictions imposed on use of mobile phones and internet after the August 5 decision. The SC also redeemed people’s faith in it by upholding disqualification of 15 Congress-JD(S) MLAs in Karnataka, who played a key role in toppling the coalition government led by H D Kumaraswamy. However, the bench headed by Justice Ramana expressed anguish over Speakers increasingly forgetting their impartial role and dancing to the tune of the party in office. If prolonged mobile phone shutdown post-August 5 caused hardship to residents of the Kashmir valley, the SC decision allowing government to recover Rs 92,000 crore from telecom service providers pushed the operators to a corner and the sector into a tailspin. It also judicially examined the CBI vs CBI fight erupting from personal differences between then director Alok Verma and the special director Rakesh Asthana and the powers of the Centre to divest the CBI chief of his powers and send the two top agency officials on leave. Though SC reinstated Verma, he was quickly replaced by a PM-led high-level panel. After lulling the shadow boxing between Verma and Asthana, the SC penalised the West Bengal police for seeing a ghost in the movie ‘Bhobhisyoter Bhoot’ and unofficially pressuring theatre owners not to screen the film. It also granted bail to P Chidamabram, refusing to go by the contents of the sealed cover docket provided by ED about corruption by the former finance minister in the INX media foreign investment case.

Rohit Kansal, principal secretary to the J&K government and official spokesman, said SMS will start functioning again in Kashmir from 12 midnight, at a press conference in Srinagar on Tuesday. “J&K government has decided to restore SMS in Kashmir from midnight today. There is no official decision as to when the internet services would be restored. The issue is under active consideration of the government,” Kansal said. He said internet services would be restored as soon as the situation becomes conducive in Kashmir.

On Tuesday, the Valley-based journalists held a protest inside the Kashmir press club demanding the restoration of broadband internet services at their respective offices to facilitate their work.

Manoj Mukund Naravane:   India reserves right to strike at terror sources: New Army chief | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan that India reserves the right to pre-emptively strike at cross-border sources of terror if it does not stop state-sponsored terrorism, the country’s new military brass on Tuesday said the armed forces are in a high state of operational readiness and better prepared to tackle the challenges on the western and eastern fronts now. “Yes, we are better prepared,” said the country’s first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat. New Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, in turn, said his force is “fully prepared to meet any eventuality” along the volatile Line of Control with Pakistan, which has witnessed as many as 3,200 ceasefire violations this year to beat all annual records since 2003. A graded strategy of “resolute punitive responses” is in place to punish cross-border terrorism, said Gen Naravane, who took over as the 28th Army chief from Gen Rawat on Tuesday. “We are aware there are terrorists on the other side in various launchpads waiting to cross over but we are fully prepared to meet this threat. We have strong counter-infiltration and counter-terrorism grids, which we keep modifying as per the inputs that we receive,” he said, talking to news agencies. “Our neighbour uses terrorism as tool of state policy, as a way of carrying out proxy war against us, while maintaining deniability. However, this state can’t last long. As they say, you can't fool all the people, all the time,” he added. The Army chief also said the Pakistan Army-ISI combine’s relentless efforts to deflect attention from its state-sponsored terrorism had “totally failed”. There has been “a definite improvement” in the internal security situation in J&K after the abrogation of Article 370, with the “proxy war” being waged from across the border suffering a major setback due to elimination of terrorists and terror networks. “The incidents of violence in J&K have seen a marked decline, this augurs very well for population of J&K. It’s a step forward towards bringing peace and prosperity to the region,” he said. The military brass said border tensions with China along the Line of Actual Control had decreased substantially, with the two armies now actively working to reduce and manage troop confrontations after receiving “strategic guidance” from their leaders following the Wuhan summit in April 2018. While India will continue to build its capabilities and infrastructure along the “northern borders” with China, the post-Wuhan guidelines had been disseminated right down the chain of command to the battalion-level to maintain peace and tranquility on the LAC, said Gen Naravane.

 Big rush for UGC-NET in Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Despite an internet clampdown, Jammu and Kashmir registered 83.5% attendance of candidates registered in the UGC-NET December 2019 exam, second only to 84% in Kerala, and also recorded a 10% qualification rate as against the national average of 8.2%. The UGC-NET test was the first exam held post abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370 and its redesignation as a Union Territory. The test saw a significant jump in attendance as against the June 2019 or December 2018 tests held in the UT. In a first, the eligibility test was also held in Leh and Ladakh region. Another first is that the national testing authority (NTA) will issue certificates of assistant professorship and fellowship letters within four days of the results, which usually takes four months to be issued. The results declared on Tuesday saw a record number of over 79,000 candidates qualifying. The National Eligibility Test (NET), also known as UGC-NET, determines eligibility for the post of assistant professor and junior research fellowship (JRF) award in Indian universities and colleges. Among the five states which recorded 80% plus attendance, J&K is second only to Kerala (84.08). In June 2019 test, J&K registered 77.12% attendance. Interestingly, Baramulla district, which has often witnessed terror attacks, registered highest attendance of 94%. In all, a total of 31,147 aspirants appeared for the test in J&K of which 3,243 qualified which is 10.4% and second only to Uttar Pradesh where 13% aspirants qualified. “This shows the aspiration of youth of Jammu and Kashmir and the government has created an environment where they can come out in large numbers. Our focus will continue to improve so that we can offer more opportunities to youth of J&K. I commend their motivation levels and wish them well and urge them to be torch bearers of progress,” said Ramesh Pokhriyal, union minister for human resource development. In general, the total number of candidates increased by over a lakh, up from 6,81,718 in June 2019 and December 2018. Of 65,239 successful candidates, 31,095 are women. The three states which have more than 10,000 qualifications are Uttar Pradesh (20,877), Rajasthan (14,554) and Delhi (12,364). There are total of 17 transgender candidates who took the test and one qualified. Quick issuance of eligibility certificates will cheer candidates. “This used to take around three to four months. From this year, the certificates will be issued immediately without any delay to help the candidates. NTA will issue the certificates this year,” said a senior HRD official.

 J&amp;K BJP opposes throwing open of jobs to ‘outsiders’ | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Jammu & Kashmir BJP and other mainstream political parties on Tuesday opposed the move to throw open jobs in the newly formed Union Territory to aspirants from across the country. TOI had on Monday reported that the J&K high court has issued a recruitment notice, inviting applications for 33 non-gazetted posts from candidates across India following the nullification of Articles 370 and 35A. The recruitment notice was put up on the internet on December 26. This is the first time in the Valley that eligibility for any government job isn’t limited to “permanent residents” of Kashmir and Ladakh. Of the 33 advertised posts, as many as 17 are in the “OM (open merit)” category, which means anyone from outside J&K can be selected for those. “We will plead before the BJP high command in New Delhi and demand for J&K residents several guarantees that are in vogue in several other states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, besides other northeastern states,” J&K BJP president Ravindra Raina told TOI. He added, “We have already forcefully put forward our demands about job reservation for the hundreds of thousands of our unemployed youths here. Who will so politely and meekly give up their right to government jobs in their own place of birth?” Raina said the central leadership of the party was seriously thinking over the issue and it would be resolved soon. “Once the issue is sorted out, it would enable us to fill some 50,000 vacancies at various levels in J&K,” he said. “Provisions like job reservation and domicile can be done with an administrative order by the Lt Governor here,” Raina suggested. J&K Congress president G A Mir went a step ahead and demanded the restoration of pre-August 5, 2019 (when Article 370 was defanged) position to the erstwhile state. “BJP stands exposed after J&K high court invited applications for 33 posts from candidates across the country. The Narendra Modi government has been screaming day in and day out that job rights of J&K residents would be protected, but the reality is the way that our high court has adopted,” Mir said. Similarly, the Jammu-based leadership of National Conference (NC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) is also annoyed with the high court move. “Educated unemployed Jammu youths are wary of their future in the given situation. There is a dire need for job reservation in J&K. In the absence of such a guarantee, Kashmiri youths would get more alienated now,” NC provincial president Davinder Singh Rana said. PPD leader Ved Mahajan and Harsh Dev Singh of Panthers Party equally expressed their worries about future of the youths of the UT. Both the leaders said it was worrisome for the unemployed youths that they lost job opportunities as well with revocation of the special status of J&K. Even common Jammu residents are voicing their concern over throwing open of government jobs to “outsiders” when there was an alarming unemployment problem in J&K. Sanjay Kumar, a graduate from Kunjwani in Jammu, said: “I had been endlessly waiting for some employment notice for a long time now. But the J&K high court one stunned and disappointed me as it threw open 33 posts to candidates from across the country.” The murmurs of protest are likely to grow louder across the UT in coming months over job reservation and domicile guarantees enjoyed by permanent residents under Articles 370 and 35A.

Manoj Mukund Naravane:   India reserves right to preemptively strike at sources of terror: Army chief | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In a stern warning to Pakistan, new Army Chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday said India reserves the right to preemptively strike at sources of terror if the neighbouring country does not stop state-sponsored terrorism. In an exclusive interview to PTI hours after taking charge of the 1.3-million strong force, Gen Naravane also said the Army will enhance combat capabilities along the border with China so that it is fully prepared to deal with any challenge. ""The threat remains from both northern and western sides. Over the last many years, we have been concentrating on our western borders while our northern border was at a little lower in priority. There was a need to rebalance and reprioritise,"" he said. Giving an overall perspective of India's security challenges, he said the focus is being shifted from the western border to the northern border as part of ""re-balancing of priorities"". On combating cross-border terrorism, Gen Naravane said a strategy of ""resolute punitive response"" was put in place to deal with Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and asserted that the situation in Kashmir improved significantly after abrogation of Article 370. ""If Pakistan does not stop its policy of state sponsored terrorism, we reserve the right to preemptively strike at the sources of terror threat and this intent has adequately been demonstrated in our response during surgical strikes and Balakot operation,"" the Army Chief said. He said an approach of zero tolerance to terror has already been showcased and a ""new normal"" in India's response mechanism has emphatically been underlined. ""The situation in the Valley has improved significantly after abrogation of Article 370. Incidents of violence are coming down. The terrorists-initiated actions have come down. There is no doubt that there is a lot of improvement,"" the 28th Chief of Army Staff said. ""However the problem remains. It has not gone away. So we will always be ready whatever measures are required to deal with the challenges,"" he said. Gen Naravane said the Pakistan Army's ""all out efforts"" to deflect attention from state-sponsored terrorism has been a total failure and that its proxy war design received a setback due to elimination of terrorists and decimation of terror networks by Indian forces. Asked how he will deal with Pakistan-backed terrorism, he said, ""Multiple options across the spectrum of conflict are on the table to respond to any act of terror sponsored or abetted by Pakistan."" Gen Naravane said Pakistan tried to draw global attention following India's decision to reorganise Jammu and Kashmir, but its efforts did not get any traction. Referring to the rising number of ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC), he said it is being done to keep alive the Kashmir issue. On security challenges along the 3,500-km border with China, Gen Naravane said: ""We will continue to improve capability building along the northern border so we are prepared when the need arises."" ""After the Wuhan summit, both nations have issued strategic guidance to their respective forces with an aim to maintain peace and tranquillity along the borders, locally resolve differences and not allow them to turn into disputes,"" he said. ""The guidance has manifested on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and conduct of troops from both sides has been cordial despite some prevailing differences, differing perceptions of the LAC and some friction in sensitive areas,"" he said. Referring to the appointment of a Chief of Defence Staff, he said it will greatly change the way the defence establishment operates and will bring about significant reforms in the entire military system. His main focus as Army chief will be to make the force ready to face any threat at any time, the general said. According to him, the bottomline for reforms in the Army will be to increase efficiency and operational readiness. ""Modernisation is a continuous process. Whatever we are doing, the start point is to increase efficiency and operational readiness,"" he said.

 2019: A watershed year for BJP but new challenges emerge | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The year 2019 will go down as a watershed in the BJP's journey as the party not only achieved its highest ever tally in Lok Sabha but also realised its decades-long ideological planks with the Modi government pushing the saffron agenda with renewed vigour in its second term. However, it was not altogether a smooth run for the BJP as regional satraps in alliance with the Congress succeeded in dethroning it in Maharashtra and Jharkhand while nationwide protests against the citizenship law and the concept of National Register for Citizens pushed it on the defensive. The scale of protests prompted its top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah, to decouple the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) with the NRC, and it remains uncertain as to how the saffron party will push on with its ideological agenda in the face of mounting challenges. All debated and done, party leaders are likely to look back at 2019 with more than a touch of satisfaction as the year saw nullification of Article 370, criminalisation of triple talaq, enactment of CAA and a Supreme Court order paving the way for Ram temple construction in Ayodhya, issues which have agitated Hindutva cadres for decades. If the results of the April-May general election underscored the BJP's preeminence in national politics with the party winning 303 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha, its footprint in state governments was reduced to a mere 35 per cent of the country's landmass from the peak of 71 per cent in 2017. If the outgoing year again highlighted the appeal of 'brand Modi', it also brought to light the BJP's vulnerability in state elections when the prime minister and national issues are not driving factors for the common voter's choice. The massive mandate of 303 seats in the general elections, however, set off its own unintended consequences for the party, which managed to ruffle feathers of quite a few allies with its ""big brotherly"" airs. The BJP lost its Hindutva ally Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the JD(U), which is now its biggest partner, is yet to get over the slight of being offered merely one cabinet berth in the Modi government as a ""symbolic representation"", as Bihar party leaders recalled disdainfully. JD(U) president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar summarily rejected the proposal. The year also saw the rise and rise of Shah as he after being inducted as the home minister in the second Modi government was the face of the central dispensation in pushing its major decisions with distinct ideological hues. Whether it was the nullification of Article 370, bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, strengthening of anti-terror laws or the passage of the amended citizenship bill, Shah spearheaded the government's agenda and took on the opposition with his usual mix of combative articulation and ideological clarity. Even when he focussed his energies on leading the party during the first term of the Modi government, there was never a doubt on who is the real number two in the organisation after Modi. And it was no coincidence that Shah was at the helm of the government's drive to carry out the BJP's central Hindutva planks in the second stint of the government. A Supreme Court in the favour of building a Ram temple in Ayodhya has came as a boost to the party. The BJP organisation is expected to undergo a shake-up in the new year as Shah is likely to make way for its working president J P Nadda at the top. When the ongoing organisational elections end, expected in January, the party may have some new faces in its structure but is unlikely to change its course much from the path laid down by Shah in more than five and an half years of his term. In terms of the upcoming electoral challenges, the new year is likely to pose some tough question to the saffron war machine as it prepares for the assembly polls in Delhi and Bihar. Arvind Kejriwal-led Aap Aadmi Party had defied the pro-BJP sentiments in the 2015 polls and handed the main rival its worst drubbing in the national capital by winning 67 seats in the 70-member assembly and reducing it to three. BJP leadership has been working overtime to come back to power in the city which handed it all seven Lok Sabha seats in the general election, as was the case in the 2014 polls too, but is hamstrung by the lack of a face to take on Kejriwal, who is backing on his populist schemes to retain power. The Election Commission is likely to announce the dates for Delhi polls soon. In Bihar, many observers believe the BJP in the alliance with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) and Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP is better placed against the rival RJD-Congress combine after winning all but one of its 40 Lok Sabha seats. However, there is also a view that the chemistry between Kumar and the BJP is far from perfect and differences may crop up between them over sharing of seats in the assembly elections. JD(U) leaders have indicated that they want their party to fight on more seats than the BJP in the politically crucial state. Amid rancour in their ties after some BJP leaders sniped at Kumar, Shah had walked the extra mile earlier to bring the alliance back on track by asserting that the JD(U) president will again lead the NDA in the state assembly polls, which are due later this year.

Modi Government in 2019: Key decisions taken by the Narendra Modi government in 2019 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In 2019, the BJP-led NDA government came to power with a resounding victory. In the runup to the Lok Sabha elections and following its decisive mandate, the Narendra Modi government has taken several deicsion which hogged the national news headlines this year. Here is a look at some of these decisions taken by the government — 1. Balakot airstrikesOn February 26, a vehicle-borne suicide bomber carried out a ghastly attack on a CRPF convoy on its way from Jammu to Srinagar leading to the death of 40 paramilitary personnel. The attack, the deadliest on Indian security forces since 1989, was carried out by Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. A week later, on February 26, India retaliated by launching pre-dawn airstrikes destroying terror camps in Balakot, Pakistan, killing a large number of terrorists. Within hours, the Pakistan Air Force responded and in the ensuing dogfight, IAF lost a MiG-21 fighter leading to the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman by the Pakistan forces. After 60 hours in captivity, Varthaman was released by Pakistan. The tensions between the two countries prevailed for several months. 2. Reservation for economically weaker sectionsAhead of 17th Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought the 124th Constitution Amendment Bill, 2019, which provided 10 per cent reservation to people from economically weaker sections (EWS) in government jobs and educational institutes. The amendment allowed those in the general category with an annual income of up to Rs 8 lakh to seek a reservation in government jobs and education. 3. Instant Triple Talaq becomes a criminal offenceThe Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 was given the presidential assent in July 2019 amidst objections from the Muslim community. In December 2017, the Supreme Court had declared instant triple talaq unconstitutional. Drawing upon Supreme Court's verdict, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill was tabled in the parliament in 2017 but it failed to pass in both the houses. However, in July 2019, the Bill was passed in both the houses and the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, made instant triple talaq by Muslim men a criminal offence punishable by a jail term of up to three years. 4. Jammu & Kashmir loses special statusThe Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government in August announced the scrapping of Article 370 which gave special status to the state. In addition to scrapping to Article 370, the government also announced to split the state into two union territories— one was J&K with a legislature and second was Ladakh without a legislature. Abrogation of Article 370 was heavily condemned by various stakeholders in the country as well as witnessed scepticism from the international community. The abrogation was followed by a massive clampdown in the Valley, which included a heavy deployment of security forces, arrest of political leaders, including former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, and snapping of internet connections and phones lines. 5. CAA/NRCAfter a heated debate in Parliament, the Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed leading to country-wide protests. The controversial Act grants citizenship status to religious minorities, barring the Muslims, persecuted in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The passage of the Bill led to widespread protest across the country. In several places, the protests turned violent leading to loss of life and property. Opposition parties accused the government of trying to divide the country on communal lines with the introduction of the Act. The government refuted the allegations, claiming that the Act grants refuge to persecuted minorities in neighbouring countries. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Army intensified pro-people activities in J&amp;K after abrogation of Article 370 | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: When Centre revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir nearly five months ago, the Army launched a special operation called ""Mission Reach Out"" to provide assistance to the people and ensure peace in the newly created Union Territory. The mission, thus, became an addition to the multifarious activities carried out by the Army in Jammu and Kashmir over the past three decades to win over the hearts and minds of the residents and wean away the youth from Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, an army officer said. Jammu-based Army PRO Lt Col Devender Anand said the Army has continued with its pro-people activities under operation 'Sadbhavana' (goodwill) despite the challenging situation. He said the activities were intensified when ""Mission Reach Out"" was launched after the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5. ""Take any field, the Army is at the forefront and helping locals, students and unemployed youth to achieve their goals, honing skills of sportsmen by organising sports events and functions to promote communal harmony and providing medical assistance at doorsteps,"" he told PTI. Through the year, which saw tensions along the Line of Control and International Border due to frequent ceasefire violations by Pakistan to push armed infiltrators, the Army stepped up vigil on the borders but kept its focus on reaching out to the people, he said. According to official sources, more than 2,500 incidents of ceasefire violation took place on the borders this year, claiming the lives of 36 Indian nationals. The ceasefire violations by Pakistan intensified after IAF jets destroyed a Jaish-e-Mohammad training camp in Balakot in Pakistan on February 26 in retaliation to the worst-ever terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama district on February 14 that left 40 paramilitary personnel dead. Led by Army chief Gen Bipin Rawat, top army commanders visited the forward posts frequently and reviewed the operational preparedness of the troops in all sectors in the twin Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, Lt Col Anand said. He said the Army chief undertook extensive tours of the Valley, Jammu and Ladakh during the year, while the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command, Lt Gen Ranbir Singh and other senior officers made frequent trips to the forward areas every month. While the army commanders toured the border dozens of times between January and July, the frequency of their visits increased in the subsequent months with August and September together accounting for most of the tours. This included the three-day tour of the Army chief to Srinagar and Jammu in August and later a two-day tour of Leh in September, he said. With the introduction of ""Mission Reach Out"" in August, the Army intensified its civic-action programmes across Jammu and Kashmir to ensure peace and anti-social and anti-national elements are not allowed to mislead the public, the Army PRO said. Lt Col Anand said the Army is running 43 goodwill public schools, where 15,000 students are enrolled, and three specialised training-cum-coaching centres. He said the Army organised over 120 sporting events for the youth. A total of 200 medical camps, 90 veterinary camps, 100 capacity-building tours within and outside Jammu and Kashmir, integrating students and opinion makers to national mainstream were some of the highlights of the Army activities during the outgoing year, he said. He said the Army conducted two major recruitment rallies post August, one each in Samba and Reasi districts in Jammu region, to provide an opportunity to the youth to join the Army. The Army also reached out to ex-soldiers and conducted 35 rallies to address their issues, he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 'Opening of state jobs in J&amp;K to outsiders unacceptable: JKNPP | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers party on Monday accused the Union territory's government of having jeopardized the career of unemployed educated youths in J&K by opening local state jobs for outsiders, asserting that it is ""unacceptable"". In a first step of its kind,   opening the state employment   in the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh for candidates from across the country after nullification of Article 370, the Jammu and Kashmir high court has invited applications from eligible candidates from all over India to fill 33 vacancies with it. After the nullification of Article 370 on August 5 this year, there have been demands from various quarters, especially in Jammu region and the Union Territory of Ladakh, carved out from the erstwhile state of J&K, for a domicile certificate or some legal restrictions on the purchase of land by outsiders as well as their appointments in government jobs. ""It would not only mar the prospects of the local unemployed educated youths but would also have a demoralising effect upon the educated aspiring youths of the erstwhile state,"" JKNPP chairperson Harsh Dev Singh told reporters here. J&K does not have much scope for absorption of educated unemployed youths in the private sector. And the employment opportunities in the government sector are also very limited, said the former education minister. Throwing open government jobs in J&K to youths from all over the country would not only be a grave injustice with the J&K youths but could also have serious ramifications,” said Singh. Not only the Jammu and Kashmir high court has invited applications on all India basis but the J&K Trade Promotion Organization (JKTPO) too has opened employment with it to candidates from all over India, he added. He said the JKTPO managing director had earlier issued an advertisement on December 17 inviting applications for filling up seven posts of 'professional interns' on consolidated remuneration of Rs 25,000 per month from all eligible persons on All India basis. The notification had further said the new appointees shall be entrusted with the task of showcasing J&K's strengths, strategies and potential, said Singh. Accusing the government of having jeopardized the careers of J&K unemployed youths, the JKNPP said the move was fraught with dangerous portends. “The J&K government was hardly advertising any new posts to fill up vacancies in government departments despite the ever growing number of unemployed educated youths year after year. ""The simmering discontent among youths against the government apathy could have earthshaking consequences in case the J&K jobs are opened to outsiders without protecting the interest of local youths” said Singh. Lambasting the BJP for diminishing and marring the career prospects of J&K youths, Singh said it should get prepared to face the fury of youths who had been cajoled and lured by it during elections through its seductive slogans. He said in September also, the BJP had objected to the demand that the posts for police constables should be filled by state's permanent residents only, saying that after the abrogation of Article 370 abrogation, all citizens of the country had become entitled to participate in the selection process in J&K.

 Northern Army Commander visits forward areas in J&amp;K | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: After the escalation of ceasefire violations across the Line of Control (LoC), Northern Army Commander Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh visited Jammu and Kashmir to review the prevailing security situation. Accompanied by Chinar Corps Commander Lieutenant General K.J.S. Dhillon, the Northern Army Commander visited the snowbound forward areas and lauded the troops for inspiring motivation and selfless service in the toughest terrain and climate conditions. He had reached the newly-created Union Territory on Friday to take complete stock of the situation as during winters generally there are very less ceasefire violations. ""But the situation is unusual along the LoC,"" said a senior Indian Army officer. Till December 27, a total 3,200 incidents of ceasefire violations cross the LoC were reported compared to 1,629 in 2018. In December, so far, 330 incidents have been reported which also double compared to last year's 175. Since the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan has increased ceasefire violations. In August, a total 307 incidents were reported, while in September, 292 incidents were registered. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Indian-Americans hold events in New York in support of CAA | India News - Times of India,"NEW YORK: Members of the Indian diaspora held events at different places here to express their support for the amended Citizenship Act, terming it as a historic step taken by the Indian government. According to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship. A group of Indian-Americans gathered at Times Square on Sunday, carrying placards and raising slogans in support of the Narendra Modi government and CAA. The placards read “CAA is about human rights”, “We support minorities' right to live with dignity”, “NRIs support CAA” and “CAA passed by transparent and democratic process.” They raised slogans such as “We support Modi” and “We support CAA.” Attending the support rally was President of Overseas Friends of BJP-USA (OFBJP) Krishna Reddy Anugula and others members of the organization. In Long Island, an event was organized on Saturday where members of the Indian-American community expressed their support for the new law. Jagdish Sewhani, President of the American India Public Affairs Committee, said the law is a historic decision taken after the Narendra Modi government was voted back to power with an overwhelming majority. Sewhani also lauded the Modi government's decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5 to revoke the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir. Addressing the gathering, he said the Indian-American community thanks Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for the “bold decisions taken concerning the Citizenship Amendment Act”. “This act of humanitarianism should have been done years before. But because of pseudo-secularism and vote bank politics, these refugees were forced to live an inhuman life in India. Now CAA gives them an opportunity to have a dignified life in India,” he said. He said the Indian-American community must reach out to Congressmen, Senators and elected representatives in the US to inform them about CAA.

 2019: A year that reshaped Jammu and Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: For Jammu and Kashmir, 2019 was a year of massive changes with defining firsts and lasts and unprecedented curbs. On October 31, Jammu and Kashmir transitioned from a state into two Union territories Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. This was the first time a state was downsized into union territories. The move was in accordance with the Centre's August 5 announcement withdrawing the state's special status under Article 370 and bifurcating the state into Union territories. The erstwhile state also saw its worst-ever terror attack on February 14. Forty CRPF personnel were killed when a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama. The Pulwama incident led to widespread outrage and the Centre vowed to avenge the deaths. On February 26, IAF jets carried out an attack on a Jaish-e-Mohammad training camp at Balakot in Pakistan. It was the first time India carried out any attack inside Pakistani territory since 1971. Pakistan Air Force reacted the next day by carrying out strikes inside Jammu and Kashmir but the Indian Air Force reacted swiftly, leading to an aerial dogfight. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, flying a vintage MiG 21 Bison, shot down a much superior F-16 of the Pakistan Air Force before he was brought down and captured by Pakistan army. He was, however, handed back to India two days later. While there was jubilation across the country over the upper hand gained in the aerial dogfight, IAF lost six officers who were travelling in a helicopter on February 27 when it was brought down by their own colleagues in a case of mistaken identity. The chopper crashed outside a village in Budgam district, resulting in the death of a young civilian as well. The Centre's August 5 move to abrogate provisions of Article 370 was unprecedented and aimed at ending the decades-old separatist movement. To ensure there was no violence, particularly in Kashmir, over the decision, the Centre implemented stringent curbs on people's movement and communication systems. Just ahead of Home Minister Amit Shah's landmark announcement in Rajya Sabha, Jammu and Kashmir, except Leh, was turned into a garrison with security forces and police deployed in every nook and corner with the army also assisting in securing the Srinagar-Jammu national highway. Hundreds of political leaders from both mainstream and separatists camps including three former chief ministers -- Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti -- were taken into preventive custody. Farooq Abdullah, a three-time chief minister, was later booked under Public Safety Act -- a law that was enacted by his father Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978 to deal with timber smugglers but used by subsequent governments to put down militancy and separatist movement after 1990. It was after a gap of more than 60 years that a serving or former head of the government of Jammu and Kashmir was arrested by the authorities. Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, the National Conference founder, was arrested in 1953 when he was the prime minister of Jammu and Kashmir -- a post downgraded to chief minister in 1965. Given the high rhetoric dished out by both mainstream and separatists leaders about any tinkering with the erstwhile state's special status, violence was expected to erupt in the valley and some parts across the Pir Panjal mountain range in Jammu region. The government imposed curfew and strictly implemented it, snapped all means of communication including internet services, suspended the cable TV services and shut down all educational institutions. There were hundreds of incidents of stone pelting in the wake of the Centre's move but strict implementation of curfew meant that large gatherings were avoided and security forces had to deal with protests which were largely localised. While the Centre maintained a veil of secrecy around its intentions, the state government headed by Governor Satya Pal Malik cancelled the Amarnath Yatra midway and issued an advisory for all non locals -- tourists, labourers, etc to leave the valley as soon as possible, sparking off panic among the local residents who feared for the worst. The government's apprehensions of widespread violence were not unfounded as Kashmir had witnessed four summer agitations between 2008 and 2016 due to varied reasons that left nearly 300 people dead. However, the people of Kashmir this time opted for a largely non-violent and silent protest. While the government lifted curfew from almost the entire valley within 15 days of the decision to revoke special status of Jammu and Kashmir, the shutdown in Kashmir longed nearly 120 days. Schools and educational institutions remained closed for this period but examinations were held according to schedule. The year recorded many firsts and lasts. Satya Pal Malik became the last Governor of Jammu and Kashmir state. Girish Chander Murmu was sworn in as the first Lieutenant Governor of Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir on October 31 and former bureaucrat Radha Krishna Mathur as the first Lieutenant Governor of strategically-located Ladakh. With the repeal of Article 370, more than 100 central laws were directly applied to Jammu and Kashmir for the first time and most of the parallel laws enacted by the state assembly were repealed. Several commissions set up under the laws enacted by the state legislature including SHRC were wound up after the notification for creation of Jammu and Kashmir union territory came into effect. With some restrictions still in place in the Valley like curbs on mobile internet, National Conference's Lok Sabha member Hasnain Masoodi questioned the Centre's position that Article 370 was removed to realise the goal of ""one nation, one Constitution"". ""The Northeast is getting assurance daily that the identity and culture of its people will be protected and inner line permit will be respected. This belies the narrative which was marketed that there will be one nation, one law and one Constitution after the revocation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir and abrogation of Article 370,"" Masoodi told PTI. He claimed that the Centre's appeals for peaceful protests and voicing dissent through peaceful manner against the amended citizenship law mean that violence is necessary to get the disapproval and dissent registered in the country. ""The Centre is making appeals to the people across the country, to students that they should voice their disagreement and dissent in a peaceful manner. But when the people of Jammu and Kashmir decided to voice their disagreement and disapproval in a peaceful manner, they refused to register their disapproval on the ground that not a single bullet was fired. Indirectly, it means that violence is necessary to get the disapproval and dissent registered,"" he asserted. While most PDP leaders are detained, Mehbooba Mufti's daughter Iltija Mufti is operating her mother's Twitter account to criticise the government. Commenting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing concern over the violence in the aftermath of the passage of the citizenship law, Iltija wrote, ""If debate and discussion are essential to democracy then why deprive people of J&K of the same rights? For us Kashmiris, its only been division, draconian laws and detentions."" PTI MIJ Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Ousted Srinagar deputy mayor arrested in J&amp;K Bank fraud case | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Friday arrested former deputy mayor of Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) Sheikh Imran in a J&K Bank fraud case. The accused, according to ACB, had taken a loan of Rs 138 crore for illegal appropriation of subsidy under the pretext of establishing a controlled atmosphere (CA) storage at Lassipora in Pulwama district of south Kashmir. Imran, who was removed as deputy mayor of SMC after a no-confidence motion against him on Thursday, was taken to the Shaheed Gunj police station for questioning, an ACB spokesman said. He had been in detention at the MLA Hostel since the nullification of Article 370. Giving details of the case, the spokesman said an FIR was registered by the ACB against Imran, who is the director of Kehwa Square Pvt Ltd, officers of the J&K Bank and other government officials for alleged misappropriation of subsidy with the inflated cost of the CA project. “The Kehwa Group got a loan of Rs 138 crore from the J&K Bank, (got it) restructured for merely an amount of Rs 78 crore under a well-knit conspiracy by Imran and partners of the Kehwa Square Pvt Ltd along with J&K Bank officials,” he said. A joint inspection team of various experts and government officials conducted an inspection of the site and assessed the cost of the project at Rs 33 crore, the ACB spokesman said. The subsidy component was calculated at Rs 16.50 crore – 50% of the estimated project cost (EPC) -- purportedly as per norms of the Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan (HMNEH) states, he said. “The liabilities on account of loan accumulated to Rs 138 crore. Since one of the companies, Kehwa Square, had turned non-performing asset, Imran sought a one-time settlement with the J&K Bank authorities,” the spokesman said. Interestingly, the previous board of directors of the J&K Bank had given its nod for rescheduling the loan. Not just that, the board had also given its consent to allow the defaulter to borrow further to repay only Rs 78 crore, sources within the bank disclosed.

 J&amp;K will be granted statehood in near future: Ram Madhav | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Statehood status will soon be restored to Jammu and Kashmir, according to BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav, who is here on a two-day visit. “The Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir will be granted statehood in the near future. BJP is in favour of granting statehood to J&K as early as the conditions permit,” he said on Friday and added that delimitation will soon be started in the region. “The Delimitation Act will soon be brought into force and the Centre is already working on it and our party also wants to restore statehood status soon to Jammu and Kashmir,” said Madhav, adding that assembly elections in the UT will be announced and conducted by the Election Commission of India depending upon the situation. Madhav also said restrictions in the Valley will be lifted in 2020. “Presently, around 30-32 top leaders are under detention and in total, less than 100 are still detained but they will also be released soon.” “We want political activities, happenings to begin at the earliest,” said Madhav and added that Internet services have been restored in Kargil and in a phased manner will soon be restored in Jammu and Kashmir. This year, he said, was very eventful for people of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh — major decisions were taken in the erstwhile state. Since August 5 when Article 370 was abrogated, the situation has remained peaceful, Madhav said. “There were also fewer incidents of stone-pelting this year, giving an impression of a modified mindset of the youth. Hubs of stone-pelting in the Valley remained calm and peaceful and it happened all because of administration, police and, particularly, the people of the Kashmir Valley, who want to take Union Territory forward.” Strongly denouncing violent demonstrations against the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAA), Madhav said there is nothing against any community in the CAA. “Many refugees are continually getting citizenship of India under normal procedure. Only relaxation of five years is given to minorities from our neighbouring nations,” he said. Madhav described the National Population Register (NPR) as a routine administrative exercise to track the movement of Indian residents. “NPR is the baby of UPA when they were in power and political and communal conspiracy is being undertaken by some elements to disturb situation in the country,” he added.

 Amit Shah challenges Rahul Gandhi to prove CAA has provision for snatching citizensip rights | India News - Times of India,"SHIMLA: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday challenged the opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi to prove that Citizen Amendment Act has the provision of depriving any community of citizenship. “I challenge Rahul Baba to prove where in the Citizenship Amendment Act it has been written that citizenship of minorities would be snatched,” he said, while addressing a public rally held in Shimla to mark completion of two years of BJP government in state. Shah said that opposition should stop the malicious campaign and should not mislead the people of country on Citizenship Amendment Act. Shah said that Citizen Amendment Act has the provision of giving citizenship rights to minority communities coming from neihgbouring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangaldesh. He said that during partition of country, major chunk of Muslim population remained in India while sizeable population of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Christians remained in Pakistan . He said that in 1950 Nehru-Liaquat Agreement was signed under which India and Pakistan both agreed to look after the minorities in their respective territories. “We safeguarded the interests of minorities while neighbouring countries failed to do so and there minorities were suppressed on religion basis and lakhs of people came to India and were not having citizenship rights, jobs and education,” he said. Shah said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the courageous decision to bring Citizenship Amendment Bill to provide citizenship rights to minorities who had come to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He said people should understand that Act is meant to provide citizenship and in no way it is going to snatch the citizenship of anyone. While attacking previous UPA regime for failing to protect the boundaries of nation, Amit Shah said that during previous regime, Army jawans were beheaded as borders were porous. He said when Narendra Modi-led government came to power, Pakistan thought that it can continue with the old trend without knowing that it was not the Congress government but was BJP government. “Pakistan did not know it was not the government of “Mauni Baba but the government of 56 inch wala Modi”. We took the revenge of attack on Uri within 10 days through surgical strike after which perspective of world changed towards us,” he added. He said that it was Modi government that took the decision to scrap Article 370 to unify the country. He said Congress was delaying Ram Janmabhoomi issue but now Supreme Court has given the decision that Ram temple would be constructed at same site. He said during previous UPA regimes Rs 12 lakh crore worth scams took place while Modi government has put an end to such scams and has set the economy of country on the path of becoming 5 trillion economy. He said that 69 national highways were approved for Himachal Pradesh but during the regime of Virbhadra Singh led government in state for two and half years not even a single detailed project report was prepared. “After coming to power, Jai Ram Thakur led government has prepared the detailed project reports of 58 national highways,” he said.

" Congress misleading people, CAA has no provision to take away citizenship: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India","SHIMLA (HIMACHAL PRADESH): nion Home Minister Amit Shah here on Friday hit out at the opposition Congress, accusing the party of misleading people over the amended Citizenship Act. He also clarified that the legislation had no provision to take away citizenship. ""The Congress and company is spreading rumours that Muslims may lose their citizenship,"" said Shah during at rally at the historic Ridge Maidan here to mark the second anniversary of BJP government in the state. ""I challenge Rahul Baba that let me know if there is even a single line in the Act regarding the withdrawal of anyone's citizenship. Don't misguide and divide people over the CAA,"" he added. Amit Shah said he wanted to ask the minorities, especially Muslims, to look into the CAA, which was now available on the government website. ""Go through the Act. No one will lose citizenship,"" he added. The Union minister said the CAA would provide citizenship to the minorities who faced religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Pakistan failed to implement the Nehru-Liaquat pact to protect religious and other rights of the minorities, Shah said, adding that it prompted the Narendra Modi-led BJP government to table the legislation in Parliament. Amit Shah also attended the ground-breaking ceremony of projects worth over Rs 13,500 crores in Shimla.

" Supreme Court's key judgment in 2019: Paving way for Ram Temple, Rafale; clean chit to ex-CJI in harassment claim | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Verdicts paving the way for construction of a Ram Temple at Ayodhya and India's multi-billion dollar Rafale fighter jet deal with France were 2019's landmark imprints of the Supreme Court, which also found itself at the centre of a controversy with then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi being accused of sexual harassment before getting the clean chit. Controversies around former CJIs notwithstanding, Justice (retd) Gogoi was the first head of the judiciary against whom a stunning claim of sexual harassment was made by a former apex court employee. The controversy was put to rest following a clean chit to him by the Supreme Court's In-House Inquiry Committee, headed by present CJI S A Bobde who took charge as head of judiciary this year. The top court also saw a spate of pleas against the Centre's historical move abrogating the provisions of Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and subsequent restrictions and detention of leaders like Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti. A 5-judge Constitution bench has been set up to examine the validity of the Centre's move bifurcating the J&K in two Union Territories. The year would however be remembered for the historic verdict on the centuries old Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute at Ayodhya. A failed mediation put the onus on the top court to resolve the issue. A 5-judge bench, headed by the then CJI Gogoi, heard the parties involved for 40 days -- second longest hearing in its history -- and unanimously cleared the way for construction of temple at the disputed site and directed the Centre to allot a 5-acre plot to Muslims for a mosque. The apex court widened the scope of judicial scrutiny into alleged discrimination against women in various religions by referring to a 7-judge bench the pleas seeking review of its historic 2018 verdict allowing women and girls of all ages to enter Kerala's Sabarimala temple. It said that a larger bench should frame parameters to deal with alleged discrimination against Muslim and Parsi women -- entry of Muslim women into mosques and 'dargah' as also Parsi women, married to non-Parsi men, being barred from the holy fire place of an Agyari. The politically-sensitive Rafale jet case, which kept the Modi government on tenterhooks, ended in favour of the Centre with the apex court upholding its last year's decision and dismissing various review pleas for a CBI probe into inter-governmental India-France pact to procure 36 fully loaded fighter jets from Dassault Aviation. The year also saw the top court shed its reluctance on sharing information under the Right to Information Act, with a path-breaking verdict holding that the CJI's office is a public authority under transparency law and amenable to disclosure. It however put caveats saying that ""judicial independence"" and nature of information has to be kept in mind while disclosing information in ""public interest"". Pleas related to nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, which aims to provide citizenship to persecuted minorities of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, also engaged the top court which referred the issues of alleged police atrocities on protestors to the concerned high courts. It decided however to examine the constitutional validity of CAA by issuing notice to the Centre on 59 pleas filed by various parties, including Congress leader Jairam Ramesh and Indian Union Muslim League. Besides, it monitored the exercise of finalisation of Assam NRC in which 19,06,657 of the total 3,30,27,661 applicants were excluded. The year also saw the Supreme Court take tough stand against rising sexual offences against women and children. It upheld the death sentence of one of the four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case and came up with guidelines for setting up special courts in each district with over 100 FIRs to deal with POCSO cases. Politically influential persons including expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and former Union minister Swami Chinmayanand, accused of sexual offences, found themselves at the receiving end. It transferred the Unnao rape case involving Sengar from a Lucknow court to Delhi's trial court which sentenced him to life term till last breath. It took suo motu (on its own) cognizance on assessment of the criminal justice system in response to sexual offences, saying that despite amendments to law for effective and speedy trials, the NCRB's 2017 data showed 32,559 rape cases being registered in India. In the financial corruption arena, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram repeatedly sought relief from the top court in INX Media cases and was subsequently granted bail after spending over 100 days in custody. Cracking whip on errant builders, the top court cancelled Amrapali Group's registration under realty law RERA, and ousted it from its prime properties in the NCR. It also directed completion of corporate insolvency resolution process for Jaypee Infratech saying the revised resolution plans be invited only from NBCC and Suraksha Realty. Cash-rich BCCI, managed by the apex court appointed Committee of Administrators headed by former CAG Vinod Rai, finally became a free bird as the top court ordered that the elected representatives of the BCCI headed by former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly would take charge to run it. Reliance ADAG Chairman Anil Ambani was held guilty of contempt by the apex court which ordered debt-laden RCom to clear Rs 453 crore dues to Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson or face a 3-month jail term.

From Citizenship Act to Article 370: 2019 a busy year for Ministry of Home Affairs | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: 2019 proved to be a watershed year for the Ministry of Home Affairs with abrogation of provisions of Article 370, enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act, the terror attack in Pulwama and a host of other issues keeping it busy. The year also saw BJP President Amit Shah assuming charge of the crucial ministry and taking a few tough decisions that rocked the country, the subcontinent as well as different parts of the world. Just two months after the Narendra Modi government assumed office for the second consecutive term, Shah on August 5 announced in Rajya Sabha the decision to end the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories. Thus ended one of the most contentious provisions of the Constitution that had allowed a separate flag, a Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir for seven decades. Before this announcement, there was a massive deployment of troops in the Kashmir Valley, a complete clampdown on communication links and detention of hundreds of people, including three former chief ministers — Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti. While landline phones and mobile networks were restored after several weeks, internet services still continue to be suspended and the three chief ministers incarcerated. Before the ""historic step"", as described by the home ministry, was approved by Parliament, Shah had announced that it will end three decades long militancy, bring development and merge Jammu and Kashmir completely with the rest of India. Pakistan angrily reacted to the abrogation of the Article 370 provisions, going to the United Nations with the help of China but in vain. A few countries like Turkey and Malaysia openly criticised India for the decision on Jammu and Kashmir but most countries, including France, Russia and the US stood behind India saying it was an internal matter. The contentious legislation, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), piloted by the MHA under Shah, got the approval of Parliament in the recently concluded Winter Session. But CAA evoked strong protests in different parts of the country for its alleged discriminatory provisions, leading to the death of nearly two dozen people during these demonstrations. According to the Act, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. On February 14, Jammu and Kashmir witnessed one of the worst terror attacks -- blowing up of a CRPF bus by Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammd -- killing 40 jawans. India retaliated by bombing terror camps at Balakot, deep inside Pakistan 12 days later on February 26. The MHA was also busy keeping a close eye on the security situation in the country following the pronouncement of the verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue. The ministry had to deploy additional paramilitary personnel in sensitive places in different parts of the country with close coordination of the state governments. Thankfully, the country saw no major incident as a reaction to the apex court order. The home ministry received flak from different quarters for its move to allow a short-lived BJP-Ajit Pawar government by revoking President's rule in Maharashtra at 5.47 am on November 23 by invoking a special provision of the government of India rules to bypass the requirement of holding a meeting of the Union Cabinet for such a crucial decision. The Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules (12) give the prime minister special powers to recommend revocation of the President's rule post-facto approval of the Union Cabinet. The MHA also took another crucial decision of withdrawing Special Protection Group (SPG) security cover given to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her children Rahul and Priyanka, 28 years after the elite force's continuous deployment, and replacing it with 'Z-plus' security of the CRPF. Weeks later, a bill initiated by Shah was passed by Parliament and it mandated the SPG to guard only the prime minister, his or her immediate family members if they live with him or her. Besides, a former prime minister will be given SPG security only for five years after demitting office and his or her family members only for five years if they live along with him or her. The home ministry initiated another law which got the approval of Parliament under which an individual could be declared as terrorist by the government. Following the enactment of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act, the home ministry declared Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar, Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, Mumbai terror attack accused Zaki-ur-Rehman-Lakhvi and fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim individual terrorists. The four were the first to be declared terrorists under the new anti-law. The home ministry also released a new map of India depicting Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) as part of the newly created Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, while Gilgit-Baltistan is in the UT of Ladakh and within the geographical boundary of India. In November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a dedicated corridor connecting Dera Baba Nanak in Punjab with Kartarpur Sahib gurudwara in Pakistan. Indian pilgrims of all faiths can now undertake round-the- year visa-free travel to the historic gurudwara, the final resting place of founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev ji. A state-of-art passenger terminal building was developed at an estimated project cost Rs 400 crore, having modern public amenities and security features and architecture reflecting cultural heritage of Punjab. A 4.19-km-long, 4-lane highway with a cost of Rs 120.05 crore was built, in record time of six months, on Indian side for giving accessibility for pilgrims to the passenger terminal building. During the South-west Monsoon, a number of states and union territories were affected by floods. As many as 2,391 people lost their lives and over eight lakh houses were damaged during the monsoon this year. According to information received from states and UTs, 2,391 human lives and 15,729 cattle were lost, 8,00,067 houses were damaged and 63.975 lakh hectares of cropped areas were affected due to floods, cloudburst, landslide, the home ministry said. In 2019, the home ministry banned over 1,800 NGOs and academic institutes from receiving foreign funding for violating the provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulations Act.

 PM Narendra Modi sharpens attack on protesters for anti-CAA riots | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday sharpened his attack on anti-CAA protesters for destroying public property in what can further polarise the debate on large-scale violence and the police response. “Can we justify the way people protested and damaged public property after enactment of the citizenship law? People should ask if it was correct. I appeal to people not to fall into the trap of rumours. People do have rights, but they are also duty-bound to protect public property, which is there for future generations. Whatever was torched, was it not for their children’s use?” Modi said. Addressing a gathering that included UP CM Yogi Adityanath, the PM came out strongly in support of police. “People need to respect police, who are there to protect them,” he said in what marked a second public gesture of solidarity with the force since Sunday when he condemned the attacks on security personnel. CAA protests: Editors Guild slam police for 'violence' against journalistsHis remarks contrasted starkly with the stance of BJP’s political opponents as well as activists on the violence. Opposition parties and certain civil society groups have accused BJP governments in states of unleashing repression on protesters. On Atal Bihari Vajpayee's anniversary, PM says rights subject to reasonable curbsThe divergence in depictions of the role of protesters and police in the violence in the rival narratives points to the chasm that the changes in the Citizenship Act have opened up. Modi’s speech to mark the birth anniversary of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee came at a time when UP is in the throes of a political confrontation as well as what looks to be a social divide over the violent anti-CAA protests allegedly involving large-scale use of firearms as well as the unusually tough police response, including   imposition of punitive fines on rioters   for destruction of public property and the alleged vandalisation of personal assets of those responsible for attacks on men in khaki. Modi said the mobs fell prey to rumourmongers, but stressed that rights were subject to reasonable restrictions and could not be pursued in isolation from duties. “Haq ki ek maryada hai... dayra hai, seema hai. Lekin dayitwa ki, kartavya ki bhawna bahut hi vyapak hai (Rights have limits whereas responsibilities and duties have a vast expanse),” the PM said, his pitch reflecting the efforts his government has lately been making to put citizens’ duties on the same footing as the rights they enjoy. Modi also strongly defended the changes in the law to fast-track citizenship for people belonging to religious minorities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who fled to India to avoid persecution, ruling out any backtracking. “Bharat ki 130 crore janata ne Pakistan, Afghanistan aur Bangladesh se aaye sharnarthiyon ki garima ke liye aur unhein angikaar karne ka mann bana liya hai (The 130 crore population of India has decided to accept the minorities who have faced humiliation in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh),” he said. The PM was combative also about his decision to scrap J&K’s special status. Calling Article 370 a “disease” that plagued the development of not only Jammu & Kashmir but also the rest of India for decades, Modi said it was passed on to his government as a legacy and it was solved without even a murmur. Modi also laid stress on peace and tranquillity that ensued following the Supreme Court order giving the disputed land in Ayodhya for the construction of Ram Mandir. “This issue too had festered for long. No protest happened when the judgment on the vexed Ram Janmabhoomi case was announced by the Supreme Court,” he said, adding that India had entered a new decade where intractable problems that had dogged the country for several decades were getting resolved. PM Modi also said the country was moving out of the process of attestation. “Your declaration is enough. All documents, including birth and death certificates, are online now,” PM Modi said. The government had on Tuesday announced that it would accept self-certified documents for enrolment in the National Population Register.

 72 paramilitary companies to be pulled out of Jammu and Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Centre has decided to pull out over 7,000 Central para-military troops from Jammu and Kashmir on account of the improvement in law and order situation there and also because the troops were on short-term deployment, sources told TOI on Tuesday.

 Jharkhand election results: Another state slips out of BJP's control | India News - Times of India,"RANCHI: The Jharkhand results on Monday delivered a morale-boosting victory for the opposition with the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance winning a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81, and another state slipping out of BJP’s hands after its big sweep in the Lok Sabha elections that returned Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a record second term. Hemant Soren of JMM is set to take over as chief minister, returning to the job he held for a year before BJP won in 2015. The oath ceremony will take place on Thursday.   Read also: BJP may have to rethink strategy for state polls  BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014, its decision to contest alone after failed negotiations with regional ally AJSU Party backfiring and the party ceding the status of “single-largest party” for the first time. The contrast to the sweep in the LS elections — BJP won 11 and AJSU one of Jharkhand’s 14 seats — a little over six months ago was astonishing. Till late in the evening, the JMM-led alliance had 47 out of 81 seats. While JMM had 30 seats, Congress had 16 and RJD one. JMM and Congress posted their best-ever shows. Soren, the working president of JMM, won from Dumka and Barhait seats in the tribal heartland of Santhal Pargana. The saffron loss seems to be the fallout of several factors. The break with AJSU Party may have proved critical as the vote share of the two parties — BJP (33%) and AJSU (8%) — suggests that they could have made a fight of it if the alliance had held. Incumbency woes returned to haunt BJP with chief minister Raghubar Das losing his own Jamshedpur East seat to BJP rebel Saryu Roy by a margin of over 15,000 votes.   Read also: Readiness to accept junior role pays off for Congress  The nullification of Article 370, the Ayodhya verdict and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act could not give BJP an edge. Besides Das, BJP state president Laxman Gilua too lost his seat. If the CM suffered from an image problem, his upper hand in government and party also had a negative fallout. The sidelining of rivals led to a dependence on Das and though BJP did not totally lose the development narrative, the lack of a regional ally and the coalescing of tribal sentiment behind the JMM-led alliance proved too strong to overcome. Tenancy act might have alienated tribal votersComing on the heels of the unexpected post-poll loss in Maharashtra, the Jharkhand result means that BJP is out of office in another important state. After its Lok Sabha win, BJP has found the going tough in elections in states where it has been the incumbent, holding on to power in Haryana with the help of Dushyant Chautala’s JJP. In Maharashtra, BJP underperformed in terms of exit poll projections even though it won comfortably in alliance with the Shiv Sena only to face the desertion of its saffron twin. The seeming alienation of the tribal vote, accentuated by the split with the OBC-driven AJSU Party, appears to be a fallout of the misfired attempt to amend the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act. While the intent was to give tribals greater say in disposal of their lands, it was read as an anti-tribal move. JMM and Congress shrewdly exploited this perception and turned a key voter segment towards them. The Jharkhand result saw the opposition claim that BJP’s decision to raise “divisive” issues like CAA and a nationwide NRC has backfired. How such issues can play out in a national election cannot be easily determined, but in the immediate context, they failed to make up for incumbency and a ruptured alliance. BJP’s failure has provided an opportunity for Congress and other opposition parties to argue that there is a space for an anti-BJP narrative and smart alliances can work. Congress functionaries said issues of jobs, food security, agrarian crisis, among others, worked with voters. Congress in-charge RPN Singh said, “The verdict is also a referendum against BJP’s CAA-NRC, Ram temple, Article 370 and 35A in Jammu & Kashmir versus jal, jungle, zameen in Jharkhand.” For the opposition, the key was the smooth manner in which seat-sharing was arrived at with Congress willingly accepting the junior partner’s slot. After some bargaining, Congress also agreed on projecting Hemant Soren as the alliance’s CM face. The alliance that had done so poorly in the Lok Sabha elections — even JMM’s pater familias Shibu Soren lost — bounced back with surprising vigour, taking on BJP and its heavyweight campaigners, PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. While BJP’s use of “national issues”, articulated by Modi and Shah, has been questioned in the light of the results, there is a school of thought in the party that its numbers might have dipped even more if the party had gone local.

"TMC opposed every law we brought to protect dalits, scheduled castes: JP Nadda in Kolkata | Kolkata News - Times of India","KOLKATA: The BJP national working president JP Nadda on Monday came down heavily on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for opposing central laws which protect interest of the “dalits and scheduled castes”. ""Her party has been opposing every law that we brought to safeguard interests of the dalit and SC/STs. Whether it is CAA that gives citizenships to communities like Matua and Rajbanshi or abrogation of Article 370 which empowers the tribals in Ladakh, but Trinamool Congress has been against them. In fact, they have been against the Manas-Sankosh-Teesta-Ganges linking project,” Nadda said in Kolkata addressing a rally to welcome the new citizenship law. Addressing an exhilarated crowd Nadda said, “she had gone to seek blessings of Baroma Binapani Devi (Matua matriarch). But when it was about giving citizenship to them, she opposed the CAA.” He alleged that although pockets in Bengal turned violent when people started protesting the CAA, she never criticised those who created arson. “Clearly, she is doing it to secure her vote bank… It is unfortunate that Mamata Banerjee has always given priority to her politics over national interests,” he added. The party’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh criticised the state police for opening fire at the rallies in Darjeeling during Gorkhaland movement, while remaining inactive during the violent anti-CAA protests. Nadda on Monday led a high-octane 'abhinandan yatra' in Kolkata congratulating prime minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. The rally which started from the Hind cinema at around 2pm, reached Shyambazar at 4.30pm on Monday. “I am overwhelmed to see such a rally. This clearly sends out a signal that people have welcomed the CAA,” Nadda said. He took a dig at the Congress and the Left Front in the same breath for remaining undecisive about the CAA. The rally, which almost choked the Central Avenue on Monday afternoon, witnessed BJP supporters and workers from Kolkata, Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas. Howrah, which has seen some violent anti-CAA protest had the highest turnout. ""Each organisational district was asked to bring 10,000 workers. But there is a spontaneous participation from Howrah,"" said Ashok Singh, a BJP worker from Howrah. Party workers started to gather on the Ganesh Avenue since 11.30am. Matua community had one of the most colourful representation decorated with drums and tridents. Men and women, who were present at every inter-section on the route, showered petals on the rallyists. Rip-roaring slogans welcoming the CAA rent the afternoon air. Heavy police mobilisation was seen at sensitive areas like Mechhua where the crowd remained less aggressive while shouting slogans. “In May this year you have shown them a trailer and I am sure they will get to see the full film in next one and a half years. The rally on Monday is an indication to that,” Nadda said to the crowd. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" With Jharkhand loss, BJP footprint shrinks to half from 2017 peak | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: With Jharkhand joining the growing list of states slipping out of BJP's rule, the party now governs mere 35 per cent of the country's landmass in comparison to over 71 per cent during its peak in 2017 when it was in power in the entire Hindi-speaking heartland. Its string of losses in states despite the massive victory in the April-May Lok Sabha elections may force the party's top brass to revisit its strategy for the assembly polls as it prepares for the upcoming battles in Delhi and Bihar. The percentage of population being governed by the BJP in the states, either on its own or with its allies, now stands at around 43 per cent from over 69 per cent two years back, data analysis show. What may be of more concern to the party is that its graph in state polls has been on a steady decline since 2018 when it lost its bastions of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh besides Rajasthan, and its huge victory in the Lok Sabha elections this year has not translated into gains in states. Political watchers believe that the BJP may have to reconsider its tactic of backing leaders from non-dominant communities in assembly elections, as consolidation of Jat, Maratha and tribal votes against it is seen to be one of the reasons behind its below par performance in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand respectively. Opposition parties did much better than expected in Haryana and Maharashtra, even though the BJP emerged as the single largest party in both the states even while losing many seats compared to its previous tally. The party joined hands with rival Jannayak Janata Party to form the government in Haryana but was outsmarted in Maharashtra by the rival Congress-NCP alliance which joined hands with longtime BJP ally Shiv Sena to come to power at the saffron party's expense. If the Haryana and Maharashtra results gave the BJP something to cling to, its defeat in Jharkhand was absolute as for the first time since the state's formation the party has not emerged as the single largest party. The BJP always emerged as the single largest party in Jharkhand, once jointly with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM). Its face and incumbent chief minister Raghubar Das also appeared headed to defeat to BJP rebel Saryu Roy. In all three state which have gone to the polls since Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the BJP to a landslide win in the general election, the party's vote share has fallen by big margins compared to the Lok Sabha polls. The saffron party's vote share was more than 55 per cent in Jharkhand and 58 per cent in Haryana in the Lok Sabha elections. However, it slumped to 33 per cent and 36 per cent respectively in the assembly polls in these two states, held barely a few months after the general elections. Significantly, the party has suffered losses in states at a time when it has been successful in fulfilling its longstanding ideological promises, including nullifying Article 370, criminalising the practice of triple talaq and enacting Citizenship Amendment Act. The Supreme Court's verdict in favour of building a Ram Temple in Ayodhaya was also a big boost to the BJP. Top party leaders in election rallies spoke at length about these ""achievements"" under the Modi government but the voting returns have been less than what they might have expected.

 Jharkhand rejected misleading politics of Modi-Shah: Ashok Gehlot | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who arrived in the national capital to participate in the Congress' 'Satyagraha' over the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens on Monday, said that earlier the people of Maharashtra and Haryana and now Jharkhand have rejected the misleading politics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. The trend shows that the people are tired of their divisive politics, he added. Speaking to the media at the party headquarters, Gehlot said: ""During the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly polls a message went to the entire country that they (Modi and Shah) are misleading the people on the issues of nationalism, Article 370, and their campaign has no agenda. Rahul Gandhi raised the issues of what the common citizens faced."" Slamming the BJP, the Rajasthan chief minister said that Maharashtra and Haryana gave the message that their ""agenda"" was not going to work. ""The people of Jharkhand were unhappy and everyone knew that the Congress is going to win. They pressed their entire resources into use in Jharkhand but the message of Sonia Gandhi went to the people. The way in which they are misleading the people, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi misled the people from Ramlila Maidan, but we got a clear mandate in Jharkhand,"" he said. His remarks came as the results from Jharkhand showed that the Grand Alliance comprising the Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) was set to form the government. To a question on the Prime Minister referring to him during a rally in Delhi's Ramlila Maidan over the CAA issue, the Congress leader said: ""Amit Shah mentioned in the Rajya Sabha, referring to my name, about writing a letter to the then Home Minister. He is misleading the people of the country."" ""I have a copy of the letter in which I said to the earlier Central government that a lot of refugees stay near the Barmer border in Rajasthan and about 99 per cent of them are Hindus or Sikhs. Earlier, the District Magistrate was empowered to give citizenship after they stayed for two years in the state. ""So during my tenure when it was demanded by the people, I wrote the letter to then home minister P Chidambaram. But I don't know what kind of love the Prime Minister and Home Minister have for me that they take my name in their interviews and in their election rallies,"" Gehlot said. Lambasting the Central government over the CAA, he said, ""The government is scared."" Lashing out at Modi and Shah, the Congress leader asked, ""Who said to bring NRC? The Prime Minister said that we didn't have discussions over the NRC. The people are confused as the home minister has said that we will implement the NRC across the country.""

" PM Modi's Delhi speech a bundle of untruths, say Left parties | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Left parties slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday for ""lying"" about the NRC and claimed that he was ""rattled"" by the intensity of the protests across the country against the amended Citizenship Act and the population register. Modi, at a rally here on Sunday, said there was no discussion on a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) anywhere and assured the Muslim community that no one needed to worry about the new law. ""Clearly rattled by the intensity of popular protests across the country against the CAA/NRC/NPR and the declaration by at least 10 chief ministers that they will not implement the NRC, PM Modi unleashed yesterday at Delhi a bundle of untruths aimed at misleading the people. ""BJP's 2019 election manifesto promised the NRC all over the country,"" a statement from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said. Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D Raja said while the Prime Minister had stated that the NRC was not on the government's agenda, home minister Amit Shah and other leaders had spoken out about it, even in Parliament. ""Modi did not participate in the debate on such a critical legislation (CAA). The home minister was piloting the bills - CAB and the one on Article 370. Now the Prime Minister says that it is not a government agenda. Then who is speaking the truth and who is spreading lies? ""If what the Prime Minister has said is true, then will the government stop working on an NPR? We demand that the CAA be repealed, the NRC not be extended to the entire country and the NPR process stopped,"" he said. Both the parties highlighted the discrepancies in Modi's statements and the earlier mentions of the NRC by Shah. They said Shah, during a debate on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) in the Lok Sabha on November 9, had said the government will implement the NRC across the country, while asserting that ""not a single infiltrator will be spared"", while Modi had stated that it was not discussed. They also questioned how the Prime Minister said there were no detention centres anywhere when the minister of state for home affairs, in a reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha on December 11, said instructions were issued to all the states for setting up detention centres to detain illegal immigrants or convicted foreigners, pending deportation. The Centre had, on January 9, sent consolidated instructions for the construction of detention centres to all states and Union territories, they said. The CPM, in its statement, said the Centre told the Karnataka high court on November 28 that it had written to all the state governments in 2014 and shot off a follow-up letter in 2018 to have detention centres to house foreign nationals illegally staying in India. ""During his 90-minute-long speech, Modi did not mention even once the growing miseries that his government and policies are imposing on people's day-to-day life. The economy is in a virtual recession, unemployment is at the highest in half-a-century. Distress suicides by farmers are growing, inflation is eating into people's lives -- people have stopped eating onions due to its exorbitant price. ""Clearly, the Modi government's only agenda is to sharpen communal polarisation and divide our people through the spread of hate and violence. The protests against the CAA/NRC/NPR will continue until an official notification is issued to stop the ongoing process,"" the statement said.

Subrahmanyam Jaishankar: Jayapal added to list of US lawmakers to meet Jaishankar without Engel's approval | World News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON-Congressman Eliot Engel, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was not aware of the inclusion of non-member Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and two others to the list of the lawmakers to meet the visiting External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, here last week, sources said. During his visit to Washington for the 2+2 US-India dialogue, Jaishankar had refused to meet Jayapal who had introduced a Congressional resolution on Kashmir urging India to lift all the restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir imposed after the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5. Engel, the Democratic lawmaker from New York, who along with Ranking Member Michael McCaul, were initially scheduled to meet Jaishankar on December 18, is believed to have come to know about the addition to the team only after the Indian Embassy here objected to the changes what was initially agreed upon, sources told PTI. But by then, the morning of December 18, when Engel came to know about it, it was too late for him and it would have been quite inappropriate for him to take any step that could have been seen as going against his own Congressional colleagues, they said. The Indian Embassy, miffed at the manner in which additional names of lawmakers who were not even members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee were added without keeping into confidence, cancelled the meeting, the sources said. Multiple sources privy to the deliberations here last week indicate that in addition to Jayapal, the list included two other lawmakers who are part of the same group and in the recent past have been hostile in their attitude with India on issues of Kashmir, human rights and religious freedom. The PTI was not able to independently verify the name of the two other lawmakers. Before his arrival in the US to attend the 2+2 dialogue on December 18, Jaishankar had requested a meeting with the leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which are essentially the heads of the lawmakers from two parties – Democratic and Republican -- in those two committees. In the Senate, the Republcian Senator is the Chairman and the Democratic lawmaker is the Ranking Member. It is just the opposite in the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Jaishankar's meeting with the Senate committee went as per the schedule. Notably, the House meeting was scheduled at the same time when President Donald Trump agreed to meet Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in his Oval Office. It was initially planned to be just a courtesy call and a photo opp. But Trump, reportedly in a cheerful mood, that too on a impeachment day, went beyond his schedule and spent some 40 minutes with the visiting Indian leaders. In such a scenario, the meeting with the House Foreign Affairs Committee leadership would not have had happened anyway, the sources said. In its communication, the Indian Embassy asserted that the External Affairs Minister had only sought meetings with the leadership of the Foreign Affairs Committee and that is what was agreed upon. The embassy reportedly queried about the rational of adding at least one and possibly three non-members to the list and cancelled the meeting upon getting unsatisfactory response. In an interview to PTI last week, eminent Indian-American Bharat Barai, who has engaged with Jayapal in the past on her Kashmir resolution, alleged that Jayapal probably wanted to indulge in a heated argument with Jaishankar and then go to the media and get propaganda out of it. The Chennai-born first-ever Indian-American woman elected to the House of Representatives, has been one of the few lawmakers who are mostly from the Democratic Party raising their voices against the Indian government's move on Jammu and Kashmir. Jayapal, 54, ignored the voices of the diaspora from across the country as she went ahead with her pre-announced plans to introduce a resolution on Kashmir in the House of Representatives early this month. The resolution, introduced in the House of Representatives after several weeks of efforts by Jayapal, urges India to lift as swiftly as possible all restrictions on communications in Jammu and Kashmir which were imposed following the abrogation of Article 370. It also urges to preserve religious freedom for all residents. India has defended the restrictions in Kashmir on the grounds that they were imposed to prevent Pakistan from creating more mischief through proxies and terrorists following the abrogation of Article 370 which ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

 Abrogation of Article 370 must be seen as redemption of J&amp;K on path of progress: Venkaiah Naidu | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Vice President Venkaiah Naidu on Monday asserted that revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, which suffered from a developmental deficit for decades, must be seen as the region's redemption on the path of progress.  Vice President Naidu took to Twitter and said, ""For decades Jammu and Kashmir region has suffered developmental deficit due to terrorism. Abrogation of Article 370 must be seen as the redemption of Jammu and Kashmir on the path of progress.""  He said that the cross-border militancy has spoiled the prospects of an entire generation of bright local youth. ""We cannot let this continue. It [Article 370] was a temporary provision that has long outlived its utility. Its abrogation was essential to fast-track the progress of the region,"" he tweeted.  The central government had, in August this year, announced the decision to scrap Article 370 of the Constitution which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the state into two Union Territories.  Jammu and Kashmir is the ""crown of India"", the Vice President said, adding that it is blessed by nature with snow-capped mountains, lush green valleys, and pristine streams.  ""Kashmir has always been known for the friendly nature of its people, their sublime spiritual tradition, the exquisite cuisines, attires, culture, and music,"" he added.  Giving a push to the region's tourism, Naidu said that travel is a method of learning. ""You get to see the diversity of our great country and appreciate the thread of cultural and emotional unity underneath this diversity.""  He also interacted with a score of students from Jammu and Kashmir at the Uparashtrapati Niwas today.  ""I commend the Indian Army for arranging this visit of young students from Jammu and Kashmir.

""...Now with the Citizens Amendment Act, all those Indians who want a pluralist India are beginning to protest & it is becoming a mass movement,"" Khan said on the massive protests in India against the new citizenship law. Khan said that as the protests in India are increasing, ""threat to Pakistan from India is also increasing"" and the Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat's remarks on the situation along the Line of Control adds to Pakistan's ""concerns of a false flag operation"". General Rawat on Wednesday said that the situation along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir can escalate any time and the Army is ready for any ""escalatory matrix"". Gen Rawat's remarks came in the backdrop of spurt in ceasefire violation by Pakistan along the LoC since the abrogation of Article 370 in August. Khan warned the international community that ""Pakistan will have no option but to give a befitting response"" to India if New Delhi undertakes any operation against it. ""I have been warning the int community of this for some time & am reiterating again: if India does such an operation to divert attention from its domestic chaos plus whip up war hysteria to mobilise Hindu nationalism, Pak will have no option but to give a befitting response,"" he tweeted. Earlier, Pakistan Army spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor had termed Gen Rawat's remarks as a tactic to take the global attention away from domestic issues. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status by scrapping provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution. Prime minister Khan had criticised the amended citizenship law and said it ""violates all norms of international human rights law and bilateral agreements with Pakistan"" and that ""it is part of the RSS Hindu Rashtra design of expansionism."" India lambasted Prime Minister Khan, saying such ""unwarranted"" criticism cannot absolve Pakistan of the ""blatant persecution"" of religious minorities.

""I have an interest in meeting people who are objective and open to discussion but not the people who already made up their minds,"" Jaishankar said in response.  According to a report in The Washington Post, Jaishankar ""abruptly cancelled a meeting with senior members of Congress this week after US lawmakers refused demands to exclude"" Jayapal from the meeting.  Jaishankar was to meet chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Eliot L Engel; committee's top Republican Michael McCaul and others, including Congresswoman Jayapal, the report said.  ""This only furthers the idea that the Indian government isn't willing to listen to any dissent at all. The seriousness of this moment should've been a reason for a conversation, not dictating who's in the meeting, which seems very petty,"" Jayapal was quoted as saying by The Washington Post.  However, Congressional sources familiar with the deliberations said that the meeting was cancelled as House Foreign Affairs Committee kept on changing the ground rules of the meeting and kept on adding new members to the list.  A day before the meeting they added Jayapal and several other lawmakers who were known India-bashers and sponsors of the Congressional resolutions on Kashmir.  The Indian Embassy did not respond to questions. However, earlier in the day, Jaishankar had explained, in response to a different question, his reasons for not meeting lawmakers who are not objective and are biased.  Responding to a question, Jaishankar said that the Indian government had no problem with the Democrats and it has a very strong relationship with them.  ""No, I don't think so. Honestly, I don't think so. My own sense is that support for the relationship is extremely strong in a very, very wide cross section members of Congress and political leaders outside the Congress,"" he said.  ""So, I wouldn't take a few voices and necessarily reach a sweeping conclusion, which your question seems to suggest,"" the minister said when asked if India has a problem with the Democrats.  ""I'm not personalising this. I don't want to get into names. All I'm saying is we have always operated in this country because we are always engaged with everybody (who) was reasonable and open minded,"" Jaishankar said.  In addition to his 2+2 ministerial, bilateral and those at the White House meetings, Jaishankar also met leadership of the senate foreign relations affairs committee including its chairman senator James E Risch and ranking member senator Bob Menendez.  On the eve of the ministerial, he also met some of the key members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee including Congressmen Ami Bera and Brad Sherman from the Democratic party and Ted Yoho and Francis Rooney from the Republican Party.

 India has deployed missiles: Pak to UN | India News - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has written another letter to the UN Secretary General claiming that India has deployed and tested several types of missiles and could launch an attack against his country to divert world’s attention from the “grave situation” in Kashmir. In his seventh letter written on December 12, Qureshi “apprised the UN Security Council and the UN Secretary General on Indian actions that continue to escalate tensions in an already tense environment in South Asia”, the Foreign Office said on Wednesday. The actions, Qureshi claimed, included “deployment and testing of missiles of various ranges and capabilities” by India. He also warned that India could launch “false flag” attack on Pakistan to divert the world’s attention from the “grave situation” in Kashmir. In a series of letters sent in the recent months, Qureshi has consistently updated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on the situation in Kashmir, the Foreign Office said. Qureshi also reiterated Pakistan’s proposal to strengthen the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan’s (UNMOGIP) presence in the region. India maintains that the UNMOGIP, established in January 1949, has outlived its utility and is irrelevant after the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the Line of Control. The foreign minister also asked the UNSC to intervene and avert any threats to peace in South Asia and bring an immediate end to the suffering of the Kashmiri people. The earlier letters by Qureshi to the UNSC and UN Secretary General were on August 1,6,13 and 26, September 16 and October 31. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Do not conduct trials in undue haste: SC | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Expeditious trial was required in criminal matters but it should not be conducted in undue haste without giving reasonable time to the accused to defend himself, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday while setting aside the order of a trial court which wrapped up proceedings within a fortnight and awarded death sentence to the accused in a rape-cum-murder case of a nine-year-old girl in 2013. After examining the case records, a bench of Justices U U Lalit, Indu Malhotra and Krishna Murari said the defence lawyer, appointed through Legal Aid Services to represent the accused, was not given sufficient time to interact with the accused and go through the evidence and records of the case. It also said the trial court did not wait for forensic and DNA reports. Holding that such expeditious disposal left glaring gaps in trial proceedings, the bench directed that fresh hearing be conducted by the trial court. “Expeditious disposal is undoubtedly required in criminal matters and that would naturally be part of guarantee of fair trial. However, the attempts to expedite the process should not be at the expense of the basic elements of fairness and opportunity to the accused, on which postulates the entire criminal administration of justice is founded. In the pursuit for expeditious disposal, the cause of justice must never be allowed to suffer or be sacrificed. What is paramount is the cause of justice and keeping the basic ingredients which secure that as a core idea and ideal, the process may be expedited, but fast-tracking of process must never ever result in burying the cause of justice,” the bench said. The bench added that courts must be cautious in matters where death sentence could be one of the punishments and courts must be vigilant and see that full opportunity at every stage is afforded to the accused. “There are other issues which also arise in the matter, namely that the examination of 13 witnesses within seven days, the examination of the accused under the provisions of Section 313 even before complete evidence was led by the prosecution, and not waiting for the FSL and DNA reports in the present case. DNA report definitely formed the foundation of discussion by the HC. However, the record shows that the DNA report was received almost at the fag end of the matter, and after such receipt, though technically an opportunity was given to the accused, the issue on the point was concluded the very same day,” the bench said. In order to ensure that poor accused did not suffer for not taking the services of a good lawyer, the bench said only advocates with minim- um 10 years practice would be appointed amicus in all cases in trial court where there is a possibility of life sentence or death sentence. “In all matters dealt with by the HC concerning confirmation of death sentence, senior advocates of the court must first be considered to be appointed as amicus curiae,” it added.

" 136 days after Art 370 nullification, mosque committee opens Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid for namaz | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: The Anjuman-e-Auqaf (masjid management committee) opened the doors of the Jamia Masjid here on Wednesday, two days ahead of the main Friday prayers, and allowed people to offer namaz there for the first time since the nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution —a gap of 136 days. Although both the civil and police authorities had been asking the masjid committee for the last one month to open the Jamia Majid here for prayers, the committee, headed by top cleric and Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, had avoided opening the mosque for prayers. The minarets of the historic Jamia Masjid in Srinagar’s Old City reverberated with the afternoon prayer calls (Zuhr and Asr) on Wednesday as the Anjuman-e-Auqaf started cleaning the mosque as it had remained closed for 136 days. Around 100 people offered prayers in the mosque. “I was surprised to hear the azaan (prayer call) for Zuhr prayers from Jamia Masjid’s minarets. I was so delighted and right away rushed towards the masjid,” said Bilal Ahmed Phaboo, a resident of Nowhatta. A senior Auqaf member told reporters: “We were demanding the moving out of the security forces from near the main gates of the grand mosque, to which the authorities agreed. As such, we decided to clean the masjid and offered Zuhr prayers first. “Asr prayers were also offered at the masjid. We are hopeful that Friday congregational prayers will also be offered at the Masjid.” Emotional scenes were also witnessed at the masjid with elderly men and women kissing the pillars and walls of the mosque and saying that “this masjid is a spiritual centre for people across Kashmir”. There has been a tussle between the Auqaf and the authorities over holding of prayers at the Jamia Masjid for the last one month. Security officials had been maintaining that there were no restrictions on holding Friday congregational prayers, but the Jamia managing body had been sticking to their stand that until forces were removed from the masjid, prayers could not be organised there. The authorities had lifted restrictions a month ago from most parts of downtown Srinagar last month, including the Nowhatta area around Jamia Masjid.

 Situation along LoC can escalate any time: Army chief Bipin Rawat | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India has to be prepared for escalation in the situation along the Line of Control with Pakistan, said Army chief General Bipin Rawat on Wednesday, even as the Pakistan army continues to attempt BAT (border action team) operations as well as indulge in heavy cross-border firing after J&K’s special status was abrogated in August. ""The situation along the LoC can escalate any time. We have to be prepared for the spiraling of the escalatory matrix,"" said General Rawat. The Army is maintaining a high level of operational readiness, with detailed plans chalked out to cater for different contingencies. The statement comes barely a couple of days after the Army thwarted yet another BAT operation by the Pakistan Army in the Sunderbani sector along the LoC but lost a soldier while another one was injured in the heavy exchange of firing on Monday. ""Pakistan is attempting BAT actions almost every third day. We keep on foiling them and taking retaliatory action,” said a source. This has been a particularly violent year along the 778-km LoC, with as many as 2,900 ceasefire violations (CFVs) also being recorded till now to break all annual records since 2003. The number of CFVs was 971 in 2017 and 1,629 in 2018. The intensity of the cross-border firings, with both sides often deploying heavy mortars, anti-tank guided missiles and artillery guns, first registered a major spike after IAF fighters conducted the pre-dawn air strikes on the major Jaish-e-Mohammed facility at Balakot in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan on February 26. Pakistan had retaliated on February 27 by sending a “strike package” of 24 fighters, including F-16s, JF-17s and Mirage-5 attack jets, to target Indian military installations in the Nowshera sector across the LoC, which included a brigade headquarters and an ammunition dump. Though the IAF had foiled the attempt, it lost the MiG-21 being flown by Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman. “If the Pakistani fighters had managed to hit an important target like an ammunition dump, we would have definitely taken strong retaliatory action. We were prepared for escalation,” said the source.

"DMK takes out protests across Tamil Nadu over CAA, corners BJP, AIADMK | Chennai News - Times of India","CHENNAI: The DMK on Tuesday organised protests across the state against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Party president M K Stalin led the protest at Kancheepuram and condemned the AIADMK for supporting the CAB in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Party MPs, MLAs and district secretaries led the protests. “Had the lone AIADMK MP in Lok Sabha and 11 MPs in Rajya Sabha voted against the bill, there wouldn’t be protests and violence against the Act across the country as is being seen now because the bill would have been defeated. The AIADMK has betrayed Tamil people,” said Stalin. “On the one side, Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks about ‘yadhum oorey yavarum kelir’ in the US. But I want to ask him what is the need for passing the CAA in India now when he quotes Thiruvalluvar and other Tamil poets abroad to claim that all are equal?” asked Stalin. About 10,000 people participated in the protest in Kancheepuram. “Union home minister Amit Shah says he is ready to rejig the Act. He should convene an all-party meeting and discuss the Act. The CAA is an Act of discrimination against Muslims and Sri Lankan Tamils,” charged Stalin. “Why shouldn’t Sri Lankan refugees living in Tamil Nadu for the past three decades get Indian citizenship? Shah reeled out data in Parliament to say that several lakh Tamils have got citizenship. Only Indian Tamils, who were settled in Sri Lanka, were given citizenship. Lankan Tamil refugees staying in Tamil Nadu have not been given citizenship,” said Stalin. Had the Centre bothered about Indian citizens, the economy would not have slumped and people would not be suffering without employment opportunity. “Modi made several promises in 2014. Has he fulfilled anything in the last five years? His contribution is a sagging economy. After scrapping Article 370 and keeping Kashmir leaders under house arrest, the CAA is another onslaught on the people. Is not Sri Lanka a neighbouring country? For Shah, only Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are neighbouring countries,” said Stalin. He said the DMK and other allies would meet on Wednesday and decide the next course of action against the CAA. Unlike the AIADMK, which has surrendered to the BJP, Stalin said the DMK would not leave the issue. The party would sustain the protests, he said.

I asked the world to take notice of this in my address to the UNGA."" The Indian government has said that the abrogation of Article 370 was in the interests of the residents of Jammu and Kashmir.

 UN Security Council not to discuss Kashmir issue today | India News - Times of India,"UNITED NATIONS/NEW DELHI: China is again understood to have requested a discussion in the UN Security Council on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday but diplomatic sources said the issue will not be discussed in the Council. It is learnt that Pakistan's all-weather ally Beijing has called for the issue of Jammu and Kashmir to be discussed in the 15-nation Council on Tuesday. The matter was earlier expected to be discussed in the Security Council Consultations Room under ""other matters"" during closed consultations on Tuesday afternoon. However, it is now understood that due to subsequent developments, this matter is not likely to come up on Tuesday as earlier planned. French diplomatic sources said Kashmir will not be discussed in the Security Council on Tuesday. ""Our position has been very clear: Kashmir issue has to be discussed bilaterally. We have highlighted this several times recently, including in the UN,"" a source said. In the days following the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in August, China had formally asked for closed consultations in the Security Council to discuss India's move to revoke the special status of Kashmir after Pakistan wrote a letter on the issue to Poland, the council president for the month of August. The rare closed consultations on Kashmir by the Security Council on August 16 ended without any outcome or statement from the powerful UN organ, dealing a huge snub to Pakistan's efforts, backed by China, to internationalise the Kashmir issue, which an overwhelming majority in the Council stressed is a bilateral matter between New Delhi and Islamabad. The informal closed consultations on August 16 lasted over an hour after which China's ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun and Pakistan's then UN envoy Maleeha Lodhi made remarks to the media at the Security Council stakeout one by one. The two left without taking any questions from the reporters present. India's Permanent Representative to the UN ambassador Syed Akbaruddin, speaking to reporters at the Security Council stake-out following the August 16 meeting, had said that India's national position was and remains that matters related to Article 370 of the Indian Constitution ""are entirely an internal matter of India.

" Congress, allies stoking violence, says PM Modi | India News - Times of India","DUMKA/RANCHI: PM Narendra Modi on Sunday accused Congress and its allies of stoking violence in the name of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Speaking at a BJP rally in Dumka ahead of the last phase of elections in Jharkhand, Modi referred to vandalism and arson that began in Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya and later spread to Bengal and Delhi. “When Congress and its friends couldn’t stall the Citizen Amendment Bill in both Houses of Parliament, they resorted to such tactics.” “Going by the visuals on television, it is evident who is behind all these protests,” Modi said. “They can be identified by the clothes they are wearing. The entire nation is watching the way Congress and its allies are extending support to such flare-ups. The nation will not spare them,” he added. Modi, who termed the Centre’s decision to amend CAA as “1000% correct”, also accused Congress of shaming the nation by staging protests outside the High Commission of India in London on Saturday as part of its ‘Bharat Bachao Rally’. Referring to anti-India protests a few weeks ago, he said: “Earlier, Pakistan and its sponsored stooges used to protest outside the High Commission of India in London. They did so after the abrogation of Article 370 as well as after the SC’s verdict in the Ayodhya case. But this time, it (Congress) has shamed the entire country before the world by staging protests outside the High Commission of India against CAA. It’s a shame.” Modi said that in their effort to oppose him and BJP, Congress and its allies have now started ‘defaming’ the country. He said Congress has become so “blinded in their efforts to oppose BJP, that it doesn’t realise it is shaming the nation”. The PM accused Congress and its Jharkhand ally JMM of looting the tribals to fill their own coffers. “Neither Congress nor JMM has any roadmap or intention to work for the tribals.

" Detained netas of Kashmir to be freed soon, says Ram Madhav | India News - Times of India","CHANDIGARH: BJP general secretary Ram Madhav on Sunday used a Hindi proverb to emphasise that tough action was required against Kashmiri separatists. “Laaton ke bhoot baaton se nahi mante,” he said during a panel discussion here in response to a point raised by former RAW chief A S Dulat that the Kashmir problem cannot be resolved without talks and negotiations. He also said they wanted that detained political leaders in J&K come out and resume their political activity. Several opposition leaders, including NC chief Farooq Abdullah; his son and former CM Omar Abdullah; and ex-PDP CM Mehbooba Mufti are among those under detention since August 5. “Very soon, we want to allow them to come out,” Madhav said on the concluding day of the Military Literature Festival here. Madhav, however, claimed that detention of all political leaders does not mean they are anti-national. “Their arrest is under preventive detention and they would be released soon,” he said during the debate on ‘Article 370 and the Death-Knell of Terrorism’. When asked if he can specify the time period by which the detained politicians will be released, Madhav said, “See, it is a process which is going on continuously. We have allowed some four to five senior leaders to go and resume their activities. They have been freed from the preventive detention, like that the process will go on”. When Dulat argued that the Centre should adopt former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s vision of Kashmiriyat and should talk and negotiate with all sections in J&K, Madhav said, “Nobody needs to teach the government that we should negotiate.” He said the real definition of ‘Kashmiriyat’ would be “when we see Kashmiri Pandits returning to their homes”.

" No question of extending Article 371 to J&amp;K, says Centre | India News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: The Central government does not intend to extend Article 371 of the Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, Union minister Jitendra Singh said on Sunday. ""There is no question Article 371 is going to be implemented in Jammu and Kashmir,"" Singh said. ""There is nothing of that sort being contemplated at any level by the government of India and this disinformation is being planted by those whose illegitimate interests have been adversely affected by the abrogation of Article 370,"" he said. Article 371, which has special provisions and is applicable in some states especially in the Northeast, safeguards the rights of native people with regard to religious or social practices, customary laws and procedures, ownership and transfer of land and resources, and employment and education. The J&K administration also said on Sunday that there was no proposal to extend Article 371-like provisions to the newly created union territory. An official spokesman said in Jammu that media reports about possible extension of Article 371 to the UT of Jammu and Kashmir were baseless as there was no such proposal so far. The Union Home Affairs Ministry has also refuted any such claims, the J&K administration's spokesperson said. Addressing an event at the Indian School of Business (ISB) here, minister of state Singh said Central laws are automatically applicable to the two newly created Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh and the necessary notifications whenever required are being issued one after the other. Reiterating that Article 370 is ""gone forever as a whole"", he said there is a basic difference between the essence and spirit of Article 370 which has been revoked from Jammu and Kashmir and Article 371 which is applicable in certain areas of the Northeast. Under Article 370 of the Constitution, the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was given special status till its abrogation on August 5. ""Certain fringe elements are trying to create confusion for vested interests by planting disinformation in the media that certain laws or acts will not be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir or applicable there only in truncated form. ""The elements spreading such disinformation are tactically supported by the Congress and the National Conference which have been the beneficiaries of Article 370,"" he said. Singh said the vested interests will have to ""swallow a bitter pill"" whether they like it or not. However, the minister said it is the duty of ""all patriotic, nationalistic and right-thinking citizens"" to cooperate in smooth implementation of the same laws and rules which are applicable in the rest of India. He said that while in case of states, there may be some leverage for the respective state governments, in the case of a Union Territory the Centre's laws are applicable. Giving an example, he said that while law and order and police are state subjects in the case of states, in case of a Union Territory these fall in the domain of Union Home Ministry.

"Abrogation of Article 370, Ayodhya verdict, citizenship act, NRC all steps leading India to Hindu Rashtra: Dal Khalsa | Ludhiana News - Times of India","JALANDHAR: Amid raging debate on CAB and NRC, Sikh group Dal Khalsa has alleged that Narendra Modi government was clearly riding anti-Muslim plank while hurriedly working on its agenda to transform India into a Hindu Rashtra. Condemning the recently amended Citizenship Act, the organization said that targeting one minority and appeasing another is an old and time-tested tactic of the Indian state. “First, it was the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir. Then came a much debated verdict on Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. This has been followed by an amendment to the citizenship act and the national register for citizenship (NRC) is next on the cards. All these are clear signs of the BJP’s march towards a Hindu Rashtra,” said Dal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwarpal Singh. “Just because Sikhs are protected under citizenship act does not mean that we do not understand the malafide intentions of the Union government led by RSS/BJP”, he said. He argued that the series of events in the recent past point towards the plight of religious minorities in India. The need of the hour is the working unity among oppressed people from Kashmir to all the northeastern states, he added. “The CAB has disturbed all the minorities and has instilled insecurity among them. Is there any place in the developed world where asylum seekers are excluded on the basis of their religion?” Dal Khalsa leader asked. He said that the Sikhs had spoken in the past for Kashmiris and would continue to speak out for the Muslims who were being targeted. He said that his organization was supporting the countrywide protests against policies of the Narendra Modi government. Deriding the leadership of Shiromani Akali Dal that has celebrated 99th foundation day of the party last day, Kanwar Pal Singh said Badals took two decisions in 2019 and both were against the spirit and constitution of the party. Akalis sided with BJP to deprive Jammu and Kashmir of its statehood and special status and exclude Muslims from the Citizenship Amendment Act. “Badals have deviated from the core values and objectives of the Akali Dal and in the process, they have lost the moral right to demand and struggle for political autonomy for Punjab,” he added.

 Broadband internet services will be restored on 'limited scale' in Kashmir: Police chief | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police Dilbag Singh has said broadband internet service in the valley will be restored on a ""limited scale"" in the coming days. ""Curbs have been relaxed to a large extent. Phones are working (in Kashmir Valley). Broadband is functional in all districts of Jammu and we are thinking of restoring this facility, wherever possible, on a limited scale in Kashmir in the coming days,"" the police chief told reporters on the sidelines of a function in Kathua district on the weekend. However, he remained non-committal on the release of political leaders, including three former chief ministers, who are under detention since August 5 when the Centre revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and reorganised the state into two Union Territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Internet services across all platforms continue to remain suspended in the valley, along with prepaid phone service. On December 4, Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor G C Murmu had said that internet services would be restored in Kashmir in phases once the situation turns ""more normal"", but gave no timeline. Asked when detained political leaders would be released, the DGP said, ""It is difficult to speak on this at the moment. We will inform you when there will be something."" Almost the entire mainstream political leadership in the valley, including three former chief ministers -- National Conference president Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti -- have been under detention since August 5. Landline phones were the first to be restored in the valley on August 25 followed by post-paid mobile phones after a gap of 72 days on October 14. However, SMS facilities were stopped within a few hours after the Army claimed terrorists were using the services to mobilise people. Over 25 lakh prepaid mobile phones and internet services remain suspended. There has been a growing demand for restoration of internet services, especially from media, business and student communities. Earlier, officials had said there are apprehensions that vested interests might misuse internet services to create a law and order situation in the valley and a decision to restore these facilities would be taken at an appropriate time after assessing the situation.

VD Savarkar’s children want to pick who’s Indian: Umar Khalid | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Activists and student leaders, including ex-IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan, ex-JNU student leader Umar Khalid and TISS student leader Fahad Ahmad joined Samajwadi Party leaders on Saturday to call for a boycott of the Constitutional Amendment Act and the NRC process. The activists have planned a morcha at Girgaum Chowpatty on December 19 with Left parties. Addressing around 5,000 anti-CAA protesters at Azad Maidan, the activists and politicians said “the Modi-Shah” government would be forced to take back CAA and stop the NRC process. “We boycott CAA and will not submit our documents. We are ready to start a civil disobedience movement. Be ready to fill the jails,” said SP MLA Abu Asim Azmi. Khalid said Muslims had proved their loyalty in 1947 when they chose India and rejected Pakistan. In a Rahul Gandhi-like reference to VD Savarkar, he said, “The children of leaders who wrote mercy petitions to the Raj and promised to break the nationalist movement want to decide who is Indian and who’s not.

" 15-year residency to be must for owning land in J&amp;K, Ladakh? | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The government has denied any move to offer special status to the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir and UT of Ladakh under Article 371 of the Constitution, while indicating a move to notify domicile rules for the two newly-created UTs. Union minister of state for PMO Jitendra Singh on Saturday told TOI: “These rumours (about special provisions for UTs of J&K and Ladakh under Article 371) are part of a conspiracy by Congress and National Conference, both of which were prime beneficiaries of now scrapped Article 370, to plant stories in the media and create misgivings. There is no such move to bring back special status for J&K through the back door. I must also clarify that there is no correlation between Article 370 and Article 371, with the latter meant to only protect the unique cultural identity and traditions of a particular area or state.” While there is no review of scrapping of “special status” for J&K, sources indicated that domicile policy for the two Union territories will be notified soon. The policy will specify a domicile cut-off period for residents. A proposal on the table is to make 15 years of residency in the Union Territory a mandatory requirement for domicile status, though a final decision is yet to be taken. Domicile status would be a requirement for land ownership and rights in UTs of J&K and Ladakh. Domiciled residents shall also get preference in civil services as well as admissions to higher educational institutions. However, as per the government’s plan, domicile restrictions would not apply to industrialists and businessmen wishing to set up factories/business establishments in the UTs of J&K and Ladakh. “They will be offered land right away not only to set up industry or business unit but also for establishment of an ancillary colony,” said a government functionary. While the domicile cut-off will apply to all ordinary residents, some exceptions are being considered for civil servants and their children. “As per the pattern among many states, civil servants and their children are considered domicile of their cadre state. However, considering that all future officers will be allotted to AGMUT and not J&K cadre, we need to take a considered view before extending J&K/Ladakh domicile in case of AGMUT cadre officers,” said an official.

 Farooq Abdullah gets 3 more months under PSA | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir government on Saturday extended the Public Safety Act (PSA) on former chief minister Farooq Abdullah by three more months. A government official said that Abdullah was booked for another three months under PSA, till March 31, 2020, based on the reports from the intelligence and police departments. Farooq Abdullah, CM of J&K for four times and an MP thrice, currently represents the Srinagar constituency in the Lok Sabha and is the chairman of the National Conference. He was detained following the revocation of Article 370 and 35-A on August 5, 2019. Farooq Abdullah will continue to remain in a private house at Gupkar Road, which was declared a sub-jail, the official said. The district magistrate of Srinagar invoked the PSA on Farooq Abdullah for the first time on September 17, hours before the Supreme Court was to hear a petition by MDMK leader Vaiko, who claimed that Farooq Abdullah was detained illegally. Farooq Abdullah is one of only three former chief ministers to have been booked under PSA, the other two being his son, Omar Abdullah, and Mehbooba Mufti, the president of PDP. Both Omar and Mehbooba have been in detention in Srinagar since August 5, 2019.

 Countrywide NRC inevitable: Rajnath Singh | India News - Times of India,"BOKARO/PAKUR/RAHMAHAL: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday stressed on the inevitability of nationwide implementation of National Register of Citizenship (NRC), saying nothing can deter the government from doing so and assured that there would be “due diligence” for the exercise aimed at identifying the “swadeshi” and “videshi”. Addressing a poll rally at Rajmahal in Jharkhand, Rajnath said, “Subsequent to NRC exercise, we shall sit together and take a call about the fate of illegal migrants, who have settled here with a humane approach unlike the way they are being treated in several other countries.” In his first rally of the day at Chandankyari in Bokaro, Singh said opposition parties should understand that BJP is delivering on its promises with full public endorsement. Though touching on local issues too, Singh elaborated on the achievements of the Modi government since 2014 and said it will be “written in golden words”. He said none of the promises — citizenship law, nullification of Article 370 and even construction of Ram temple — had been imposed on the people. Citing withdrawal of special status to J&K, he said BJP had always promised that there should be “one nation, one constitution”. Singh also said that despite the opposition mocking at BJP over contruction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, the party had a firm belief in the judicial process and that the temple will be built through “legal means”. Singh says it is ironic that the opposition parties have given a political colour to the temple issue. “It’s narrow thinking that Ayodhya is a Hindu-Muslim issue... rather Ram temple is being constructed with the mandate of the Supreme Court,” he said.

Cautioning that situation in Ladakh may turn alarming, Soni on Friday demanded inclusion of the Union Territory in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution to protect its resources and rich cultural identity. ""Till now Congress has been relying on the false promise of UT to lure the voters but failed to fulfil the promise despite being in power for decades and now that the BJP has met the aspiration of the people of Ladakh by making it a UT, which Congress opposed in the Parliament, it is now trying to divide the people by creating fear in their minds,"" Dorje said reacting to her statement in the Rajya Sabha. He said, ""the fear, apprehension and disenchantment among Ladakhis as claimed by Soni is a product of her sinister mind to provoke the people of Ladakh by creating an issue in the form of sixth schedule"". Dorje said while sixth schedule permits creation of separate administrative councils for protecting the tribal rights of the identified tribes of the four north eastern states, the people of Ladakh already have two highly empowered Autonomous District Hill Councils for Leh and Kargil. ""We have full faith in these Councils which have been given additional powers lately to safeguard the interests of the people and develop the area,"" he said.

""Any law needed to safeguard their interest will be made,"" he said.

The chief minister’s call comes a month after Supreme Court ruled in favour of construction of a temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site. He said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was responsible for ushering in Ram Rajya. “In one sweep, the PM removed Article 370 in Kashmir. Today, you can go to Kashmir, Ladakh, Jammu, to the land of Ma Vaishno and Baba Amarnath and buy land. If someone has given you that right, it is PM Modi,” he said.

Commenting on the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, Yogi said India has never been biased towards anyone on the basis of caste or community, but the situation is the opposite in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. “Minorities in these countries were thrashed and thrown out, their women exploited, their properties looted. They came to India looking for refuge and the government has granted them citizenship,” he said, adding opposition parties who were opposing this bill were speaking the language of Pakistan. “They are objecting to sheltering poor and harassed people and speaking in support of illegal immigrants who are looting your rights. Should we accept Pakistan’s language? Should these parties get your votes,” he asked, adding if someone has no respect for Ram, one cannot be friends with them,” he said. Seeking votes for BJP, Yogi Adityanath said parties like Congress, RJD, CPI(ML) and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha only worked for themselves. “They instigated terrorism and Naxalism.

 No child detained in J&amp;K: SC accepts findings of HC panel | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Refuting allegations that security forces had detained several children in Jammu and Kashmir in the aftermath of the state’s special status being scrapped, the J&K high court told the Supreme Court on Friday that not a single minor was detained or lodged in jail. Complying with the apex court’s order, the Juvenile Justice Committee (JJC) of the J&K HC comprising four judges visited all jails and filed a comprehensive report in a sealed envelop in the SC. The report said the judges had verified the allegations on detention of children and found them untrue. Accepting the report, a bench of Justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai said the four judges did a great job by visiting jails and nothing was left in the petition filed by child rights activist Enakshi Ganguly as not a single case of child detention was detected by the committee. Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, appearing for the petitioner, pleaded that a copy of the report should be given to him to enable him to argue the case on its findings. But the bench turned down his plea and said he could peruse the report in court but it could not be handed over to him. The court also made it clear that it had gone through every page of the report and there was no reason to doubt the report. It asked Ahmadi whether he doubted the HC judges who filed the report. “We are satisfied with the report. If we cannot believe our judges, then there will be no remedy. It affects the image of judiciary if people doubt judges. They did a great job and personally visited jails and filed the report,” the bench said. Ahmadi responded that every HC order was challenged in the SC but it did not mean that people did not have faith in HC judges. The court was, however, not convinced and said, “The judges visited jails and they found nothing. We would have taken a serious view if they had found anything but they found nothing. If you do not believe in them, then we cannot help you.” The bench said it could not give credence to media reports cited by the petitioner, including articles in foreign newspapers, on alleged child detention in J&K. “What should we give weightage to — reports filed in Washington Post or the fact-finding report of our judges. We are satisfied that your allegations are not right and you can approach the HC in individual cases of detention. Four judges went to each jail and we are satisfied that no such incident took place,” the court said Ahmadi, however, proceeded to argue without perusing the report and contended that the court could not ignore that J&K police had admitted that 87 children were detained after August 5 and a minor could not be detained without an FIR. Referring to J&K DGP’s report in which it was admitted that children were detained, the bench said all the children were released within hours on the same day of detention. It said such measures were also necessary to ensure safety of children who could get hurt in protests. The court said the report wrongly mentioned the cases as detention and it might have been prepared by some clerk and the DGP might have blindly approved it. The court disposed of the plea and allowed the petitioner to approach the HC if she came across any case of child detention. It also directed the J&K administration to provide counselling and medical help to children who went through mental trauma. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Satisfied with HC Juvenile Justice Committee report saying no detention of minors in J&amp;K, says SC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said it is satisfied with the report of Juvenile Justice Committee of Jammu and Kashmir high court which said that no minors were detained in jails in the erstwhile state post the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370. The apex court, after perusing the Committee's report, said that four high court judges visited all the jails in J&K and they have clearly stated that no minors have been illegally detained there. A bench, headed by Justice N V Ramana, said that it would not be proper if the court does not believe its own judges. The bench made this comment when senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, appearing for petitioner Enakshi Ganguly, who has alleged that minors were detained there post abrogation of provisions of Article 370, insisted that he should be given time to respond to the committee's report. The bench granted liberty to the petitioners to approach the appropriate forum if they have any grievance over alleged detention of minors in Jammu and Kashmir. The court on November 5 asked the committee to examine afresh the allegations of detention of minors by security forces and place its report expeditiously. It observed that the J&K DGP had filed a report on September 25 in which he categorically refuted the assertions and allegations made in the media and the petition. The committee's report also contained the findings of the additional DGP denying allegations of illegal detention of juveniles in Kashmir. It had told the Supreme Court that 144 juveniles were detained in the state after the Centre abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, but 142 minors were released. The remaining two were sent to juvenile homes. Ahmadi had earlier said in court ""This is an Article 32 petition which is itself a fundamental right. This Court has heard petitions of other persons on similar issues from Kashmir. So why not this petition which affects fundamental rights of children.""

"Jharkhand assembly elections: BJP goes ballistic on national issues, minority voters focus on local affairs | Ranchi News - Times of India","RANCHI: BJP’s campaign for the state polls, which has so far focused on the achievements of the central government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has not been able to shift the attention of the electors from local issues. More than the abrogation of Article 370, Ayodhya verdict or the passage of Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament, local issues such as unemployment, failure of the state government to conduct regular JPSC examinations and the state residents’ policy played on the minds of urban electorate of Ranchi and Hatia assembly constituencies, which went to the hustings on Thursday. Imtiaz Ali, a shop-owner at Daily Market who voted at a booth in Milat Middle School in Hindpiri, said: “This government was able to provide regular water supply and electricity. But waste collection is still a problem. Drains here are not cleaned for months together.” Imtiaz’s uncle, septuagenarian Hamid Ali, said: “How does Ayodhya verdict or the decision on Kashmir affect us? Infact, the key issue is our domicile policy. My ancestors settled in Ranchi before 1932, but the residents’ policy was drafted keeping 1985 as the base year.” Muhammad Haidar, a resident of Tharkpakhna, said: “The government managed to bring down law and order flare ups. I am happy that there were far lesser incidents of communal clashes in Ranchi in five years.” Among the youth, unemployment remained the biggest issue. Satish Minz, a voter at a booth in Purulia Road’s St. Alosyisius School, said: “We are unhappy with the Raghubar Das government because he could not conduct JPSC exams on time. Moreover, we locals are not preferred in recruitments and we are still jobless. His policy of merging schools has caused trouble to students in rural areas and attendence is falling.” Another resident, Samuel Erick Ishan said, “Neither had he done well for us nor bad. His anti-conversion law was good, but he could not manage to safeguard locals’ interests. He could not bring in investments after spending huge amount on Momentum Jharkhand.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" India slams Pakistan at UN, says footprint of every major act of terrorism passes through this country | India News - Times of India","UNITED NATIONS: Hitting out at Pakistan, India has said the footprint of every major act of international terrorism passes through this country where terrorists are trained in safe havens to take innocent lives. India's remarks came after Pakistan raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and made references to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the UN General Assembly. ""Spirit of cooperation is the crux of the culture of peace. This agenda should not be misused and trivialized for political propaganda. We need to be particularly cautious when the fox is guarding the henhouse,"" First Secretary in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Paulomi Tripathi said on Thursday at the United Nations General Assembly debate on 'Culture of Peace'. Tripathi was responding to remarks made by Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the UN Munir Akram, who focussed a majority of his speech on India and its internal matters, including Jammu and Kashmir, the abrogation of Article 370, the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, the National Register of Citizens and the Supreme Court's Ayodha verdict. ""Attempts by one delegation to misuse this agenda hardly comes as a matter of surprise for those of who have witnessed their many attempts to masquerade as the champions of culture of peace. They besmirch the spirit of cooperation by spinning false narratives for political gains,"" Tripathi said. Strongly hitting back at Pakistan, Tripathi said, ""In reality footprint of every major act of international terrorism passes through this country. Terrorists are trained in their safe havens to take innocent lives. Children and youth are given guns instead of books, women are oppressed and minorities are persecuted."" She said ""virulent terror emanating from this territory” threaten to destabilise peace globally. ""Yet, with pathological obsession this delegation makes veiled baseless allegations on internal situations of other countries,"" she said. Asserting that India's position on such allegations is well known, Tripathi said it firmly rejects these baseless allegations. ""The international community has not paid attention to such deceitful propaganda for coveting territory. We are confident that this would be the case in future as well.""

" Shiv Sena slams Centre on citizenship law, violence in northeast | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Friday attacked the Centre, saying it brought the new citizenship law to show it is the sole saviour of Hindus and asked what kind of politics it is playing by inviting uncalled for pain after the move caused violence in the northeastern states. The contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) was approved by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha this week, and became an Act after President Ram Nath Kovind gave assent to it on Thursday night. The Act paves the way for granting Indian citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who have migrated after facing religious persecution in their respective country. The bill was brought only to prove that they are the sole saviour of Hindus across the world. But the government has no concrete answer to why Kashmiri Pandits have not been able to return to Kashmir despite scrapping of Article 370. ""The situation in Kashmir is still not normal, the Shiv Sena said. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party, which supported the bill in the Lok Sabha, but stayed away from voting on it in the Rajya Sabha, made the critical remarks in the editorial of its mouthpiece Saamana. The Article 370 of the Constitution, that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was revoked in August this year. Add to that, there is now violence in the north- eastern states. What kind of politics the government is playing by inviting the uncalled for pain? asked the BJP's former ally which is now heading a three-party government in Maharashtra with the Congress and the NCP. After the Shiv Sena staged a walkout before voting on the bill in the Rajya Sabha, Union Home Amit Shah sought to know the reason for the party's overnight change in position on the legislation. Countering, the Shiv Sena alleged those who forgot what was discussed in a close-door meeting should not question what led to its change in the position on the CAB. The Sena was apparently referring to the BJP allegedly not keeping its word of sharing the chief ministerial post in Maharashtra on rotational basis -- an arrangement it has been claiming was discussed in a close-door meeting of top leaders of the two parties ahead of the October 21 Assembly polls. The Shiv Sena later snapped its ties with the BJP and formed government in the state with the help of the NCP and the Congress, its ideological opponents. The Shiv Sena always took position in the interest of the country. But we were asked what happened overnight that the bill was supported in the Lok Sabha, but opposed in the Rajya Sabha...those who conveniently forgot the truth of the close-door meeting should not talk about what happened overnight, the Marathi daily said. The publication further asked the Modi government to instead focus on northeastern states to ensure the violent situation prevailing there doesnt spread elsewhere in the country.

 Congress partitioned country on religious ground under Jinnah pressure: Rajnath Singh | India News - Times of India,"LITIPARA (JHARKHAND): Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday blamed the Congress for partition of the country on religious ground under pressure of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and asserted Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was brought to protect the religious minorities persecuted in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He also hailed the BJP government for ""putting Pakistan in its place"" by striking terror camps in its territory. Singh asserted the government would soon bring National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the country. The Rajya Sabha had on Wednesday cleared the CAB after it was approved by the Lok Sabha on Monday. ""The Congress had partitioned the country on the religious ground under the pressure of (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah. ""So the CAB has been brought to protect minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan from religious persecution,"" Singh said. The minister was addressing a poll meeting in Litipara assembly constituency in the Pakur district in support of BJP candidates. ""Now the government will bring NRC soon,"" he added. Claiming that the Congress and its allies had created a record in corruption, Singh said, ""There is no stain of corruption on the Narendra Modi or the Raghubar Das governments."" He said it is the BJP government that abrogated Article 370, making Jammu and Kashmir an integral part of India, paved the way for a peaceful solution to the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute besides ""putting Pakistan in its place"" through striking terror camps in its territory. He also recounted a list of welfare and developmental schemes and projects took up by the ""double-engine"" governments (of the BJP) at the Centre and the state.

 CAB attempt to reduce Muslims into second class citizens in India: US lawmaker | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: India's Citizenship Amendment Bill is an attempt to reduce minority Muslims into second class citizens, a Muslim-American Congressman has said as the contentious bill got the clearance from both the Houses of Parliament. The contentious Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), which seeks to provide Indian citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, was passed by Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. Lok Sabha cleared the Bill on Monday. ""This move is yet another attempt to effectively reduce Muslims in India to second-class citizens,” said Congressman Andre Carson, who is one of the three Muslim members currently serving in the US Congress. Carson also raised his concern for the removal of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. ""When the Indian Prime Minister Modi announced the unilateral changes to Jammu and Kashmir's status on August 5, I expressed my grave concern about its implications for the future of Kashmir,” he said. Calling it a dangerous move that disregards international norms, Carson said that government has ignored the democratic will of the Kashmiri people, undermined the rich tradition of Indian constitutionalism and raises huge questions about the future of India. India on August 5 abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two union territories. Pakistan reacted strongly to India's decision and downgraded bilateral ties and expelled the Indian envoy. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was an internal matter. It has also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda. ""Today, we witness yet another potentially devastating move by the Prime Minister, as lawmakers enacted his draconian CAB,"" he said.

 Infiltration from Pakistan being ignored: Shiv Sena after passage of CAB | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Thursday sought to know why the government is ignoring infiltration attempts from Pakistan, even as India is preparing to provide citizenship to religiously persecuted refugees from the neighbouring country. An atmosphere is being created for granting citizenship to refugees, an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana' said, and asked whether the government will open its eyes over the issue of intrusion from Pakistan. It said the government's claim that the situation in Kashmir after the revocation of Article 370 is fine has proved wrong, as there have been ""84 infiltration attempts"" from Pakistan and ""59 terrorists"" entered India since the scrapping of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August. The Shiv Sena, which backed the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the Lok Sabha on Monday, staged a walkout ahead of voting on it in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, citing unsatisfactory response to the queries raised by the party. The bill, which seeks to provide Indian citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. The Lok Sabha passed it on Monday. ""It is surprising that despite information given by the government in Parliamentabout rising incidents of infiltration bids from across the border, there has been no discussion or debate over the issue,"" the Sena said. The government's claims on the situation in Kashmir being fine after the abrogation of Article 370 were all wrong, the Marathi daily said. ""Since August, there have been 84 infiltration attempts in which 59 terrorists entered India through various border areas. This shows that the infiltration bids have been successful,"" it claimed. ""An atmosphere is being built for granting citizenship to refugees, but will the government open its eyes to address this (issue of infiltration)?"" the Sena asked. Between 2005 and 2019, the Indian security forces arrested 42 terrorists and foiled bids of 2,253 intruders, the Uddhav Thackeray-led said, adding that in the last 14 years, the security forces killed 1,110 terrorists. Infiltration was ""at its peak"" between 2014 and 2019, the Sena stated. It said as per the annual report released by the ministry of home affairs in October this year, Pakistan made 328 infiltration bids in 2018 of which 143 were successful. In 2018, 257 terrorists were killed and 91 jawans were martyred in encounters with terrorists, the Sena said. In 2017, there were 417 infiltration bids of which 136 were successful, it said quoting the MHA figures. Besides, 119 of the total 371 infiltration attempts by terrorists were successful in 2016, 33 of 121 such bids succeeded in 2015 while 65 of 222 such attempts were successful in 2014, it added.

"Citizenship Amendment Bill: CAB set to be law as RS passes it 125-99, indefinite curfew and Army in Guwahati | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is set to become law with the Rajya Sabha passing the hotly debated and polarising legislation by 125-99 votes on Wednesday after a lengthy discussion over its provisions offering citizenship to Hindus and five other minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The numbers did not prove a challenge for the government as it notched a comfortable tally even without the support of three   Shiv Sena members who chose to boycott the vote   . The move helped the government by bringing down the House’s effective strength marginally. The bill, which will become law after getting the President’s assent, opens a path of citizenship for Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis and Jains fleeing religious persecution. Just like in the Lok Sabha, the debate saw the opposition attacking the government for a new citizenship scheme sculpted after the Hindutva idea of nationhood. The opposition said the bill discriminated against Muslims and was violative of the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution. Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, an influential body of clerics, announced its decision to challenge the new citizenship regime in court. Bihar: JD(U) votes for CAB in Rajya SabhaHome minister Amit Shah defiantly stood his ground and said a law meant to protect religious minorities from persecution in the three Muslim-majority countries could not have Muslims under its ambit. He also asserted that the legislation would clear judicial scrutiny as the proposed law, under the doctrine of “reasonable classification”, did provide for exceptions from equal application of law in certain situations. Besides the three Shiv Sena MPs who left the chamber, BJP member Anil Baluni, Independents Veerendra Kumar and Amar Singh and NCP’s Majeed Memon (all unwell) were absent. NCP’s Vandana Chavan took leave for personal reasons. According to political sources, other absentees included MPs from regional parties who were not seen in the House at the time of voting. The government’s cause was powered by the help it received from AIADMK, with 11, and BJD, with seven MPs, voting for the CAB along with YSRCP and TDP. After dilly-dallying, AGP voted for the CAB as did PMK, SDF and BDF along with Independents, including nominated members. The margin between the government and the opposition was wider in the divisions over five opposition amendments that were negated 124-98. The vote once again underlined that the Modi government has got over its Upper House jinx with significant bills like triple talaq and removal of J&K’s special status being passed with relative ease. Responding to the charge that the bill excluded Muslims, Shah said the opposition was deaf to the distress of people who had to flee their countries and were struggling to build new lives. Shah said the bill did not target one community and efforts to stoke fears among Muslims were wrong as no Indian national would lose citizenship. “Will it be secularism only if Muslims are included? As per your definition, only if Muslims come then it will be secularism,” the minister said, adding over 500 Muslims were given Indian citizenship in the past five years. With protests against CAB breaking out in Assam, Shah assured that the government was committed to preserving the language and culture of the state and a committee under Clause 6 of the Assam Accord was seized of the matter. Shah, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi did earlier at a BJP meeting, launched a scathing attack on Congress, saying remarks made by its functionaries echoed those emanating from Pakistan. The minister also declared this was a “nagrikta (citizenship) dene ka bill, na ki citizenship lene ka”. He repeated his argument that “religion-based'' Partition — for which he held Congress responsible — was the reason for the Modi government to bring the bill. “Partition on the basis of religion was the biggest mistake. The bill is meant to address the problems created by it. Congress never confronted these issues. Unlike the current Narendra Modi government, they were interested only in running the government,” Shah said. While most clarifications sought veered around the exclusion of Muslims in the bill, Shah said the community had nothing to fear and that every citizen should have faith in the government. “The opposition should not play with fire by creating fear. The citizenship of Muslims will not be affected,” he said, in remarks that seemed directed at Congress’s P Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal. The minister emphasised there was no question of creating a Muslim mukt (free) India as an MP had alleged. “The Modi government has always upheld the Constitution which can never allow anything like that,” he said. “Congress leaders have themselves said in the past that it was important to take care of Hindu and Sikh refugees. Even Gandhiji said Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan can come to India if they face persecution and that it would be the Indian government’s responsibility to take care of them by providing them employment,”' he said. The minister said Congress’s comments seemed to match those of Pakistan PM Imran Khan not just on CAB but also on Balakot air strikes, LoC surgical strikes and issues related to Article 370.

" Human rights matters won't be part of 2+2 dialogue between India, US: American diplomat | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: Issues related to human rights won't be part of the 2+2 dialogue between India and the US next week but the agenda would touch issues related to Kashmir, a top American diplomat has said. ""Human rights is not part of this 2+2 discussion that's taking place next week, although I'm confident that issues on Kashmir and the threat perceptions that India sees will obviously be a part of the agenda,"" Alice G Wells, the acting assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, said on Wednesday at a programme for commemorating the 60th Anniversary of President Eisenhower's Historic Visit to India. External affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh will arrive here next week for the second round of '2+2' dialogue with their US counterparts secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defence secretary Mark Esper on December 18. The inaugural '2+2' Indo-US dialogue was held in New Delhi in September last year. Wells said the US was closely monitoring the Kashmir situation and is looking at the Indian government to take additional steps to release detainees and restore political and economic normalcy. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation in Jammu and Kashmir where we look to the government to take additional steps to release detainees and restore political and economic normalcy that will help to ease local tensions,"" Wells said at the programme organised by the South Asia Center of the Atlantic Council and The Asia Group. ""No one doubts that India faces a tough security situation given the terror groups that operate across the border, but Kashmiri people are entitled to their full rights under the Indian Constitution, which enshrines the respect for religious freedom of all Indians,"" She said. Jammu and Kashmir has been under communication blockade and some of the leaders under detention ever since India on August 5 abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two union territories.

She also said there was concern in the US Congress about Kashmir and the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB). ""But I think it's the intensity, the level of concern within Congress over whether its Kashmir or actions on the CAB demonstrates the genuine concern here in the United States over India's trajectory,"" she said.

"Inter-college event bars plays on Babri, Article 370 | Pune News - Times of India","Pune: The organisers of Firodiya Karandak, one of the most popular inter-college performing arts competitions, have imposed a temporary ban on plays related to issues such as Article 370, J&K, Ram mandir, Babri Masjid, India-Pakistan, caste and religion. Ajinkya Kulkarni, an organiser of the event from the Socio Economic Development Trust, said this was the first time in the 46 years of the event’s history that such a ban has been implemented. The event will be held from February 1 to 24. “Banning a few topics out of a thousand is not an attack on students’ freedom of expression,” Kulkarni said. A section of students, however, is upset. Siddhant Patil, who won the two awards in the 2019 edition of the competition, said, “If this ban had been implemented during that competition, I don’t know whether I would have got my awards. My work too could have been disqualified.” continued on P xx Pune: The organisers of Firodiya Karandak, an inter-college performing arts competition, said any team performing on topics they have banned will be disqualified. One of the organisers, Ajinkya Kulkarni, said, “We have had performances based only on caste dynamics or religion for many years. We want the students to think beyond this and come up with other issues. We do not want the students, who are primarily amateur, to say anything wrong and provoke anyone.” Asked whether the students can perform on topics criticizing the government, its policies like NRC or CAB, or issues like what happened in Koregaon Bhima, Kulkarni said, “We are not against students criticizing any government or its policies. We have specified what is banned.” He said, “We have no political leanings and have never invited any politician to our event. This decision has been solely taken to ensure that the students use their creativity to focus on topics beyond caste and religion.” Firodiya Karandak will start from February 1 and the finals involving nine teams will be held on February 24. The first Firodiya Karandak was held in 1974. The uniqueness of the annual event is that everything performed on the stage is live — from songs to music pieces and dances or on-the-spot improvisations. Siddhant Patil, who graduated from Modern College of Engineering and won the second best writer and the third best play awards in the 2019 Firodiya Karandak, said, “I am against any type of ban. My play this year was about freedom of expression and how some people, especially some renowned actors, were criticized because of their thoughts.” Krishna Walke (23) from New Arts, Commerce and Science College, Ahmednagar, who won the best director award in the 2019 Purushottam Karandak, another popular inter-collegiate competition, said, “Ban on certain topics amounts to an attack on artistic freedom. Artists take inspiration from issues in society.

Intervening in the debate on the Citizenship (Amendment Bill), 2019 in the Upper House, the senior Congress leader also asked that if the entire country was happy with the proposed legislation, why protests were taking place in Assam, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Nagaland. ""Honourable home ministerji, you brought demonetisation, GST, (legislation on) tripple talaq, NRC, Article 370 (related law) and Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the same pattern.

Countering the charges, BJP member Subramanian Swamy said in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists etc., have been singled out for ill-treatment and persecution. ""As far as Ahmadiyas and Shias are concerned, they would any day prefer going to Iran, which is a Shia country, or Bahrain, where Ahmadiyas are accepted as Muslims ... so they cannot come into this category..

 Shiv Sena opposes Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Rajya Sabha | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Shiv Sena, which voted in favour of the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Lok Sabha, opposed it in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, saying the draft law should have been debated on the basis of ""humanity not religion"". The Sena does not need to prove how ""staunch Hindu"" and ""patriotic"" the party is, Sanjay Raut said while participating in a debate on the Bill in the Upper House. ""We should discuss this Bill based on humanity not on religion. There is a difference between intruders and refugees,"" said Raut, whose party is a former ally of the BJP. The Sena recently formed government in Maharashtra along with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The Bill, which is being debated in Rajya Sabha, seeks to grant Indian citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan escaping religious persecution there. Throwing intruders out of the country has been a commitment of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and it was promised during election rallies also, Raut said. He said there should not be any ""vote-bank politics"" while giving citizenship to non-Muslim minorities under the Bill and added that there will be ""some balance"" if voting rights are not given to them for 25 years. The Sena member also attacked some MPs who said on Tuesday that those opposing the Bill were ""traitors"" and ""speaking the language of Pakistan"". ""We don't need any certificate to prove how patriotic we are and how staunch Hindu we are. We are headmaster in a school that you study.

 Citizenship Amendment Bill a slap on face of Parliament: Chidambaram | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday termed the Citizenship Amendment Bill a slap on the face of Parliament and said the government is ""ramming"" through with it in order to advance its Hindutva agenda. Participating in a debate on the bill in the Rajya Sabha, he charged the government with ""wrecking and demolishing"" the Constitution through it and expressed confidence that the judiciary would strike down the law. Terming the bill ""unconstitutional and insidious"", the senior Congress leader asked why Sri Lankan Hindus and Bhutanese Christians were excluded, saying this ""exclusionary, inclusionary hyphenation is beyond common sense and logic"". ""This (bill) is a slap on the face of Parliament. Parliamentarians are being asked to do something unconstitutional and then the baby is passed on to the judiciary and in the judiciary, lawyers and judges will decide what you have done is constitutional or not. Knowing this is unconstitutional, I am afraid this government is ramming through (with) this bill in order to advance its Hindutva agenda,"" he said. ""This is a sad day. Thankfully they are not amending the Constitution, they are only making a law. I am absolutely confident, I am absolutely clear in my mind, this law will be struck down,"" he added. He claimed that a small part of the Constitution is sought to be wrecked and demolished by this ""insidious"" bill, hoping the judiciary would strike it down and save India and the idea of India. The bill seeks to provide Indian citizenship to non-Muslim refugees coming from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan after facing religious persecution there. He sought to know on what basis the six religious groups were identified and others like Ahmadiyas, Hazaras and Rohingyas left out. Chidamabaram asked why the bill included only those who faced religious persecution and not persecution based on political reasons, on linguistic grounds, or by unleashing religious war against them. Claiming that arbitrariness was writ large on the face of the bill, he asked whether or not it violated the three fundamental principles of Article 14 of the Constitution. He dared the government to lay the opinion of the law department and to invite the attorney general to the Upper House to answer all these questions. Terming the Citizenship Amendment Bill a ""patently unconstitutional law"", he said the government was pushing the issue to the lap of the judges. Ram Chandra Prasad Singh (JDU) supported the bill and sought to provide an assurance that the party would not be left behind in opposing any discrimination on the basis of religion in the country. K Keshava Rao (TRS) said the bill challenged the very idea of India and it negated every idea of justice. ""We oppose this bill because it is marginalising Muslims, because it is anti-Muslim,"" Rao said. T K Rangarajan of the CPI(M) termed it ""anti- constitutional and illegal"" and said his party opposed the bill, asking why other communities like Ahmadiyas, Rohingyas and Sri Lankan Tamils were excluded from its ambit. Tiruchi Siva of the DMK said he strongly opposed the bill and it would not stand the scrutiny of the Supreme Court. He described it as ""extremely polarising"" and said a sense of apprehension had cropped up in Muslims across the country. Swapan Dasgupta (nominated) said the bill had followed international laws. Biswajit Daimary (BPF) supported the bill, while Birendra Prasad Baishya (AGP) claimed that the Assamese people were in constant fear and the state could not take the burden of extra people. He demanded that Inner Line Permit System should be implemented in Assam. Supporting the bill, K J Alphons (BJP) raised the issue of plight of Christians in Pakistan and said the government abrogated provisions of Article 370 because it was a constitutional anomaly. Vijila Sathyananth (AIADMK) said her party supported the bill but pleaded to Home Minister Amit Shah seeking inclusion of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in the bill's ambit.

 SC’s 5-judge bench starts Article 370 hearing | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court’s five-judge Constitution bench on Tuesday commenced hearing on a clutch of petitions challenging the Centre’s decision to scrap special status given to Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two UTs with the petitioners contending that the decision was illegal and unconstitutional. Initiating the arguments, senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for bureaucrat-turned-activist Shah Faesal and others, told a bench of Justices N V Ramana, S K Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant that constitutionally prescribed procedures were not followed under which amendment in Article 370 could be done only on the recommendation of the state. He said the Centre brought the amendment under the “temporary cover” of the President’s rule and that the temporary power cannot be used to bring about irreversible change in the federal relationship between the state and the Union. He alleged that opinion of people of Jammu and Kashmir was not taken and the decision was imposed on them by the Centre in haste and presumption of constitutionality could not be attached to such process. “A presidential notification can be issued only if the proposal for the cessation of Article 370 emanates from the state’s Constituent Assembly (or its successor in law, if any). J&K constituent assembly does not exist at the current time and thus could not have made a recommendation to that effect. Furthermore, no recommendation was made by any legislative body in exercise of its constituent power in J&K that Article 370 shall cease to have effect,” the senior advocate said. He said the power of the President and Parliament during proclamation under Article 356 is temporary and restorative in nature and the decisions taken during the period of President rule could be reversed by state legislature. “The President does not acquire the constituent powers of the government of J&K under Article 370(I)(d), to give concurrence to a modification of the Constitution as applied to the state. Hence such power to give concurrence cannot be exercised by the governor either, as he is merely a delegate of the President in the state, under President’s Rule,” he said. He said even the J&K assembly does not have power to alter the arrangement between the Centre and J&K as prescribed under Article 370 and the power is solely vested in the Constituent Assembly. “Likewise, Parliament under Article 356 does not acquire the constituent power of the legislative assembly of the state under Article 370(3) to recommend a presidential notification. Consequently, the resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament ... purportedly in exercise of powers that vest in the “legislative assembly” of the state of J&Kashmir are invalid in the eyes of law,” he said. At the outset, it was brought to the court’s notice that it has to take a call on referring the petitions to a larger bench as there are differences of opinion in two verdicts delivered by five-judge Constitution benches earlier. The court said it was aware about the earlier verdict and it may consider referring the case to larger bench at a later stage. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" Situation in Kashmir normal, Congress concerned more about 'political activity' than people: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday reiterated that the situation in Kashmir valley is completely ""normal"" and hit out at Congress saying that the party is more concerned about the ""political activity"" in the region than the people there. ""The situation in Kashmir valley is completely normal. I can't make Congress' condition normal, because they had predicted bloodshed after the abrogation of Article 370. Nothing of that sort happened, not one bullet was fired and no one died due to it,"" Shah said in Lok Sabha today. ""99.5% of students took examination there, but for Adhir Ranjan ji this is not normalcy, 7 lakh people availed OPD services in Srinagar, curfew and section 144 removed from everywhere. But for Adhir ji the only parameter for normalcy is political activity. What about local body polls that were held? There was 95% voting in Tehsil-Panchayat elections (Block Development Council) polls without any violence. This is also political,"" he added. The home minister assured that the lower house that political leaders, who are currently in jail, will be released only by the local administration and the government will not interfere in their decision. ""We don't want to keep them even a day extra in jail when administration thinks its right time, political leaders will be released. They are in jail for 5-6 months only. Farooq Abdullah's father was kept in jail for 11 years by Congress and Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister. But we don't want to follow them. It will be the decision of local administration to release them based on the situation at ground level and we will not interfere. This is the culture of Congress to interfere, not ours,"" Shah said. ""Everybody including me is worrying about leaders in jail. But we should worry more about people in Kashmir. Had Congress asked questions keeping people in mind, then they would have thought that Congress is concerned about them and not just political activity there,"" he said. Home minister Shah and Leader of Congress party in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury engaged in heated arguments with the former alleging interruption by opposition during his speech. The Congress leader said that his party leaders are also in custody and sought details people who are arrested in Jammu and Kashmir. In August, the government abrogated Article 370 that gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the region into two union territories- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

" JD(U) divided over CAB, Nitish draws opposition flak | India News - Times of India","PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U), a BJP ally, on Tuesday appeared divided on supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, with two top party functionaries calling the legislation ""discriminatory and unconstitutional"". Party vice-president Prashant Kishor and general secretary Pavan K Varma voiced disappointment over the JD(U) backing the Bill in the Lok Sabha, and urged Kumar to ""reconsider"" the stand when the legislation is debated in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the BJP expressed gratitude to the alliance partner, which had opposed key legislations like the Triple Talaq bill and the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganization) Bill in the recent past. However, the JD(U) came under opposition fire for supporting the CAB in Parliament. ""I urge Shri Nitish Kumar to reconsider support to the #CAB in the Rajya Sabha. The Bill is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and against the unity and harmony of the country, apart from being against the secular principles of the JDU. . Gandhiji would have strongly disapproved it,"" Varma, also the party's national spokesman, tweeted. He later told NDTV that he might broach the issue with the Bihar chief minister, who is also the national president, though that would remain between him and me. When asked if the party's stand in the Lok Sabha stemmed from political necessity as the state will have assembly elections next year, Varma said despite being a constituent of the BJP-led NDA the party has taken contrarian stand on several sensitive issues like Article 370 and instant triple talaq. The CAB, he said, is not in consonance with JD(U)'s constitution, which cannot be held hostage to political concerns. Noting that Nitish Kumar had walked in and out of the NDA in the past, he pointed out that while the JD(U)-BJP coalition has given a ""stable and good"" government in Bihar, the two parties were contesting Jharkhand assembly polls separately. ""The party has freedom to formulate its views on issues,"" he said. When asked whether he will ask Kumar to shift the party's stand in the Rajya Sabha where the Bill will be tabled on Wednesday, Varma said, ""I will be in touch with my leader but that is between me and the party."" Earlier, on Monday night, while the Bill was being put to vote in the Lok Sabha, Kishor had tweeted disappointed to see JDU supporting #CAG that discriminates right of citizenship on the basis of religion. It's incongruous with the party's constitution that carries the word secular thrice on the very first page and the leadership that is supposedly guided by Gandhian ideals. Bihar BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand came out with a cryptic tweet on Tuesday, saying some individuals are keen to establish themselves either as an institution or beyond the organizational framework. They also want their leader to follow them and move according to their dictates. The one who cant shed differences for the sake of ones country is worthless. In another tweet, in Hindi, he thanked parties which supported the Bill. Another JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad sought to defuse the controversy, saying ""Our party is democratic hence there is not a gag order. Some senior leaders have expressed their personal views. The party took its official stand after factoring in that the persecuted minorities from the adjoining countries should get help from India. ""Moreover, the assumption that this legislation discriminates against Muslims is unfounded. Even if a Muslim in countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan or Bangladesh needs help, there has been a system in place to grant political asylum. And that system will not go away with the (passage of) the Bill,"" he added. However, the Congress fumed at the ""equivocation"" by the JD(U) and warned it of electoral implications given Kumar's popularity among the state's Muslims despite old ties with the BJP. ""I have been in touch with many Muslims within the JD (U) who are deeply embarrassed by the flip-flop. Nitish Kumar should come out and state himself which is the real face of JD(U) - the one represented by Varma and Kishor or the one we saw in Parliament,"" BPCC working president Kaukab Qadri told PTI. Qadri accused Kumar of ""capitulating before those whose guiding forces have been Nathuram Godse and Savarkar for the sake of holding on to power"". ""Nitish Kumar's talk of socialism and Gandhianism is a farce. He has often wondered why the Congress has never chosen the JD(U) to align with instead of the RJD. In his own inconsistency lies the answer,"" he said. Qadri said nobody knew what Kumar actually believed in, and claimed that the JD(U) president will lose whatever goodwill he enjoyed among the state's Muslims. The RJD, meanwhile, launched a blistering attack on its official Twitter handle, calling Kishor ""a BJP agent"" who was inducted by Kumar under instructions of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. The RJD was alluding to the claim made by the Bihar chief minister in a TV interview some months ago that the BJP national president had asked him to make the former poll strategist an active member of the JD(U). Akhtarul Iman, state president of Asaduddin Owaisis AIMIM, which recently made its maiden entry into the Bihar assembly winning Kishanganj seat in a bypoll, said ""The development has exposed the communalist face of Nitish Kumar, who has been pretending to be secular to garner Muslim votes."" He urged all Muslim MLAs and MPs of the JD(U) to stand in solidarity with the ""sentiment prevailing within the community"" and tender their resignation.

The hearing before a 5-judge Constitution bench, headed by Justice N V Ramana, started with senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faesal and other petitioners, advancing his arguments. Ramachandran told the bench, also comprising justices S K Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant, about the broad contours of what he would argue in the case. He raised the point as to whether by using the ""temporary cover"" of President's rule, an ""irreversible change in a federal relationship between a state of the Union and the Union"" could be brought in. Ramachandran said he would also argue on whether it could have been done without the participation of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, through their elected representatives, since the erstwhile state was split into two Union Territories. ""The second major head will be with particular reference to Jammu and Kashmir that is when Article 370 prescribes within itself the mechanism for alteration in that relationship, whether that mechanism can be disobeyed while making this irreversible change,"" he said.

 Indian-American lawmaker introduces Congressional resolution on Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has introduced a Congressional resolution on Kashmir urging India to end as swiftly as possible restrictions on communications and preserve religious freedom for all residents. The resolution, introduced in the House of Representatives after several weeks of efforts by Jayapal, has only one co-sponsor - Republican Congressman Steve Watkins from Kansas. It's a simple resolution, which cannot be voted in the other chamber, Senate, and does not have the force of law. Ahead of the introduction of the resolution, Indian-Americans from across the US urged her in various settings against it. Her office is believed to have received more than 25,000 emails from Indian-Americans in addition to in-person meetings by several representations of Indian-Americans. Indian-Americans held peaceful demonstrations outside her office against her move to table the resolution on Kashmir. The resolution urges India to lift the remaining restrictions on communication and to restore internet access across all of Jammu and Kashmir as swiftly as possible. While it recognises the dire security challenges faced by India in Jammu and Kashmir and the continuing threat of state-supported cross-border terrorism, the resolution urges India to refrain from the use of threats and excessive force against detained people and peaceful protesters. It requests India to ""swiftly release arbitrarily detained people"" and ""refrain from conditioning"" the release of detained people on their willingness to sign bonds prohibiting any political activities and speeches. The resolution claims that there is photographic evidence indicating that detained people have been required to sign surety bonds forbidding them from making statements or participating in political activities as a condition of their release. India has denied these allegations. India maintains that the abrogation of Article 370 was its internal matter.

 BJP accuses P Chidambaram of violating bail condition | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Thursday accused Congress leader P Chidambaram of violating bail conditions by claiming to have a very clear record as a minister, and said the case against him was essentially about corruption he was allegedly involved in as the finance minister. Union minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters that the claim of Chidambaram, who was released on bail on Wednesday, amounted to ""self-certification"". The Supreme Court had asked the Congress leader not to speak about the case against him while ordering his release on bail. ""P Chidambaram has violated the bail condition on the very first day after his release.... What he said is in violation of this condition,"" the BJP leader said. A Supreme Court bench, while granting bail to Chidambaram, asked him not to make any public comment in connection with the case. Addressing a press conference at the Congress headquarters, the former finance minister had said earlier, ""In the last 106 days, I was strong in spirit and I have become stronger because...my record as minister and my conscience are absolutely clear."" Taking a jibe at the opposition leader over his attack on the Modi government on a host of issues, Javadekar said he has got to speak to the media after so many days and that is why he was taking out his anger on every subject. Some Congress leaders are in jail, some have just got out of jail and some are on bail, he said, adding that the opposition party has become desperate. It is not that they were in jail for their role in ""freedom movement"" but due to criminal charges against them, he said. Hitting back at Chidambaram over his criticism of the government that it had denied basic freedom to people in Kashmir since Article 370 was nullified in August, the Union minister said all media outlets have been functioning in the Valley. ""Kashmir is now on path to progress,"" Javadekar said. At the beginning of his press conference, Chidambaram had said his first thoughts upon his release were with the Kashmiri people who ""have been denied their basic freedoms since August 4, 2019."" Invoking the Emergency imposed by the Congress government in 1975, Javadekar said the then Indira Gandhi government had clamped down on the media while the Modi government has shared all information related to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir with Parliament. The government has allowed journalists from India and abroad to travel to Kashmir where, he added, incidents of stone-pelting have come down by more than half. Referring to Chidambaram's attack on the government over the issue of economic slowdown, he said low inflation and high growth in economy have been the highlights of the Modi dispensation since 2014 while the opposite was true for the preceding Congress-led UPA regime.

"Modi in Jamshedpur: PM Modi attacks JMM-Congress alliance, says it follows politics of deception | India News - Times of India","JAMSHEDPUR/KHUNTI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a two-pronged attack on the Congress, accusing it of procrastinating resolution of national issues like Article 370 and the Ayodhya dispute, and presiding over ""corrupt and unstable"" governments in Jharkhand. Stumping for BJP nominees for the Jharkhand assembly polls, Modi harped on the repeal of provisions of Article 370 that gave the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir its special status, and the Ayodhya tangle - themes that have underpinned both his and party chief Amit Shah's campaign rallies in the state. ""The talk of Article 370 was on since Independence. The Constitution said the article was a temporary provision. Article 370 is now gone from Jammu and Kashmir. ""Tell me whether the entire country has stood behind us on the issue or not. Tell me the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh have stood behind us on this or not. When things are done with good intentions, you have the blessings of the whole country,"" Modi told an election rally in Jamshedpur. Amid a roaring applause by the crowd, the prime minister spoke about the Ayodhya tangle. ""Did Ram Janmabhoomi (dispute) happen after we came to power? Was it not the Congress party that obstructed a resolution? Was it not done for vote bank politics?"" he asked an indulgent audience that shouted ""yes"" in emphatic endorsement. While speaking about the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, Modi sought to strike a chord with the vast tribal electorate in the state when he talked of Lord Ram's links with forest dwellers. ""Lord Ram left Ayodhya as a prince but returned as 'Maryada Purushottam' 14 years later as he spent time with Adivasis in forests, imbibed their values,"" he said. The prime minister said while the Congress only got things tangled up ""uljhaana"", it was left to the BJP to ""disentangle"" (suljhaana) difficult situations. He launched a blistering attack on the opposition JMM-Congress alliance in Jharkhand, alleging it followed the politics of ""deception"" while the BJP believed in serving people. Modi alleged rampant corruption and political instability were the hallmarks of the governments helmed by the JMM-Congress alliance. ""Even the chief minister's chair was up for sale. Until five years ago, Jharkhand used to be in news for political instability. It saw 10 chief ministers in 15 years before the BJP government led by Raghubar Das came and lasted a full term. Before him CMs got changed faster than the weather,"" he said. Modi cited his 13-year stint as the Gujarat chief minister as an example of what a stable government can achieve. ""Gujarat kahan se kahan pahunch gaya (see how Gujarat progressed),"" he said. He said the first phase of polling on November 30 had clearly shown that the ""backbone of naxalism has been broken"". The prime minister told the rally in Khunti that heavy polling proved people's faith in democracy and nation-building in an environment conducive for development. Modi asked voters to be wary of the opposition alliance as it was only interested in the ""loot of Jharkhand's resources"". At the rally in the steel city of Jamshedpur, Modi spoke extensively about steps taken by his government for improving the condition of labour force and industrial development. He said his government wanted to develop Jharkhand as a silk and textile hub. Jamshedpur, he said, had played a significant role in catapulting India to the position of second largest steel manufacturer in the world. ""My government has great concern for labourers, particularly those in the unorganised sector,"" he said, adding the 'Shram Yogi Mandhan Yojana', the pension scheme for labourers, will benefit a large number of people working in unorganised sector.

" 'Gandhi majboori of Godse lovers, mazbooti for others' | India News - Times of India","The furore over BJP MP Pragya Thakur's remarks on Nathuram Godse in Parliament reached Times LitFest Delhi 2019 too. On the first day of the two-day literature festival at the India Habitat Centre, her controversial remarks declaring Godse to be a patriot were alluded to and objected to in at least two high-voltage sessions, one of which was on the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi in the 150th year of his birth. ""We are talking about Gandhi in the same week when an MP referred to Godse as the 'real patriot'. She had to apologise, not under any moral pressure but purely political pressure,"" said historian professor Purushottam Agrawal, during the session 'Gandhi @150: The Father lives on', which also had historian Pushpesh Pant and Dr A Annamalai of National Gandhi Museum as speakers. Agrawal said, ""When I was growing up, there was a popular saying, 'Majboori ka naam Mahatma Gandhi'. But I continue to interact with Gandhian thought with the belief that 'mazbooti ka naam hai Mahatma Gandhi'. But the circumstances in the last few years suggest that for certain kind of people, Gandhi is their 'majboori'. They believe Godse was a great man who did a patriotic act, and they say this in informal circles. But they can't commit themselves to such a position formally. So, for them, Gandhi is 'majboori'. For others, Gandhi is mazbooti: of human will, spirit, and commitment."" Pant said in his opening remarks that Gandhi needs to be seen as an integrated whole due to his prolific writings and thoughts on almost every subject affecting national and international life. ""Each generation has to rediscover Gandhi,"" Pant said, quoting from historian Ramachandra Guha's biography of Gandhi. ""For Gandhi, no religion was greater than truth and compassion. And he had no prescription for India."" Agrawal agreed with him and said that while accepting Gandhi as an integrated whole, it is important to remember that Gandhi had the generosity and intellectual competence to respect and understand the essence of disagreement. ""And therefore, in 1942, he could emphatically say that not Rajaji, not Sardar Patel, but only Jawahar will be my heir. Jawaharlal Nehru never hid his disagreements with Gandhi; they publicly discussed it. In his autobiography written in 1935, Nehru categorically questions many of Gandhi's ideas but also knows that nothing works after all before Mahatma the magician. And Gandhi knew that Nehru's disagreements are not coming from some kind of opportunism but from deep, moral questioning. Gandhi loved that,"" Agrawal said. Dr Annamalai underlined how Gandhi was a rational and scientific man. ""In 1937, he had an ECG of his heart done in Calcutta. From 1935, he was regularly getting his urine and blood checked. He would carry his instruments to check blood pressure. He used a microscope. He used a stethoscope. He was trained in nursing and had midwifed the birth of his son, Devdas Gandhi. He also served in the Indian ambulance corps during the Boer War. Gandhi visited the topmost scientific institutions in India and met the topmost scientists. So, he had a very scientific mind. He wasn't against science and technology, as is often the perception. He believed simple technology would empower people. His spinning wheel was essentially a simple technology to empower,"" said Dr Annamalai, busting several popular myths. Agrawal said another understudied but very important aspect of Gandhi was his rejection of 'sacred violence'. ""We all hate violence if it is committed on us by others. But we love and rationalise violence when it is perpetrated by us on others. In every religious and non-religious tradition of the world, that is Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, nationalism and communism, you find a variant of the saying, 'Vaidiki hinsa hinsa na bhavati', which means sacred violence is no violence at all. Gandhi was the first person in the history of human philosophy to interrogate and challenge the concept of sacred violence. He rejected all kinds of violence and their rationalisations. But he was not a foolhardy romantic to think that violence can be wished away. His originality lay in the fact that he knew that violence was a fact of life, but it must not be the value of life."" To questions from the audience about Article 370, Kashmir and the Constitution, the panelists pointed out that the Father of the Nation was a very democratic man. ""Even on Kashmir, he had said, 'Go to the people and ask them what they want. If people decide on something, give it to them',"" said Dr Annamalai. To another question on the future existence of Gandhi amid a general mood developing in India that's inimical to the study of history and the social sciences, Agrawal said only ""a shortsighted society hell-bent on committing suicide"" can ignore the social sciences.

 Centre determined to implement all Central Acts in J&amp;K and Ladakh: Jitendra Singh | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: The ""prophets of doom"" predicting ""volcanos"" in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 have ""fallen silent"" and the Centre is committed to implement all central laws in the Union territories of J&K and Ladakh, Union minister Jitendra Singh said on Saturday. Urging people to cooperate with the government in the implementation of the Central laws, Singh sought to assure them that all central laws are ""citizen friendly"" and meant to ""benefit the last man in the queue"" and ""liberate the lower strata of society from the exploitation by the vested interests"". ""Let each one of us understand and keep reminding ourselves and those around us that the Article 370 is gone and gone forever. It is not going to come back. Even the prophets of doom who were talking of eruption of volcanos and occurrence of earthquakes have fallen silent,"" Singh said inaugurating a two-day regional conference here. The conference 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' with focus on 'jal shakti' and disaster management was organised by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances in collaboration with the governments of Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Singh, who also released a special issue of e-magazine, 'Minimum Government Maximum Governance' based on successful innovations in the governance in J&K and Ladakh, said Article 370 has ""gone as a whole and not in pieces"". ""With the abrogation of Article 370 and the creation of the two UTs, it is the resolve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah that we have to implement all central acts over here. ""There are 854 Central acts which need to be implemented here. We just have less than 200 of them. We have to make up for all the lapses of the last seven decades because these are all citizen-friendly acts which are meant to reach the last man in the queue and to liberate the lowest strata of the society from the exploitation at the hands of the vested interests,"" the minister of state in the Prime Minister's office said. He said some laws, like the Prevention of Corruption Act, have already been implemented to facilitate the settlement of corruption cases within two years and the rest are in the pipeline. Singh said the Centre has taken a very important responsibility at hand and ""we are going to take it forward. The Lt Governor has a mandate to do so. These acts are being notified one after the other. Rest assured it is going to happen sooner than later."" ""As patriotic, right thinking and responsible citizens, it is our responsibility to cooperate with the government and the lieutenant governor and his administration.

Referring to the demands raised by different sections including the lawyers who are on indefinite strike since November 1 against the government's decision to divest judicial courts of its powers to register various documents by creating a new department, he said, ""We are not going to succumb because there will be no end to it if one demand is met. ""You have a strange kind of fringe elements, representing vested interests and raising voices. Let us be very clear about it, we have to swallow the bitter pill,"" Singh said. ""We should feel happy that Article 370 was abrogated after 70 years of struggle. This government has gone beyond the imagination of the masses who had actually buried these aspirations,"" said Singh. Referring to the Fundamental Right to Free Education under Article 21A of the Constitution and a slew of other central laws like the Dowry Act, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences, the Minimum Wages Act, the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents Act, vigilance law, the Central Administrative Tribunal, the Information commission Act, Singh said, ""We do not have the majority in the Rajya Sabha. I am personally sitting with the Opposition to convince them to get these amendments through."" ""We will have to sacrifice our petty interests for the bigger purpose which the prime minister has created for us... we should be celebrating the new set up that has happened after October 31 and feel proud that we are the part of this and we have contributed to it,"" he said. The government of India allocated Rs 8,227 per citizen in the country last fiscal but J&K citizens were allocated Rs 27,358, which was nearly four times the average allocation for the citizens in the rest of the country, said Singh, adding ""but we still are weeping"".

 Internet services across all platforms continue to remain suspended in Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Internet services across all platforms continued to remain suspended in Kashmir since August 5 even as there was considerable improvement in the situation, officials said on Saturday. Internet services continued to remain barred in the entire valley except for few government offices and business establishments, the officials said. They said there is no word from the authorities on the restoration of the services so far, even as demands, especially from journalist community, have grown for the resumption of the services. The media-persons have been demanding the restoration of at least BSNL's Broadband services to discharge their professional duties. The authorities snapped all communication lines – landline telephone and mobile phone services and internet across all platforms -- on August 5, hours before the Centre announced its decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and to bifurcate the erstwhile state into two Union territories. Most of the top-level and second-rung separatist politicians have been taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders including two former chief ministers -- Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti -- have been either detained or placed under house arrest. While landline telephones were gradually restored first, post-paid mobile services were resumed later. However, pre-paid mobile and internet services are yet to be resumed. The officials said there are apprehensions that vested interests might misuse the internet services to create law and order situation in the valley and a decision to restore the facilities would be taken at an appropriate time after assessing the situation. Meanwhile, shops and business establishments remained open till noon in most parts of Kashmir valley and in some areas in the civil lines till late afternoon, on Saturday, the officials said. They said most modes of public transport were plying in the valley. While there was a semblance of normalcy in the Kashmir valley over the past few weeks after over three months of protest shutdown over the abrogation of Article 370, the fresh shutdown started on Wednesday last week as threatening posters warning shopkeepers and public transport operators appeared at some places in the city here and elsewhere.

" Kashmiri students can’t pay fees, hit with fines | India News - Times of India","DEHRADUN: Many Kashmiri students studying in Dehradun and parts of Punjab have alleged that their colleges charged them late fee and fined them for short attendance as they were not able to manage their academic schedule due to the clampdown in the Valley after Article 370 was revoked. The students said they were being charged ""random amounts ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 12,000"" for failing to submit their fee on time. The management of the colleges told TOI that ""late fee is a norm that has always been in place and Kashmiri students are not specifically being targeted"". However, students said that even when they had approached the administration of their institutions citing their concerns, they were asked to ""either pay the fine or forget sitting in the exams"". Uttarakhand cabinet minister Madan Kaushik told TOI that ""the matter of harassment of Kashmiri students is a sensitive one and the Uttarakhand government will ensure that these students get all possible help and support"". Late on Friday evening, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh tweeted: ""Will not allow this to happen in my state. It was not the fault of the students and I will ensure that they do not suffer on account of the delay in payment of fee or attendance shortage resulting from the clampdown in Kashmir, which was never in their control."" Times ViewCollege administrations had an opportunity to display empathy for the plight of Kashmiri students, who were unable to pay their fees owing to circumstances completely beyond their control. Instead, they chose to throw the rulebook at these students, displaying a complete lack of compassion, and making an already stressful situation for these students even more fraught. One can only hope that better sense prevails and the 'late fee' and 'attendance' rules are eased so that the students can continue their studies without any problems. There is a time to apply rules strictly, and a time to show humanity. This scenario very definitely calls for the latter.Irfan Mohammed, a student of B Tech at Maya College in Dehradun, told TOI that his late fee fine was Rs 8,000 till last week, and has been increased to Rs 12,000 by the college administration this week. ""My father is a driver in Kupwara. He hasn't earned a penny since the clampdown as there is no work for him in the valley because the situation is still not normal. I am ashamed of asking money from my parents and now if I have to pay Rs 12,000, I don't know where I will get the money from."" He added that he had approached the college administration for some rebate but was asked to either pay the fine or forgo the exams. Nasir Khuehami, spokesperson of the Jammu and Kashmir Students Association, claimed that like Irfan, there are over 300 Kashmiri students in Dehradun who are being asked to pay late fees and short attendance fines by the colleges. ""Most of the students in Dehradun are from Uttaranchal College, Sai Institute and Maya College to name a few. The situation is almost the same in Punjab from where the J&K Students Association has received over a thousand complaints of late fee fines imposed on Kashmiri students,"" Khuehami alleged. Khuehami added that it was impossible for students to pay the fee on time considering that connectivity was snapped in the valley and everything had come to a standstill for many weeks. ""We have made a fervent appeal to the college administrations to waive the fine and to conduct extra classes so that all topics are covered, but they are least bothered,"" Khuehami said, adding that the association has also urged the governments of Uttarakhand and Punjab to take action against colleges that are ""harassing students in this manner."" GDS Warne, managing director of Uttaranchal (PG) College in Dehradun, said that late fee and short attendance fine had been levied on students as per norms of the institution without any bias. ""We have fined 27 students for depositing late fee and short attendance, among which only six are Kashmiris. So, we aren't targeting them specifically. But yes, if the students have some genuine problems and approach us regarding it, we will surely waive the fine,"" he added. Ashutosh Badola, HR head of Maya College, and Himanshu Kumar from Sai Institute denied that students of their respective institutions had ever approached them regarding this issue. Kunal Kant, admission associate from Desh Bhagat University in Chandigarh, said that ""no student hailing from Kashmir was charged late fee"".

Revealing that he himself had come up the hard way-—his father passed away when he was only two and a half years old—Malik said the poor, the unemployed, armymen and farmers were in need of attention. “A lot of things are happening in India that are not being shown (in films). You sit here and make speeches that we feel this and that for our Army. There are people who live in 14-storeyed houses. Their dogs live on one floor, their drivers on another, but they do not give a paisa for armymen,” he said. Attack super-rich through film: MalikThe day the armymen’s corpses comes home, the entire district’s officials go there. After the funeral, no one goes to inquire about the widow and her child. These people with 14-storeyed houses do not give a paisa in charity for their education,” Malik said. He asked filmmakers to “attack” the super-rich through their films. “Now there are no landlords for you to attack who are carrying out atrocities. I am telling you about a new breed. Attack these people in your films. Help youth, help farmers. With this, society will surely change. Not even books can have the kind of impact films can have. It is a small prayer that you should strip this truth naked. Create a sense of disgust in the minds of people for persons like these,” Malik said.

Governor Satya Pal Malik: Not a single casualty in Kashmir because of people’s attitude | Goa News - Times of India,"PANAJI: Goa governor Satya Pal Malik on Thursday narrated his experiences in Jammu & Kashmir, where he was posted as governor until recently. “I do not want to say it is because of us, but it is because of the attitude of the people today that there is not even one casualty in Kashmir. You will be surprised if I tell you that I was warned that after the abrogation of Article 370, there could be a revolt by the Kashmir police. But I am proud to say that even on the eve of Eid, not a single Kashmir police personnel asked for leave. They celebrated Eid on duty,” Malik said. He described the difficult conditions in Kashmir as a hangover and said he was yet to settle into his new role. “Every night when I went to sleep, I could think of the dialogue from the film ‘Pakeezah’. ‘Aaj ki raat baechenge to saver dekhenge’ (If I survive this night, then I will able to able to see a new day). Under me, the first panchayat elections were held after 17 years. All parties boycotted it. Hurriyat warned us. But in the end, not even a bird was killed. It was a historic event in Kashmir. In the Burhan Wani incident, 110 died. But after the Abrogation of Article 370, the Indian forces didn’t have to fire even one bullet. Bureaucrats used to say 1,000 people will be killed. But after the abrogation, I went to the market and I was invited home for tea by a boy. The people’s behaviour changed overnight,” Malik said.

 Keep Manipur out of CAB purview: BJP MP to Centre | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Anticipating that the government may move the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) in Parliament before the winter session gets over on December 13, BJP member Rajkumar Ranjan Singh, who represents Inner Manipur constituency in Lok Sabha, has urged the Centre to exclude the state from the legislation's purview. During Zero Hour in the lower House, Singh said, ""I would like to draw the attention of the Government of India to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill that is going to be placed in this winter session... a few days back, it was brought out in media that an exemption from this citizenship law will be given only to those states where the inner line permit system is enforced. That means this law will not be applied in the states of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. Other northeastern states like Manipur shall come under the purview of this new citizenship law."" Concerned that there is a possibility of non-Manipuri people being included as citizens rather than locals if the legislation is implemented, Singh said, ""People are apprehensive. They believe if this new law is enacted, there will be huge influx of migrants."" Meanwhile, opposition parties urged Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to ensure there are ""no surprises"" on account of introduction of any legislation. The reference was to the issue of a bill on Article 370 that was introduced in the upper House by home minister Amit Shah without any prior notice.

 Terror incidents in J&amp;K have come down to almost nil after abrogation of 370: Rajnath | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday asserted in Lok Sabha that after abrogation of provisions of Article 370, terror incidents in Jammu and Kashmir have come down to almost nil. He also said the Army, paramilitary forces and the Jammu and Kashmir Police have been coordinating to fight terrorism in the state. ""Terror incidents have been taking place in Jammu and Kashmir for the last 30-35 years. But I must compliment the forces. ""I can confidently say after abrogation of Article 370, terror incidents, in comparison to the past, have now come down to almost nil (Lag bhag na ke barabar),"" he said. The defence minister also said that normalcy was fast returning to Kashmir. He was responding to an issue raised by Congress member K Suresh on the recent killings of a few people in terror incidents. Two people were killed and seven injured in blasts in Jammu and Kashmir's Anantanag district on Tuesday. In separate incidents last month, five migrant labourers from West Bengal were killed and two truck drivers were killed by terrorists. Suresh also accused the government of misleading the House that normalcy has been restored in the state. Singh said since the past five-and-half years, except Kashmir there has been no major incident in the country. In case of Jammu and Kashmir, it has been witnessing terror incidents since last 30-35 years, he said. Not satisfied with Singh's reply, Opposition members said normalcy has to be restored. Last week, home minister Amit Shah said in Rajya Sabha that total normalcy prevails in Kashmir with government offices and educational institutions functioning fully, but internet connection will be restored after the local administration feels it is fit to do so. He also asserted that not a single person has died in police firing since August 5 when the Centre abrogated special status of the state although many feared there would be bloodshed and more killings.

 Indian diplomat invokes Israel during meeting with Kashmiri Pandits | India News - Times of India,"NEW YORK: A top Indian diplomat in the US has said that the Kashmiri Pandits could return to the Valley soon because ""if the Israeli people can do it, we can also do it,"" sparking a controversy by mentioning the Israeli ""model"". During a private event in the city that was attended by some members of the Kashmiri Pandit diaspora, India's Consul General in New York Sandeep Chakravorty spoke about the Abrogation of Article 370. ""I believe the security conditions in Jammu and Kashmir will improve. It will allow refugees to go back and in your lifetime, you will be able to go back ... you will be able to go back to your home and you will find security. Because we already have a model in the world,"" he said, in an apparent reference to the Israeli settlement model. ""I don't know why we don't follow it. It has happened in the Middle East, you have to look, if the Israeli people can do it. We can also do it,"" he said in remarks that were recorded and then uploaded on social media. His remarks sparked a controversy with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan targeting the Indian government over its Kashmir policy. Reacting to the controversy, Chakravorty said that his remarks about Jammu and Kashmir and a reference to the Israeli issue have been taken out of context. ""I have seen some social media comments on my recent remarks. My remarks are being taken out of context,"" Chakravorty tweeted on Wednesday. Israel has built about 140 settlements since its occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967. The settlements are widely considered illegal under international law. The US recently said that it no longer believes the Israeli settlements are illegal. In his remarks during the meeting with the Kashmiri Pandits, Chakravorty also said that people have been talking about the Kashmiri culture. Referring to a comment made by a guest on the Israeli issue and Jewish issue, he said, ""they kept their culture alive for 2000 years outside the land and they went back. I think we all have to keep the Kashmiri culture alive. The Kashmiri culture is the Indian culture, it is the Hindu culture."" ""None of us can imagine an India without Kashmir,"" he said. He further said that he believes that in his lifetime, ""we will have our land back, our people have to go back…Give us some time, the government has done what it has done."" On August 5, India abrogated the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two union territories. The Indian government would not have taken such a big international risk only to do the amendment, Chakravorty said to applause. It was an international diplomatic struggle but ""we have successfully stalled it,"" he added. Pakistan reacted strongly to India's decision to abrogate Article 370 and downgraded bilateral ties and expelled the Indian envoy. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was an internal matter. It has also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Congress, SP, RJD do not work for people: Yogi Adityanath | India News - Times of India","BANSHIDHAR NAGAR: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday alleged that leaders of the Congress, Samajwadi Party and the RJD work only for their families and not for the people. Addressing a poll meeting here in Garhwa district, Adityanath said problems of the people would be solved when there are governments of the same party at the Centre and in the states. "" Leaders of the Congress, SP and the RJD only develop their families, purchasing property in the country and abroad,"" the UP chief minister claimed and urged the people to vote for BJP candidates in the assembly elections. Adityanath said it is the Narendra Modi government which abrogated Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, and no other government was able to take this step since Independence.

 Stone pelting reduced by 40-45 per cent after Article 370 abrogation: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Incidents of pelting stones at security forces in Jammu and Kashmir have reduced by 40-45 per cent since the abrogation of provisions under Article 370, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Wednesday. Speaking at an event, Shah said it took 70 years to abrogate the provisions and Prime Minister Narendra Modi resolved to do it. He said until provisions under Article 370 were abrogated, it was impossible to defeat terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. The home minister said Pakistan misguided the youth of the region, armed them and propagated terrorism. He added that India's response is determined by Pakistan's action and if they want peace, they'll have to end terrorism. Shah said the number of security forces deployed in Jammu and Kashmir today is the same as it has been since 1990. Additional forces deployed there have been removed, he added. From August till now, stone-pelting incidents have reduced by 40 to 45 per cent in Kashmir, the minister said. Referring to his strong reaction in Parliament while presenting bills on Jammu and Kashmir in the last session, the minister said his aggression was not against any one person or party but against the mismanagement of the security situation in the country. It is natural that the home minister of the country would react to such things strongly when the opposition questions the locus-standi of Parliament to make laws on this subject, he said. On the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, the Union minister said no other country will allow illegal migrants to settle down. India, similarly, would also not allow any illegal immigrant to settle within its borders and thus, NRC is of utmost importance, along with bringing the CAB, he said. The home minister said Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian refugees coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh because of religious persecution would be given Indian citizenship. He said these three are Muslim countries and people of other religions have been facing religious persecution there. These refugees take shelter in India to escape the situation, hence, they cannot be considered as illegal immigrants, Shah said. Taking such refugees into India's fold has been done in the country in the past by different governments as well, eg., for refugees coming from Uganda and Sri Lanka, he said. The minister said the Ram Mandir issue had stalled for many decades and political parties have used it for their vote bank politics. He said the Supreme Court has given an impartial judgment on the issue based on facts and not religious beliefs or faith and that has been welcomed by all religious beliefs and communities across the country, including the Muslims. Shah said the government would abide by the Supreme Court order and even one day more than the allocated 90 days would not be taken to comply with the order. The minister said as compared to Ram Mandir issue, Sabarimala issue is related to religious beliefs and faith and concerns with pilgrims praying in the temple. Ram Mandir issue was a civil suit relating to a land dispute, he said. The minister said political parties who are supporting Article 370 should come forward and name at least one benefit it brings. On the triple talaq issue, he said India has a rich culture and tradition to engage in debate and discussion on any issue based on facts and figures. The minister said as opposed to that, in the triple talaq issue, the opposition is up against this bold step taken by the government just for vote bank politics and their arguments have no basis in facts. The government was committed to take this decision for the empowerment of Muslim women in the country, Shah said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Govt non-committal on issue of restoring internet in J&amp;K | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday remained non-committal over the issue of restoring Internet facility in the Kashmir Valley. When the House was discussing issue of broadband and internet facility in rural areas of the country during Question Hour in Lok Sabha, National Conference MP Hasnain Masoodi said Internet has not been available in the Kashmir Valley for the last four months and asked when the facility will be restored.

However, Masoodi countered that he was asking a question on broadband and Internet facility. With this, Union minister of state for Electronics and Information Technology Sanjay Dhotre rose to reply that due to the security reasons, some restrictions have been imposed in Kashmir. ""The situation has improved a lot now,"" Dhotre said, without giving any indication when the Internet facility will be restored in Kashmir. Pre-paid mobile phones and all Internet services continued to remain suspended in Kashmir Valley since 5 August when the Centre announced the decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories. The minister said Internet is being currently accessed mainly through mobile wireless technologies, which at present covers more than 95 per cent of the population of the country. As of June 2019, the total number of Internet and broadband subscribers were 23.8 crore and 20.3 crore respectively in rural areas of the country, he said.

 Govt withdraws J&amp;K Reservation Bill | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday withdrew the J&K Reservation Bill from the Lok Sabha as central laws providing quota to the economically backward class are now applicable to the union territory post repeal of special provisions under Article 370. The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill 2019, was introduced in Lok Sabha by Home Minister Amit Shah on June 24.

" Strike balance between national security, rights: Supreme Court on J&amp;K | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said a balance has to be maintained between people's right to liberty and freedom of speech in Jammu and Kashmir and national security while putting restrictions in the aftermath of scrapping of special status of the erstwhile state. ""We have to strike a balance,"" a bench of Justices NV Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and BR Gavai said after hearing arguments of J&K administration and the petitioners opposing restrictions. The bench said a balance has to be maintained between Article 19(1) (a) which grants freedom of speech to citizens and Article 19(2) allowing government to impose reasonable restrictions on the right. Concluding his arguments justifying the restrictions, solicitor general Tushar Mehta brought to the court's notice various provocative statements made by leaders of mainstream political parties, including former chief ministers ahead of the Centre's decision to scrap Article 370 granting special status to the erstwhile state. He said politicians and separatists would have tried to incite people to resort to violence if the government had not taken preventive measures to cut off mobile, landline and internet connections. ""Leaders of major national parties were making all kinds of provocative statements saying local terrorists are sons of the soil and they are assets. They had also also said the government must not play with fire by tinkering with Article 35A and 370 and warned that the country will see what it had not seen since 1947. No government authority can ignore ground reality and such statements could not be ignored which could cause law and order problems,"" Mehta said. He said there was no en masse blockage of internet and 280 kiosks were opened for common people to get access to internet. He said the government had also set up media centres to facilitate journalists to carry on their duty. Countering the contentions of Mehta, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the government has projected one-sided picture and it is the fundamental duty of the state to allow citizens to have access to schools, hospitals and other facilities and there could not be a complete shutdown. Referring to government data of hospitals and schools, he said normalcy cannot be gauged on the ground that more than 99 percent of children are appearing for the exams and thousands of people are getting treatment in hospitals. Sibal said children are appearing in exams because they will lose academic year and it does not mean that all schools are running and the government has not given a comparative data how many people were treated in hospitals before and after August 5. He said ban on social media could be justified but not internet connection. ""If most of the people in J&K are peace loving which has been rightly accepted by the government then why they were not allowed to go to schools, hospitals etc. The court has to lay down law to protect the rights of people in such situations and the government cannot invoke national security to deny their rights,"" Sibal said.

Lieutenant Governor Girish Chandra Murmu led the celebrations of the Constitution Day by reading out the Preamble of the Constitution. The main function was held at the Assembly Complex here. Farooq Khan, Advisor to the Lt Governor, BVR Subrahmanyam, Chief Secretary, administrative secretaries, officers and officials of the Civil Secretariat were present on the occasion. November 26 has a unique historical significance as it was on this day in 1949 that the Constitution of India was adopted, and, thereafter, came into force on January 26, 1950, marking the beginning of the country as a republic. The erstwhile state of J and K had its own Constitution that was in place since 1957. But the Centre's decision to abrogate its special status under Article 370 and bifurcate it into two Union territories on August 5 ended that privilege. On Tuesday, divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners, heads of departments and heads of all police formations undertook activities in their respective offices to acknowledge the contribution of the framers of the Constitution and sensitise people regarding the exalted values and the precepts enshrined in it, an official statement said. All institutions, including government offices, read out the Preamble of the Constitution at 11 am followed by a pledge to uphold the fundamental duties.

Modi went on to add that “Congress has a habit of stalling critical issues. For 70 years, it did nothing about Article 370 and the Ayodhya land dispute for its vote bank. If they wanted, they could have come up with a solution… BJP wowed to solve these issues and we fulfilled our promises.” He said the central government will set up a steel factory in the region, but remain committed to protect “jal, jungal aur jameen” of the common people. In his second rally in Gumla, Modi reached out to the tribals saying, Lord Ram became ‘maryada purush’ only after he spent 14 years in exile among forest dwellers and adivasis. “When Ram was in Ayodhya, he was a simple rajkumar. But when he returned after 14 years of vanvas, he became maryada purush. This was because during his exile, he stayed and spent time among forest dwellers and adivasis. And Gumla is one of the places where Ram had stayed. Hanuman, too, stayed at Anjani Dham here.” Modi accused the Congress-JMM duo of going soft on quashing the Naxalism menace. “Give us a clear mandate again so that we can weed it out completely,” he said. During his speech, which centered heavily around tribals, PM Modi also said, “When a tribal leader from here, Karia Munda, became deputy speaker of Lok Sabha, our hearts filled with pride. Today, many tribals have become governors."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 First J&amp;K govt outreach to people after nullification of Article 370 | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir government attempted to reach out to people on Monday by conducting “back to village” programmes — the second phase of its flagship “Back to Village” plan but the first after the nullification of Article 370 and the reorganisation of the state into two Union Territories. The “Back to Village” (B2V-2) outreach is aimed at providing governance at the doorsteps of the rural populace and to enlist community participation. The week-long campaign will be more intense than the pre-August 5 phase. It shall follow up on B2V-1 (the programme’s first phase) and will focus on empowering panchayats, providing 100% coverage of beneficiary-oriented schemes, and doubling the income of rural people by giving greater impetus to the rural economy, an official spokesman said. The programme will see over 5,000 gazetted officers and 657 UT and directorate-level officers visit their assigned panchayats to receive first-hand appraisal reports about development works at the grassroots level. The officers shall prepare report cards and critical-gap analyses at the end of their two-day visits to the villages assigned to them. The lieutenant governor, advisers, chief secretary and other senior officers will be visiting various “halqa panchayats” in both Kashmir and Jammu divisions between November 25 and 30, 2019. One primary objective of B2V-2, which represents the institutionalisation of the “Back to Village” programme, is to handhold panchayats and assist them wherever they face impediments in using development funds based on local priorities to further strengthen grassroots democracy and participatory development. The programme will also assess the progress of resolution of a panchayat’s priority issues for which Rs 5 crore has already been released to each district. Emphasis will also be laid on creating awareness in the apple districts of Kashmir division through a programme on the “special market intervention price scheme” for the procurement of apple crops. Every line department has been assigned a specific role for this initiative and frontline workers of each department shall proactively participate to energise panchayats to achieve a total transformation of rural profiles. The programme will primarily involve government-public interactions, inaugurations of development works, awareness programmes on welfare schemes and on the effects of single-use plastic, convening of gram sabhas and public grievance redressal camps, besides seeking public feedback.

Yogi Adityanath: No party or individual bigger than nation | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: While addressing the students at 65th Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) convention in Agra on Monday, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that the nation is bigger than any individual or political party. He also complemented Prime Minister Narendra Modi for making “people’s will prevail” by scrapping Article 370 and resolving the 500 years old Ramjanam Bhoomi dispute”. The CM said that these two incidents in the past six months have sent a clear message across the world that India is capable of “maintaining peace and harmony”. Besides, it has also spread the message that India can give a befitting reply to those who cast an evil eye on it. Without naming any political party, the CM said that people took support of “religion”, “caste”, and “language”, and wanted to make the nation weak and powerless by dividing communities. These parties and its leaders claimed that there would be violence after the Ayodhya verdict, but not a single incident has happened. Similarly, after removal of article 370 from Kashmir, peace prevailed in the valley. Praising the ABVP, Yogi, said that this organisation has not become the largest students’ organisation across the country in one day and they have worked hard to prove that nation’s power is students’ power. “They never make false promises and do not become a tool in the hands of any political party and that is the reason they are the voice of students,” said the CM. The CM said that when his government was formed in the state, the condition of Basic Siksha Parishad (BSA) was very bad. “Our government has started School Chalo Abhiyan to improve the education status at the lower level and many other initiatives were taken being taken to brings up education levels,” said the CM. He added that five lakh students quit the board exams due to strict steps taken by the government to check cheating, but they were actually not students. “These were people who only wanted to get the certificates or mark sheets and were not bothered about the education,” he said, adding that the purpose of such exercises are to provide education to those who really want to study and do something in their lives. The government has planned to set up 18 residential schools for orphan children and those coming from labor class families. “The government will provide education to these children and also give sports training to those who want to excel in this direction. Besides, skill development courses will be available for those who want to make a career in them. Meanwhile, Sagar Reddy from Navi Mumbai was conferred the prestigious ‘Prof Yashwantrao Kelkar Youth Award, 2019’ by CM Yogi Adityanath during the 65th ABVP Conference. He has been conferred the award for his social service in looking after at-risk orphans above the age of 18 and working to rebuild their self-respect and all-round development.

" Detained Kashmiri leaders allowed to visit home, some may be released soon | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: Some of the Kashmiri political leaders who have been under detention since August 5 may be released soon, with the Union Territory administration already easing restrictions on their movement, officials said on Sunday. As many as four leaders belonging to various political parties were allowed to visit their houses for few hours on Saturday after they requested for it, they said. Some of the political leaders who are detained in their houses may be allowed to move out of the valley on health grounds, the officials said. There was a possibility of some of the detainees being released from the MLA hostel but a final plan will be worked out by the Union Territory administration with the Centre, they added. The leaders had been under detention since August 5 when the Centre announced abrogation of provisions of Article 370 and splitting the state into two union territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir. The union territories came into existence on October 31. Among those detained are three former chief ministers -- Farooq Abdulalh, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti. While senior Abdullah was slapped with the stringent Public Safety Act on September 17, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti have been detained at different locations in the city. Thirty-four political detainees were shifted to MLA hostel from Centaur hotel on November 18 as Srinagar reeled under harsh winter conditions and the hotel lacked proper heating arrangements, the officials said. The winter chill took a toll on the health of the detenues -- National Conference, PDP and People's Conference leaders and prominent social activists -- and the security personnel guarding them. Mehbooba Mufti was earlier shifted to a government accommodation in the city from a tourist hut located at the foothills of Zaberwan range.

" India faces challenge from new western Left in US, UK | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: If the US Congress is an influence-peddling battleground for India and Pakistan post-Article 370, India had a relatively good week. After being battered by Pakistan-sponsored voices in recent days, Indian and Indian-American sympathisers have reclaimed some of their voice. Three Congressional leaders have pushed back against a chorus against India and its actions in Jammu & Kashmir. Pete Olson, Francis Rooney and George Holding have all stood up in the House of Representatives to support India’s actions in the Valley. On Thursday, Francis Rooney said, “Islamic insurgents are a constant threat, spreading terror throughout J&K and elsewhere in India. We should support the government in Delhi in the continued fight against terror. India also faces an increasingly aggressive and assertive China that continues to export its malign influence throughout the Indo-Pacific region.” The concerns of Islamic extremism, which were almost absent in the earlier debate in the US, also reflect a problem India is facing in UK where political uncertainty and looming elections have seen a mobilisation against India. Groups claiming to represent Muslim interests have targetted candidates they see as “anti-Islamic” and Article 370 is in the direct line of fire. In the US, Pete Olson said earlier, “For 70 straight years, this temporary article has forced citizens of J&K to live under different laws than all other Indians ... Earlier this year, the Indian Parliament confirmed that Article 370’s temporary status should end. It gave the people of J&K the same rights as all Indians.” India’s diplomacy on Capitol Hill has had to be ramped up as Pakistan is on overdrive to sponsor or support anti-India initiatives through their diaspora as well as some well-funded lobby organisations. Initially, India was seen to be floundering before the system tapped into its resources both within the community and with the lawmakers to tell India’s story better. It is no coincidence that all three Congressmen are Republicans, a party that has been more understanding of India’s actions than the Democrats. That might become a bigger problem for two reasons — in the next elections, Democrats are expected to retake the House and their politics are moving so far to the Left that it might render them unsympathetic to India’s actions. It is much the same in UK where Labour has shifted more Left and there are elements of convergence with Muslim groups. In fact, former President Barack Obama sounded ala- rm bells about the “progressive” turn of the Democrats. Some go so far as to say that the party is now the playground for political opinion typified by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. These young political leaders are also believed to represent millennials and have conflated a strong liberal sentiment with “Islamophobia”. For their critics, they seem to endorse Islamists. India at this point is seen to be on the opposite side. It led to Indian-origin lawmaker Premila Jayapal to take a strong anti-Indian stance, as the current chair of the Progressive Democrats. Even older Democrat leaders like Brad Sherman and Eliot Engels who may have been more sympathetic to India believe they should sharpen their “liberal” credentials to win elections, say sources in Washington. The upshot is that the bi-partisan consensus that India enjoyed may become harder to maintain. Political watchers in London reckon the next Parliament might have Muslim heritage MPs as the largest minority group in the House. In the last week, Labour Party leadership did some course corrections and a letter issued by the Labour Party president Ian Lavery appeared to distance the party from its Kashmir resolution as well as Jeremy Corbyn’s comments. But this may only be a balancing act. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" First time in 109 days, restrictions lifted from Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid area | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: For the first time in 109 days, security restrictions were lifted from Srinagar's Jamia Masjid area on Friday even as the mosque remained shut. This is the 16th consecutive Friday that the grand mosque has remained locked since August 5, when the Centre nullified Articles 370 and 35A to withdraw J&K’s special status. “No restrictions were imposed in and around the Jamia Masjid on Friday. The Auqaf (mosque management) was asked to open the mosque and hold congregational prayers there,” a senior police officer said. Meanwhile, the shutdown enforced by terrorists paralysed life in Srinagar for the second consecutive day. Posters appeared on the shutters of shops and walls of the old city, asking businesses to stay shut, triggering a fresh wave of paranoia. Public transport was scarce, though private vehicles plied normally across Srinagar. A senior member of the Auqaf said prayers weren’t held because Hurriyat chief Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who heads the committee and delivers sermons at the mosque, was being kept under house arrest at his Nigeen residence since August 5. The police denied that he was under house arrest. The Auqaf member said the administration must first release the Mirwaiz from house arrest and withdraw security forces from in and around the mosque. Last Friday (November 15) too, police had informed the Auqaf to open the mosque and hold prayers, but the managing body had not responded and kept the mosque closed.

Such things do not make any impact as our troops are prepared for winter and respond befittingly,"" Jamwal said. He said though there is no major threat from drones and so far no incident of enemy drone citing has been reported from anywhere along the border in Jammu region, training programmes have been conducted for the troops to sensitize them to the possibility of such activities. ""The challenge is there, as we have seen dropping of weapons through drones in neighbouring states. We are alert and appropriate action will be taken (in case any drone is spotted in the region),"" the IG, BSF said. Asked about the number of terrorists present at launch pads across the border, he said such numbers are mostly based on speculation. ""However, the terrorists are waiting for an opportunity to sneak into this side. We too are waiting to take action whenever they try to infiltrate. You stay relaxed,"" the officer said. ""I want to assure the people of the country that they should have faith in the security forces who are fully prepared to deal with any challenge.

 Jharkhand election: Article 370 takes backstage in BJP's campaign | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Led by home minister Amit Shah, BJP had made nullification of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution a referendum on the Narendra Modi government in last month’s Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections. However, with the ruling party failing to win a majority on its own in both states, the issue has taken a backseat in the forthcoming Jharkhand assembly poll. Jharkhand goes to polls in five phases - on November 30, December 7, 12, 16 and 20. Counting of votes will take place on December 23. Shah kicked off the party’s campaign for the Jharkhand assembly election on Thursday. He addressed two election rallies - one each in Manika and Lohardaga. At both rallies, Shah referred to the nullification of Article 370, but unlike during the Maharashtra and Haryana polls, the BJP president did not say the party was ready for a referendum on Article 370 through the Jharkhand assembly poll. Further, Shah did not delve into several other issues which he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had brought up repeatedly during the Maharashtra and Haryana elections, such as the surgical strikes, air strikes and banning instant triple talaq. But Shah did bring up the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict on the Ram Mandir that was pronounced on November 9, accusing the Congress of stalling the case for all these years. He focused on the development works carried out by the BJP government in Jharkhand led by chief minister Raghubar Das. He also invoked 19th century tribal freedom fighter Birsa Munda. During the Maharashtra and Haryana elections, BJP had contested mainly on the Article 370 plank, linking it to nationalism. Opposition parties, meanwhile, focused on the state of the economy and jobs or the lack of it. Shah had then appealed to the people of Maharashtra to decide whether they were in favour of abrogation of Article 370 and 35A or against it. Narendra Modi also presented the abrogation of Article 370 as one of the main achievements of his government, even referring to Article 370 at the ‘Howdy, Modi!’ show at Houston in the US on September 22. But the strategy did not accrue dividends for the BJP. The party fell short of a majority on its own in both the states. While it managed to form the government in Haryana with the support of Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), in Maharashtra, its alliance partner Shiv Sena demanded the chief minister’s post as part of a 50:50 power-sharing formula following the former's less than stellar performance. The BJP, however, refused to yield to Shiv Sena’s demand, and according to latest development, Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray is on his way to form the government with the support of Congress and Sharad Pawar-led NCP.

"Mandir, Kashmir, reservation dominate Shah rallies in Jharkhand | Ranchi News - Times of India","RANCHI/LOHARDAGA: Setting the tone for the party's campaign in Jharkhand in its first big rally nine days before the first phase of polling, BJP national president and home minister Amit Shah accused Congress of blocking the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Supreme Court's historic verdict earlier this month. Addressing a large gathering at Manika in Latehar district about 100km from Ranchi in the first of his two public meetings on Thursday, Shah asked, "" Ayodhya mein Ram mandir banna chahiye ke nahi chahiye (Should a Ram temple be built in Ayodhya or not)?"" As the audience, led by BJP workers, responded to the question with a roar of 'Jai Shri Ram', Shah added in Hindi, ""Congress was not allowing the case be heard continuously. Now, the Supreme Court has delivered a historic verdict, paving the way for a grand temple touching the sky on Ramjanmabhoomi. Modiji is solving all the problems pending in the country one by one."" Shah went on to remind the people about the Modi government's ""historic"" decision to abrogate Article 370 and 35A, revoking special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcating the state into two Union territories. ""Congress allowed the Kashmir problem to continue for 70 years for its vote bank. The Modi government has wiped the blot off the crown of the country by abrogating these Articles,"" he said. Latehar is an SC-reserved seat and Shah struck the chord with young voters as he addressed the youngsters as "" mere jigar ke tukde yuva mitron (my most beloved young friends)"". Coming to local issues, Shah said the government will form a central commission for reservation to extend maximum benefits to youth from backward castes. ""We formed the OBC commission to give due respect to the backward castes. Now, to extend benefits of reservation to the youth, we will form a commission to provide them with jobs. We look at it as an opportunity to ensure financial security for the youth of a particular class that remained backward even after 70 years of Congress rule,"" he said. With chief minister Raghubar Das and BJP's Manika candidate Raghupal Singh and Latehar nominee Prakash Ram by his side, Shah, the BJP chief continued to attack Congress, ridiculing the budget allocated to Jharkhand by the regimes in the past. ""In the 13th Finance Commission, the Sonia-Manmohan government provided just Rs 55,253 crore for the development of Jharkhand. The Modi government has given Rs 3,08,487 crore, six times the amount, to the state for vikas,"" he said, reading out a detailed chart of schemes under which the money has been allocated. Shah enumerated the work carried out by the Raghubar Das government in Latehar, particularly Manika. ""An 80km road has been built to connect Mahuadar block to the district headquarters. In this assembly segment alone, 554km of roads have been constructed for Rs 300 crore and more than 1,675km 11kV transmission line have been installed. I challenge Congress to come up with its details of expenses in any assembly segment and compare it with ours,"" he said. He also lauded the state government for addressing the Maoist issue in the area. Shah also invoked nationalist sentiments by remembering the Jharkhand's freedom fighters - Nilambar Pitambar, Chand Bhairav and Birsa Munda. He also paid homage to son of the soil Lieutenant Anurag Shukla and Gumla soldier Vijay Soreng who were martyred while serving to the nation. While Soreng was killed in the terror attack on an Army convoy in Pulwama in February, Lt Shukla died in April while saving three of his colleagues from drowning at a training camp in Jaisalmer. Taking on Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the main opposition party in the state, Shah asked the people to understand that the tribal outfit has entered an alliance with the same Congress that believed in plundering the resources of Jharkhand. ""I want to ask Hemant Soren (former CM and JMM working president) what made him stand with the party that did nothing for the state in the 70 years of its rule at the Centre,"" he said. He also reminded the people that it was BJP and former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee who pioneered the formation of Jharkhand, a decision that Congress was against. Addressing his second rally in Lohardag later in the daya, Shah promised to set up a commission to review reservations for OBCs in Jharkhand if the party is voted back to power. Without naming any party, Shah said, ""If BJP is voted back to power in Jharkhand with full majority, we will set up a commission to review reservation based on population for OBCs and work towards the cause."" The focus on OBCs, political observes said, is a clear attempt to woo the party's estranged ally Ajsu Party's vote bank. After disagreements over seat-sharing, Ajsu Party decided to field candidates against its senior partner and promised to hike reservations for OBCs to 27% in its manifesto. Lohardaga, a seat reserved for Scheduled Tribe (ST), is a bone of contention contentious between the bickering allies. BJP has fielded Congress turncoat and sitting MLA Sukhdeo Bhagat while Ajsu Party has named Niru Bhagat. The two are up against state Congress president Rameshwar Oraon. In his 40-minute speech before 10,000-odd people at Lohardaga's sprawling BS College grounds, Shah was unsparing in attacking Congress and JMM on how the decades of misrule by the former led to massive corruption and scams and by siding with them, JMM too has shown its true colours. Accompanied by BJP candidates Misir Kujur (Gumla constituency), Sukhdeo Bhagat (Lohardaga) and Ashok Oraon (Bishunpur) and chief minister Raghubar Das, Shah continued to attack Congress over Ayodhya and Kashmir issues. Recalling the 2014 assembly elections, Shah said that BJP had launched its successful poll campaign at the same venue. ""This place produces a kind of metal that does not rust for years. You must ensure that you form a government that wont rust in five years. Press the lotus button so hard that the echoes are heard in Italy,"" Shah said. Applauding CM Das government, Shah cited how a ""garib ka beta"" led from the front to end naxalism and bring development to Jharkhand. ""Such progress was not possible earlier because of unstable governments. In 2014, we set out on a path to development when we installed a poor labourer's son as the CM. He worked tirelessly to free the state from naxal and bring in development,"" he said. Both Manika and Latehar constituencies will vote in the first leg of the five-phase polls on Novemeber 30. The results are scheduled be declared on December 23. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Arson and threat posters shut down Srinagar all over again | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: In a partial shutdown, shops remained closed and public transport stayed off roads in Srinagar and south Kashmir on Thursday following previous night’s arson and appearance of threatening posters in the city’s downtown areas. On Wednesday night, miscreants had set on fire four shops, as many street carts and a cab. Srinagar district magistrate Shahid Iqbal Choudhary on Thursday issued a strict warning to miscreants, who were threatening residents of the district. The DM urged people to immediately report instances of intimidation at local police stations, assuring them that action would follow immediately and that the miscreants would be dealt with sternly. Police said cases had been registered in all the incidents of fire and that investigation was on. Those involved in burning of these properties would be arrested soon, police said, adding that these incidents showed the ‘frustration’ of the people who wanted to prolong the shutdown in Kashmir. Shops and public transport, however, plied normally in north Kashmir on Thursday, reports said. All shops, business establishments and public transport, including cabs, had started functioning normally since November 16 after almost 100 days of shutdown starting August 5 when Parliament took the decision to nullify Article 370 and reorganize the state of J&K into two Union Territories. However, the problem resurfaced after Union home minister Amit Shah announced in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday that the situation in Kashmir had become normal. Soon after Shah’s Parliament remark, miscreants pasted posters at several places in the city, threatening people to observe shutdown in the Valley. Not just that, they also set on fire shops, carts and a cab, sources said. Public transport mostly stayed off city roads and some south Kashmir areas in reaction to the burning down of a Tavera vehicle (cab) in Nawa Kadal area of downtown Srinagar on Wednesday night. Similarly, shops and other business establishments in many areas of south Kashmir and Srinagar district, including commercial hub Lal Chowk, remained closed on Thursday following the burning down of shops and appearance of threating posters the previous night. Reports said that four shops were gutted in a fire incident in Bohri Kadal area of Srinagar. “The incident took place on Wednesday evening around 7pm,” an official source said, adding that the cause of the blaze was being ascertained. The source further said that four carts of street vendors were set on fire in Soura area of Srinagar around 10.30pm on Wednesday. Meanwhile, police in Awantipora arrested an associate of a terrorist for his involvement in threatening and intimidating locals in Tral area. He has been identified as Asif Ahmad Bhat, a resident of Larow Jageer, Tral. Read this story in BengaliDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" Amit Shah sets tone for Jharkhand election: Reservation commission for backwards, Ram temple at Ayodhya | India News - Times of India","RANCHI: BJP National president and Union home minister Amit Shah set the tone of BJP’s poll campaigning in Jharkhand from Manika in Latehar on Thursday. He clearly indicated that Ram Temple at Ayodhya, reservation for Other Backward Castes and Congress bashing is going to be the cardinal aspects of party’s campaign in the state that goes for the five phase polls from November 30. Flanked by outgoing chief minister Raghubar Das and the two BJP candidates—Raghupal from Manika and Prakash Ram from Latehar seat, Shah announced to form a central commission for reservation to extend maximum benefits to the youth belonging to the backward castes. “We formed the OBC commission to give due respect to the backward castes and now to extend benefits of reservation to the youth we are going to form a commission and dole out jobs. We look at it as an opportunity to ensure financial security for the youth of a particular class that remained backward during 70 years of congress rule,” he said. Latehar is a SC reserved seat and Shah struck the chord immediately as the saffron party heavily relies on young voters. He carefully addressed the youngsters as ‘mere jigar k tukde yuva mitra’ (my most beloved youngsters) while opening his remarks. Shah made an effort to sense public response over the issue of Ram Temple in Ayodhya and before elaborating he asked the crowd—“Ram mandir banna chahiye ke nahi chahiye” (whether Ram Temple should be constructed or not) and to his happiness the crowd led by BJP workers roared into slogans of Jai Shree Ram. Shah said “the Supreme Court has ruled that a temple as high as touching the sky should be built on Ramjanmbhoomi. This was a long pending issue and see it is because of Ram’s wish that Supreme Court gave its verdict,” he said, quickly adding “Modi ji is solving all pending problems of the country one by one.” He also reminded that it was BJP’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee who pioneered formation of Jharkhand separate state which was otherwise objected by the Congress. He also reminded the people about historical decision of Modi government in abrogating Article 370 and 35A from Jammu and Kashmir. “Modi government successfully wiped off the blot from the crown of the country by abrogating these Articles,” he said.

 India rejects unwarranted reference by Pakistan to Jammu and Kashmir at UNSC | India News - Times of India,"UNITED NATIONS: India has strongly rejected references to Kashmir by Pakistan in the UN Security Council and asserted that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of the country. Pakistan's newly appointed envoy to the UN Munir Akram, speaking in the Council for the first time since assuming charge, raked up the issue of Kashmir. Akram said the Security Council has had uneven record in resolving threats to and breaches of international peace and security and there has been prolonged inaction in some cases. He said Pakistan is concerned at the absence of action by the Security Council over the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. In response to Akram's remarks, India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said, ""We reject an unwarranted reference by the delegation of Pakistan…to the situation in an integral part of India. Let me recall that both sides have solemnly agreed to resolve such issues through means as agreed to by the parties."" On August 5, India revoked Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. India has always maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is its integral part and ruled out any third party mediation, including either from the UN or the US, saying it is a bilateral issue with Pakistan In his remarks during the UN Security Council open debate on Peacebuilding and sustaining peace Tuesday, Naidu said reconciliation is a crucial step in stopping the cycle of violence and insecurity in post-conflict situations, and in building sustainable peace. ""Given the immense complexities and unique local context of each post-conflict theatre, there can be no one-size fits all template for such dynamic situations. Reconciliation is a long and arduous process, and artificially imposed standards or timelines are unlikely to achieve success,"" he said. He said India believes that reconciliation has to be a truly home-grown process. The inherent limits on the breadth, depth and duration of any external peace-building mission suggests that deep-rooted, sustainable change of the kind peacebuilding seeks to bring about requires the long-term support and commitment of a critical mass of domestic actors, including civil society, youth, women and religious leaders. He further said that well-meaning reconciliation efforts of the UN or the wider international humanitarian community may not be in tune with the realities on the ground. ""Expecting domestic actors to uncritically embrace external norms and ideas as inherently superior to domestic ones is unrealistic,"" he said. Naidu noted that conflict ""corrodes and destroys"" human, infrastructural and institutional capacities, which need to be rebuilt if national actors are to exercise a meaningful degree of ownership over events in the post-conflict period. ""While it would be a mistake to overlook domestic institutions and practices as sources of peace building, it would be erroneous to uncritically romanticise them,"" he said. He asserted that India believes that for a truly effective and credible international justice system, ""we must avoid selectivity, partiality, and double standards in the application of rule of law at the global level."" In this context, India's view is that the UN must play a supportive and facilitating role, which is non-prescriptive. The UN must ensure inclusiveness, ownership and participation of all stakeholders in the reconciliation process. ""Equally important is UN's support for humanitarian assistance, protection and promotion of human rights, and facilitation of political reconciliation processes, in accordance with the principles of neutrality and impartiality.""

" Relaxing curbs, pleas alleging complete clampdown in Kashmir incorrect, irrelevant: Centre to SC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday told the Supreme Court that it had been relaxing the curbs imposed in Jammu and Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370 and claimed that the pleas alleging ""complete clampdown"" was incorrect and irrelevant. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and Union Territory Jammu Kashmir, commenced his submissions before a bench headed by Justice NV Ramana and justified certain restrictions imposed in the region after the abrogation of Article 370 which had given special status to the then state of Jammu and Kashmir. Mehta told the bench that relaxations have been given in the region since August 13 and it was not a complete clampdown as projected by petitioners and said that the pleas including one filed by senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, alleging restrictions, are incorrect, irrelevant and have out-lived their utility. He said that various central legislations were not applicable in the state before abrogation of Article 370 and laws such as Right to Information and prohibition of child marriage were not applicable to the state earlier. The Solicitor General told the bench that the authorities have applied their minds in imposing or lifting curbs in the region and services such as post-paid mobile service restarted on October 14 in Jammu and Kashmir. ""Schools have reopened, moreover 917 schools were never shut after abrogation of Article 370,"" Mehta told the bench also comprising justices R Subhash Reddy and BR Gavai.

Supreme Court to Jammu &amp; Kashmir: Answer every question raised on restrictions imposed in Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday told the Jammu and Kashmir administration that it will have to respond to each and every question raised on the restrictions imposed in the erstwhile state after the abrogation of Article 370. A bench headed by Justice NV Ramana told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the administration, that petitioners challenging the restrictions have argued in detail and he will have to answer all questions. ""Mr. Mehta you have to answer each and every question raised by the petitioners who have argued in detail. Your counter affidavit does not help us to come to any conclusion. Don't give the impression that you are not giving enough attention to the case,"" said the bench, comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and BR Gavai. Mehta said most of the averments made by the petitioners on restrictions are ""incorrect"" and he will respond to each and every aspect when he argues in court. The solicitor general said he has a status report with him but he has not filed it in the court as the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is changing every single day and would like to show to the court the exact status at the time of his submission. At the outset, the top court clarified that except for one petition it does not have any detention matters pending before it. ""We are not hearing any detention matters with regard to Jammu and Kashmir. We are currently hearing two petitions filed by Anuradha Bhasin and Ghulam Nabi Azad which are on restrictions in freedom of movement, press, etc,"" it said, adding that only one habeas corpus petition is pending. It said only one habeas corpus (against detention of a business man) is pending because the petitioner had simultaneously moved before the J&K high court and the Supreme Court. ""Now they have withdrawn from the high court and hence the petition is pending here,"" the bench said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Schools reopen in Valley as life limps back to normalcy | Srinagar News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Several schools reopened here on Tuesday after remaining closed for over three months due to the unannounced shutdown following the Centre's decision to abrogate Article 370 provisions, even as life was inching towards normalcy in Kashmir, officials said. The move by several private schools to resume classes came as public transport has started to ply in the Valley and life was fast returning to normalcy, they said. The managements have decided to open the schools from 10 am to 1 pm and students have been asked to come without wearing the uniform, the officials said. The city and most areas elsewhere in the valley saw a significant improvement in the movement of public transport on Monday. The officials said the intra-district as well as the inter-district connectivity has improved significantly. Auto-rickshaws and inter-district cabs have been plying for a while now, but in the last few days, the movement of intra-district cabs across the valley has also increased, they added. The officials said the private transport was plying unhindered. On Sunday, the rail service from Srinagar to Banihal also resumed. The train service in the valley was suspended due to security reasons on August 3 - days before the Centre abrogated the Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcated the state into two Union territories. The Centre's decision on August 5 led to an unannounced shutdown in the valley even as authorities imposed severe restrictions which were later gradually eased out. While the shutdown continued in some areas, markets at most places have been following a new pattern of functioning -- opening early morning till around the noon. The shopkeepers down their shutters in the afternoon -- at some places in the late afternoon -- to join the protest against the abrogation of the special status of the state, the officials said, adding a few shops in the civil lines of the city remained open throughout the day on Monday. Pre-paid mobile phones and all internet services in the Valley continue to remain suspended since 5 August. Most of the top level and second rung separatist leaders have been taken into preventive custody, while mainstream leaders including two former chief ministers -- Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti -- have been either detained or placed under house arrest. The government has detained former chief minister and sitting Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar Farooq Abdullah under the controversial Public Safety Act, a law enacted by his father and National Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978 when he was the chief minister.

 Understand India’s security preoccupations in Kashmir: Federica Mogherini | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Nov 19, 2019)Federica Mogherini, high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy & Vice-President of the European Commission, told Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury in an email interview that the EU understands India’s security preoccupations in Kashmir and elaborated on the strengthening bilateral strategic partnership. Excerpts:What is your opinion on Kashmir following India’s decision to abrogate article 370 which is essentially an internal affair?I discussed the matter with minister S Jaishankar on several occasions. Our position has not changed. We understand India’s security preoccupations, but restrictions on fundamental freedoms remain. Some steps have been taken, but it remains crucial that freedom of movement and means of communication are fully restored, as well as access to essential services to all Kashmiris. What is your opinion on visit by EU MEPs to Kashmir?The visit was not an official visit of the European Parliament. MEPs were participating in their individual capacity. What is your opinion on the efforts to revive negotiations on free trade agreement?The EU is the first trade and investment partner of India. More than 6,000 European firms are established in India. But there is much more that we can do to unleash the full potential of our economic partnership, including by working together towards ambitious, balanced , comprehensive and mutually beneficial trade and investment agreements. The EU and India believe in a multilateral trade system open and fair, with the WTO at its core. We are partners in the G20 and together we can work , to supporting growth and sustainable development not just in Europe and in India, but worldwide. What is current state of India-EU strategic partnership in the context of India’s renewed focus on Europe?The strategic partnership between the EU and India is driven, as one might expect, by being the two largest democracies in the world. We believe in multilateralism and in a cooperative approach to international relations, with the UN (United Nations) at its centre. We are spearheading efforts to fight climate change, both in the global arena and in the way we are transforming our economies through renewable energy.. The EU and India are also at the cutting edge in innovation, in fostering the digital transformation which has the potential to open new frontiers for future generations. In short, the common agenda is broad and ambitious, but at the same time there is a lot of room to do more. India & EU decided to form military partnership and add more meat to counter terror ties. Can you update on this?Our cooperation on security and defence matters has progressively expanded over the past few years. The first maritime passing exercise between the Indian Navy and the EU’s counter piracy operation – Operation Atalanta - off the coast of Somalia was held in 2017. In 2018, the Indian Navy escorted a World Food Programme vessel at the request of Operation Atalanta. Military to military contacts have been established since. Consultations take place on counterterrorism, including on terrorist financing, terrorist designations and counter radicalisation. Europol, the EU’s agency for law enforcement cooperation, is in regular contact with counterparts in India. The EU and India also hold a regular cyber security dialogue to exchange best practice. Not only should we be consolidating this cooperation, but we are also looking to explore new areas of interest. Can you update on India-EU connectivity partnership in Indo-Pacific and efforts at rules based world order?The way we choose to connect our societies, countries and regions will shape the 21st century. That’s why we need to do it in the right way. And with India, we have a natural partner. We share a vision whereby connectivity is transparent, inclusive and sustainable; where what we do, create and build leaves nobody behind. High standards and a level playing field are also crucial for the success of connectivity initiatives. Based on this common vision there is ample scope for working together. And as always, our work will be guided by respect for international law and working within or towards a conducive multilateral framework. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Few minutes before the lunch break, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was to argue on behalf of the J&K administration, appeared before the bench and said that he was absent as he was appearing before a Constitution bench in the land acquisition case. The court’s observation had an impact and additional solicitors general Vikramajit Banerjee and K K Nataraj were seen sitting in the front row during the hearing after lunch. While challenging the clampdown imposed in J&K after the Centre’s August 5 decision to defang Article 370 and split it into two UTs, senior advocate Dushyant Dave said more than 100 days had passed and the court should decide the issue on a priority basis as it involved violation of fundamental rights of all people in J&K. Raising question on how can a democratic country can impose complete clampdown, Dave referred to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong and said people are allowed there to take to the streets to protest against the communist government. He said the apex court must intervene and protect the fundamental rights of people. Referring to the Kerala High Court ruling that access to internet is a fundamental right which cannot be taken away arbitrarily, Dave said blocking access to communication in J&K was arbitrary and done by the government to avoid criticism. The hearing remained inconclusive and will resume on November 21. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Pakistan in no way friend of J&amp;K people; it has only brought destruction: Police chief | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR/ JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir police chief Dilbag Singh on Tuesday asserted that Pakistan is in no way a friend of the people of the Union territory and said the neighbouring country has only brought death and destruction for them. He also said Pakistan's proxy war against India is not over yet and the police force will continue fighting the enemy to ensure the nation's safety. Singh made the remarks in an official statement after a visit to Handwara town of Kupwara district and Ganderbal district. During his visit, the director general of police (DGP) reviewed the law and order situation in different areas, interacted with the respective jurisdictional officers and also addressed 'darbars' of police personnel. ""Pakistan is in no way a friend of the people of Jammu and Kashmir as it has brought death and destruction, and disrupted the peace and order here,"" Singh said. The proxy war that Pakistan is waging against India is not over yet and ""we will continue our fight to defeat the enemy for the security and integrity of our nation,"" he said. He also called on officers and jawans to foil the ""wicked acts or designs"" of elements inimical to the peace and prosperity of Jammu and Kashmir. ""Subversion and terrorism are to be uprooted so that the general masses can live in a peaceful atmosphere, which is our priority,"" Singh said. Lauding the police force for maintaining peaceful atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir, he said during the previous years, particularly in 2010 and 2016, police had faced a tough situation on the law and order front. ""This time around the force has worked with extreme professionalism in maintaining law and order,"" the DGP said, in an apparent reference to the security challenges that followed the abrogation of certain provisions of Article 370 by the Centre on August 5. Singh said police and other security forces had contributed in one way or the other in maintaining normalcy and defeating the designs of anti-national elements. He said police personnel had remained at the forefront of efforts to maintain peace and public order without caring about their own comfort. The good work done by police and other forces is being recognised at every forum and by the central government, he said. Singh also asked the officers to take up the drive against drugs as a mission until the menace is uprooted from the society. Police is strengthening its bonds with the people who are in turn supporting the force in its fight against drugs, he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Political engagement should resume in J&amp;K sooner than later: BJP's Ram Madhav | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Highlighting that over 100 days have passed since the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, senior BJP leader Ram Madhav on Tuesday said he is in favour of the resumption of political engagement in the Union Territory ""sooner than later"". Saying that ""the sky is the limit"" when it comes to demands from various quarters on the issue of Jammu & Kashmir, he emphasised that the demands should be within the ambit of the Constitution. ""I am personally in favour of, at least now that almost 100 days have passed since the decision was taken, some kind of a political engagement to start in the Valley,"" he said at an event. ""I am talking about it (beginning political engagement in the Valley) in my party also. Hopefully, we will be able to do something about it,"" said Madhav, the BJP's National General Secretary, adding that normal political activities have been going on in Jammu. To a question about what prevents the government from releasing political leaders in Kashmir from preventive custody, he said whether the government states its position or not, ""there is no doubt"" that the day these leaders are out they will certainly lead protests. ""We will also have to ensure that those protests need to be democratic and peaceful. That is expected. Nobody says there should not be any protest. It is a democracy, protests will be there,"" he said. Refusing to speculate about what could be the plans of the security establishment in Delhi or in Srinagar in this regard, he said: ""engagement at political levels needs to be resumed sooner than later"". Mainstream leaders in the Valley, including three former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir, were taken into preventive custody in the wake of the Centre's August 5 decision to revoke the special status of the state, now a union territory, under Article 370 of the Constitution. While Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti remain under house arrest, Farooq Abdullah has been detained under the controversial Public Safety Act since September 17. Madhav said the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir has undergone major transformation since the abrogation of Article 370. ""So new kind of political activities will resume whenever the first opportunity comes. I am very keen that opportunity should come as soon as possible,"" he said, addressing a discussion on 'Kashmir After 370' organised by think tank Observer Research Foundation (ORF). Madhav said the decision on opening up of the ""political space"" in Jammu and Kashmir will be taken together by the union territory's administration and the central government. ""I have said it earlier also, that the sky is the limit for people to make demands. But what is expected is that it should be within the framework of the Indian constitution. Within that, any kind of political demand can be raised. ""So that kind of political space should be made available to people of Jammu and Kashmir, that's my firm conviction. How early it can happen is for the administration in Jammu and Kashmir and the government in Delhi to decide together,"" he suggested. Participating in the dialogue, senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor questioned the preventive detention of political leaders in Kashmir. ""It certainly raises a question: what is the yardstick you are waiting for? Because remember there were no objective disturbances that prompted the arrest in the first place,"" he said. Tharoor said the amount of protests the leaders could engineer whenever they are released, whether it is three months from now or if they were released three months ago, will be the same. ""So ultimately the logic has never been understood by many of us as to why to detain them in the first place,"" he said, adding: ""I am at a loss to figure out on what objective basis can we say 'now the conditions have arrived for the release' because the conditions are in entirely your (government) own control"". About the situation in the region, Tharoor said things are pretty bad in Jammu and Kashmir. ""What happened in August and thereafter has done us a great deal of damage internationally... It would require tremendous efforts for us to regain our lost ground. The ground we have lost is very severe,"" he said. Countering him, Madhav said only around 200 political leaders are in detention. ""Are we trying to say that in entire Kashmir there are those 200 leaders. No? There are many more outside.

 765 arrested in J&amp;K for stone pelting since abrogation of Article 370 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: As many as 765 persons were arrested in 190 stone-pelting and ‘law-and-order’ cases reported in Jammu & Kashmir between August 5, the day Article 370 became a dead letter, and November 15, 2019. Compared to this, 361 instances of stone-pelting or law and order disruptions were reported in the erstwhile state between January 1 and August 4, according to data put out by the home ministry in reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. While minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy claimed in the reply that this marked a decline in stone-pelting incidents in J&K since August 5, the monthly average of the pre-abrogation incidents works out to around 51 incidents and for the post-abrogation period, 58 incidents. According to sources in the intelligence agencies, stone-pelting incidents have, however, come down significantly from the high recorded in August and September. Meanwhile, in reply to another Lok Sabha question, Reddy informed that over 34 lakh tourists had visited J&K over the last six months, of which 12,934 were foreign tourists. A total income of nearly Rs 25 crore was earned through tourism within this period, he added. The MoS stated in yet another reply that attendance in Valley’s schools, which was thin in the initial days after abrogation of Article 370 but picked up gradually, was reported at 99.7% during the ongoing examinations. Besides, he added, pellet guns were used “as a matter of abundant caution, only to deal with severe law and order problems, to avoid civilian casualties”. On a question relating to ceasefire violations after the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, he said 950 instances were recorded along the LoC during August and October. Reddy, in the reply seeking an update on stone-pelting cases in J&K, said the government had initiated a multi-pronged strategy to check stone pelting, as part of which it had identified a large number of trouble makers, instigators and mob mobilisers. To keep them out of circulation, preventive measures including detention under Public Safety Act (PSA) and preventive arrests had been taken. The MoS said various separatist organisations and activists affiliated to the Hurriyat Conference were found by NIA investigations to be behind the incidents of stone-pelting in the Valley.

Pakistan resumes postal mail service with India: Report - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has resumed postal mail service with India, nearly three months after it was suspended in the wake of India's decision to end the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, the Pakistan media reported on Tuesday. Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after New Delhi abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories. India's August 5 decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties. Islamabad suspended all communication links with India as well as the trade ties. According to the Pakistani media, the postal mail service with India has resumed, but the parcel service will remain suspended. However, there was no official announcement on the resumption of the limited postal service with India. Pakistan had not accepted any postal consignment from India after August 27 in a move seen as a retaliation of scrapping of special status for Jammu and Kashmir. Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who is also in-charge of the postal department, said in October that Islamabad resorted to stopping postal mail service unilaterally and without giving any prior notice to India. ""Pakistan's decision is directly in contravention of world postal union norms. But Pakistan is Pakistan,"" Prasad had said. Pakistan's move was unprecedented as the postal mail service had continued in the past even through the partition, wars, and cross-border tensions.

" Maharashtra talks move slowly, Sharad Pawar sidesteps queries | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Amid indications of cautious progress in talks between Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) over government formation in Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar sprang a surprise by claiming he did not discuss alliance with Shiv Sena or government formation in the state with Sonia Gandhi during his 45-minute meeting with the Congress chief on Monday evening. The NCP boss visited 10, Janpath for a discussion with the Congress president, in what had been billed as a crucial moment for government formation. Talking to reporters after the meeting in which Congress leader A K Antony was also present, Pawar made the surprise claim that a coalition with Sena was not on the table. “We did not discuss government formation with any party. We just discussed numbers, who has how many. We will keep an eye on the situation,” he added. The NCP chief said he would talk about the political situation with smaller allies like Peasants and Workers Party, Shetkari Sangathan and Samajwadi Party, who were angry at not being involved, calling it the only “new development in the old situation”. Significantly, Sena leader Sanjay Raut met Pawar after the latter’s meeting with Sonia. Pawar’s refusal to indulge queries about alliance with Sena was baffling as just two days ago, he said in Nagpur a government in the state would be formed by NCP, Congress and Sena, which would run for its full term. Maharashtra: Shiv Sena camp baffled by Sharad Pawar’s talk, feels distance from NCP is best optionReacting to his latest remarks, a senior Congress leader said, “I am surprised by Pawar’s statement.” Significantly, in a statement issued before Pawar talked to reporters, Congress had said, “Sharad Pawar met the Congress president today and briefed her on the situation in Maharashtra. It was decided that in a day or two, representatives from NCP and Congress will meet in Delhi to discuss the way forward.” Pawar’s remarks coincide with the assessment that developments unspooling in Maharashtra have strengthened the Maratha warhorse’s position, enhancing the advantage he gained by leading his NCP to a better-than-expected performance, BJP’s sub-par show and its break-up with Sena. In contrast, Sena’s exit from the NDA without a countervailing arrangement with NCP-Congress may have weakened its hand, rendering it vulnerable to even stronger bargaining from NCP. Shiv Sena, BJP have to choose their paths: Sharad PawarCongress may have also gained but not as much as Pawar, who is leading the negotiations and has come to the table with the aura of an odd-defying survivor. He seems to be having a better grasp than others of the flux, at least since November 11 when he, in another surprise move, did not underwrite Sena’s claim of majority support. Congress’s fear that its members may bolt if it ends up on the opposition benches yet again can also be advantageous to NCP. Pawar’s curious turn came even as the potential partners appeared to be making cautious progress towards hashing out a common minimum programme. Congress, which unlike NCP is more sensitive about getting into a political clinch with the hardline Hindutva outfit, has been keen that Sena smoothen its sharp ideological edges: its anxiety reflected by Antony’s presence during Sonia’s deliberations with Pawar. Given that they hail from rival political spectrums of ‘Hindutva’ and ‘secularism’, the expectation is that divergence in their stance on critical issues should be minimum. While Ayodhya and Article 370 are already out of the way, sensitive subjects like Uniform Civil Code and Citizenship Amendment Bill are still in discussion and could erupt if not blunted beforehand. Though the concerns are obvious, sources said the feedback from discussions over the last few days was that the parties had narrowed their differences. A study of Sena’s state manifesto, too, is seen as bereft of any future flashpoints, which can facilitate the way for a common minimum programme. Asked if it was a positive sign that Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was learnt to have dropped the idea of visiting Ayodhya which he had announced earlier, Pawar shot back, “Do I decide where Uddhav Thackeray has to go?” In Video:No talk about government formation at meet with Congress: NCP chief Sharad PawarDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"Narendra Modi:   There is a difference between ‘checking and clogging’, PM Modi tells Rajya Sabha | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Urging MPs to adopt the path of debate and not resort to stalling business in the name of “checks and balance”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the critical role of Rajya Sabha in passing historic bills while underlining that there was a difference between “checking and clogging”. The PM spoke of decisions like nullifying Article 370, banning triple talaq, the law to usher in a goods and services tax and the constitutional amendment pertaining to reservation for the economically weak. Modi emphasised how the House had moved with changing circumstances to assimilate new ideas over time. The PM was speaking during a discussion on the 'Role of Rajya Sabha in Indian Polity and the Way Forward' on the first day of the 250th session of the House on Monday. Modi asserted that the role of Rajya Sabha in ensuring “checks and balances” in democracy was critical but it was important to know the difference between “checking and clogging” and “balance and blocking”. “It is the same House which was under scrutiny as there was debate whether the House will pass triple talaq bill or not and there were views that it will get stalled. Instead, it was passed and reflects the maturity of this House that enabled a major step in the direction of women’s empowerment,” he said. The PM also cited examples of the bill on 10% reservation on economic criteria in general category. He said the upper House was “permanent, eternal and diverse”. “This House enables bringing forth experience of some of the most knowledgeable people from various fields who may not be able to win an election to Lok Sabha but their experience is valuable and much needed,” he added. He cited B R Ambedkar as someone who for some reason was not able to go to Lok Sabha but benefited the country with his knowledge as an RS member. Though he did not touch on it, BJP has blamed Congress for preventing Ambedkar’s election to Lok Sabha. Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu urged MPs to do some soul searching. “We still have miles to go and make up for the time lost and opportunities missed, and in particular, about the functioning of this august House. All is not well. There is a lot to be desired with widespread public concerns over the way we have been conducting ourselves in the House,” he said. He suggested that there should be adequate sittings in the context of the House meeting for about 60-70 days in a year now, keeping in view the nature and volume of legislations and time available for discussing issues of public importance.

For the first time in 105 days, unauthorised hawkers in busy areas like Lal Chowk - who used spaces outside closed shops to put up their stalls – could not do business as the commercial establishments were opened through the day. “I came to set up my stall at the Polo View, which I have been doing for the past few months. But, today, police told me that I cannot set up my stall here as regular shops are opening,” Muzaffar Ahmad, a street vendor, said. Similarly, J&KSRTC buses plied across districts through the day for the first time on Monday.

 Fewer terror incidents post-Aug 5 than in same period last year | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Incidents of terrorist violence in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 on August 4 have surpassed the numbers reported in the preceding period of 2019, but were less than the corresponding period of last year. Most incidents since August 5 were of lesser intensity and pertained to terrorists threatening civilians against resuming normal daily activities, according to sources in the Central security establishment. There was a 36% fall in terrorist incidents in J&K in the first 10 months of 2019 as compared to corresponding period of 2018, J&K DGP Dilbag Singh told TOI on Monday. As many as 294 incidents were recorded in J&K between August 5 and November 14, as compared to 287 between January 1 and August 4 this year. An intelligence officer said that though incidents since August 5 were marginally higher than those in the preceding 7 months, they were much less than in the corresponding period of preceding years. “Besides, many incidents related to terrorists putting up posters or issuing verbal threats asking people to stay indoors,” said the officer. Most of the 14 civilians killings recorded in the erstwhile state over 102 days since August 5 — as compared to 20 from January 1 to August 4, 2019 — were carried out by terrorists to enforce their diktat asking locals not to open shops or get involved in apple trade. “But not a single civilian was killed in the past 3 months in a law and order incident,” said a police officer. Just two security force personnel in J&K were killed since August 5, as compared to 77 until August 4 this year.

" With praise for NCP in Rajya Sabha, Modi sparks speculation | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Speaking on the 250th session of the Rajya Sabha, Prime Minister Modi praised the NCP, a party that has emerged as a kingmaker in Maharashtra, sparking speculation amid the political deadlock in the state. The PM praised NCP and BJD for deciding to stay away from the well of the House. Calling the Upper House ""eternal"", Prime Minister Modi stressed the significance of the House. From mentioning abrogation of Article 370 to triple talaq Bill, Modi highlighted how ""historic"" the House has been. Praising the Rajya Sabha, he said it was the House's maturity that ensured the Bill on Triple Talaq and the one on GST were passed, in spite of opposition to it. Mentioning abrogation of Article 370, Modi said, ""Whenever it has been about national good, the Rajya Sabha has risen to the occasion and made a strong contribution. ""We can never forget the role of the Rajya Sabha when Bills pertaining to Articles 370 and 35(A) were passed. This House has worked to further the unity of the counrty."" Taking a subtle dig at opposition, he said, ""It was believed that the Bill on Triple Talaq would not pass here, but it did."" The BJP-led NDA lacked the numbers in the Upper House, yet the House was able to pass it. PM Modi called the Rajya Sabha as the ""supporting house"", stressing the important role it plays to keep ""checks and balances"". Taking about cooperative Centre-state relationship, he saisd, ""Our Constitution inspires us to work for a welfare state. It also motivates us to work for the welfare of states. The Rajya Sabha, as the Council of States, enables us to further the spirit of cooperative federalism."" But in a statement that is likely to be seen from political prism, the PM praised the NCP and BJD for taking a stated position to stay away from the well in Parliament. He said, ""Today I want to appreciate two parties, NCP and BJD. These parties have wonderfully adhered to parliamentary norms. They have never ventured into the well. They have made their points very effectively. Much can be learned from these practices."" The comment assumes significance as BJP in spite of getting 105 seats is not being able to form government in Maharashtra and the NCP appears to be the kingmakers.

 J&amp;K admin shifts 33 political detainees to Srinagar hostel | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Sunday shifted 33 political detenues, including JKPP president and former minister Sajjad Lone and former PDP minister Naeem Akhtar, from Centaur Lake View Hotel near Dal Lake — where they had been lodged since the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5 — to the MLA Hostel in Srinagar’s Maulana Azad Road which has better heating facilities, to cope with the harsh weather conditions in the upcoming winter season. A JKPP spokesperson alleged that party chief Sajjad Lone was manhandled by police during the shift after he and some other detenues, including PDP’s Waheed Parray, protested against the move, refusing to stay at the MLA Hostel because of “unhygienic conditions” at the facility. Officials, however, refuted the allegation. The Centaur hotel, owned by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation, has submitted a bill of more than Rs 3 crore to the home department for over 100 days of boarding and lodging of the detenues. The administration refused to pay this since the facility had already been declared a subsidiary jail. Instead, the authorities sanctioned a daily fee of Rs 800 per room as compared to Rs 5,000 charged by the hotel. The MLA Hostel has been declared a subsidiary jail by the J&K home department to temporarily house the political detenues and is being looked after by the government hospitality team and protocol department. Authorities have installed CCTV cameras in and around the premises for security, said an official. Over 40 political leaders and prominent social activists had been detained at the hotel, which was declared as a subsidiary jail on August 5 when the Centre abrogated Article 370, paving the way for the bifurcation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh. Since then, all detenues were being provided with facilities mentioned under the jail manual. Some of them were later released while the remaining were shifted to the hostel on Sunday. Last Thursday, former J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti was also shifted to a government-owned VIP bungalow at Maulana Azad Road from the tourist hut situated at the foothills of Zaberwan range where she had been detained earlier.

 From Citizenship Bill to opposition offensive on economic slowdown - Winter Session expected to see much heat | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Parliament's Winter Session starting tomorrow is expected to witness much heat as the Opposition looks to corner the Union government over issues like economic slowdown and situation in Kashmir while the Modi dispensation seeks to push through the contentious Citizenship (amendment) Bill, a key part of the BJP's ideological agenda. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his customary remarks at a session eve all-party meeting held on Sunday asserted that the government is ready to discuss every issue and exhorted everyone to make the Winter session as productive as the last one, when Parliament gave its nod to the bifurcation of the then state of Jammu and Kashmir and nullifying Article 370, besides several other important bills. Opposition leaders, including Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress, raised the continuing ""illegal"" detention of mainstream leaders in Jammu and Kashmir like Farooq Abdullah, who is also a Lok Sabha member, and said they will take up issues like economic slowdown and unemployment in the session, which ends on December 13. After the BJP-led NDA left the opposition stunned in the last session by winning over independent regional parties, especially in Rajya Sabha where treasury benches lacked majority, and wooing a number of rival leaders to get a host of bills passed, the Congress-led grouping has some reasons to feel emboldened over recent political developments, Its better than expected show in the recent assembly polls, BJP's break in ties with Shiv Sena and reports of economic slowdown have put wind in the sails of opposition parties. The 18 Sena MPs in Lok Sabha and three in Rajya Sabha have now been allotted seats in the opposition rows after the party severed ties with its longtime ally BJP and is in talks with the Congress-NCP alliance to form government in Maharashtra. Despite the setback, numbers favour the treasury benches with the BJP appearing determined to get Parliament's approval on its legislative agenda that was stonewalled in the Modi government's first term when opposition outnumbered it in the Upper House. The Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case favouring a Ram temple at the disputed site has also come has a boost to the saffron ranks. The government has listed Citizenship (amendment) Bill, a key BJP plank which is aimed at granting nationality to non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring countries, for passage in this session. The Modi government had introduced the bill in its previous tenure as well but could not push it through due to vehement protests by opposition parties, which criticised the bill as discriminatory on religious grounds. The legislation seeks to grant Indian citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan if they have fled their respective country due to religious persecution. There has been opposition to the bill in Assam and other Northeastern states, where most of these immigrants, mostly Hindus, have been living. The government also plans to seek Parliament's nod to two crucial ordinances. An ordinance reducing corporate tax rate for new and domestic manufacturing companies to arrest slowdown in the economy and boost growth was issued in September to give effect to amendments in the Income Tax Act, 1961 and Finance Act, 2019. The second ordinance, also issued in September, banned sale, manufacture and storage of e-cigarettes and similar products. This is the second Parliament session of the BJP-led NDA government which returned to power with a greater mandate in the recent Lok Sabha elections. During its first session, the government got Parliament's approval to key legislations like the bill to criminalise the practice of instant triple talaq and the other giving more powers to the National Investigation Agency. It was the most productive session in Lok Sabha since 1952 as 35 bills were passed. A total of 32 bills were cleared in Rajya Sabha. The two Houses also passed a resolution scrapping special status accorded to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcating the state into two union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. At another all-party meeting, which was convened by Speaker Om Birla on Saturday, the opposition said it will seek answers from the government on issues such as slowdown in economy, farmer distress, unemployment and situation in Jammu and Kashmir after its special status was scrapped in August. After the meeting, Modi had tweeted, ""We look forward to a productive Parliament session, where people-centric and development oriented issues would be discussed."" During the session, a special joint sitting of both the Houses has been planned to mark Constitution Day on November 26. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Harsh winter prompts J&amp;K administration to shift 34 detainees from Centaur hotel to MLA hostel | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: As Srinagar reeled under harsh winter conditions, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on Sunday shifted all 34 detainees lodged at Centaur Hotel since August 5, to the MLA Hostel as the facility lacked proper heating arrangements, officials said. The winter chill took a toll on the health of the detenues - National Conference, PDP and People's Conference leaders and prominent social activists - and the security personnel guarding them. They were lodged at the hotel on the bank of the scenic Dal Lake on August 5 when the central government announced its decision to abrogate Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and split the state into two Union territories. Kashmir Valley, including Srinagar city, was reeling under winter chill and witnessed the season's first snowfall earlier this month. The seat of administration in the newly created Union territory has moved from Srinagar to Jammu for the winter months. The administration carried out required modification of rooms in the MLA Hostel on Maulana Azad Road in the heart of the city to accommodate the political detainees It has been declared as a subsidiary jail by an order of the J&K home department. Among the political prisoners are Sajjad Lone of People's Conference (PC), Ali Mohammad Sagar of National Conference (NC), Naem Akhtar of the PDP and former IAS officer Shah Faesal. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti was on Friday shifted to a government accommodation in the city from a tourist hut located at the foothills of Zaberwan range, officials said. The move was necessitated as the approaching winters and frequent power cuts made it difficult to stay in the hut which was converted into a jail after she was detained on August 5 this year. According to the officials privy to the development, Centaur hotel, owned by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), has submitted a bill of nearly Rs 3 crore to the home department for over 100 days of boarding and lodging of the detainees. The administration has, however, rejected the claims of Centaur hotel and argued that the facility was converted into a subsidiary jail on August 5 and therefore, government rates would be paid. The rates sanctioned by the administration would be around Rs 800 per day as against Rs 5,000 charged by the hotel, the officials said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Govt should have paid as much attention to pollution as it did to Article 370: Sibal | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday hit out at the government over the pollution crisis in Delhi, saying the Centre should have paid as much attention to poor air quality as it did in dealing with Article 370.

 Pakistan’s J&amp;K narrative challenged at hearing | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: Arguing passionately that Kashmir is part of a 5000-year Indian civilization predating Islam and Pakistan, a Kashmir Hindu activist and writer told a US Congressional panel on Thursday that talk of India “occupying” Kashmir was absurd because Kashmir has always been a part of India. ""India is not just a 70-year-old identity, but a 5000-year-old civilisation. There is no India without Kashmir, and no Kashmir without India,"" the Houston-based activist Sunanda Vashisht testified at a hearing, challenging the largely Pakistan-driven narrative of the Kashmir issue as a 70-year old religion-specific territorial dispute. In searing personal testimony, Vashisht also pushed back against the ongoing narrative of Indian oppression and human rights abuse of Kashmiris, asking where were the advocates of human rights when Pakistan-backed terrorists indulged in targeting killing of Pandits in the 1990s and drove 400,000 them out of the Valley. “Where was the savior of humanity when my feeble old grandfather stood with kitchen knives and an old rusted axe ready to kill my mother and I in order to save us from the much worse fate that awaited us?” Vashisht asked the Democrat-dominated panel, which heard half-dozen lawmakers and five other witnesses narrate the familiar litany of human rights abuses by Indian forces with barely any acknowledgement of the proven terrorist training and infiltration that has been acknowledged by Pakistani leaders from Pervez Musharraf to Imran Khan. It was only the second time that the US Congress was hearing the Indian nationalist version of the Kashmir issue that centers on Pakistan’s effort to snatch a region that is civilisationally a part of India through terrorist infiltration and instigation of violence. Graphically relating the rape and bloodshed that Pandits had to endure in the pre-social media era before they were driven out, Vashisht told the panel that terrorists trained by Pakistan had caused ""ISIS level of horror and brutality"" in the Kashmir Valley long before the West was even introduced to the brutalities of radical Islamist terror. Although outnumbered in what she described as a lop-sided panel with all other witnessing wheeling out stories of “human rights abuses in Kashmir,” Vashisht got the opportunity to challenge several bogus assertions that have become part of the Kashmir narrative in the western and liberal circles. Kashmir, she said, was more than the small, narrow, Muslim dominated Valley that was seeing a Pakistani-terrorist driven insurgency; the people of Jammu and Ladakh, both part of the erstwhile state, for instance were happy with the scrapping of Article 370, which itself was conceived as a temporary measure. She also called out the bluff regarding a plebiscite/referendum frequently pressed for by Pakistani/Kashmiri Muslim/Western commentators, including some of her co-panelists, pointing out that the UN resolutions pertaining to that asked Pakistan to first withdraw from the area of Kashmir it has illegally occupied. “Good luck with that! And good luck with getting China to withdraw from the area of Kashmir it has occupied,” she sneered. Testimony from a slew of other witnesses, including Anurima Bhargava, the Indian-American Commissioner of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and a civil rights lawyer, centered on the usual litany of complaints about human rights abuses, including some established and acknowledged facts (such as curtailment of communications and the hardships on people) and some hyperbolic accounts, including reports of mass incarceration and genocide promoted by Pakistan. The half dozen lawmakers who dropped in during the hearing were largely sympathetic to the plight of the Kashmiri Muslims, and although some of them acknowledged Pakistan’s role in nurturing terrorists (euphemistically called militants) and fomenting unrest, they argued that this could not be an excuse for the Indian state’s heavyhandedness. Among those who excoriated New Delhi was Indian-American lawmaker Pramila Jayapal, who warned that New Delhi's action in Kashmir could be “harmful to our close and critical relationship.” A Congresswomen from Seattle area who was an Indian citizen for 35 years before she became a US national, Jayapal is one of several liberal lawmakers who sees the Kashmir issue from an ideological and civil liberties perspective that is driving the current narrative about Indian heavyhandedness and human rights abuse. Asked by the panel what was the way forward to address the issue, Vashisht sought the support of the the US and global community to stop the terrorist insurgency backed by Pakistan. ""India's democratic credentials are unmatched. The country has successfully, in a democratic setup, defeated insurgencies in Punjab and the northeast. It is time to strengthen India against such insurgencies and the human rights problems will be solved forever,"" she told the panel. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Modi has changed country's political culture: Nadda | India News - Times of India,"DEHRADUN: BJP national working president J P Nadda on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has transformed the country's political culture by bringing his own interpretation to the word ""power"". Attributing the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to Modi's political will and Amit Shah's strategy, Nadda said by uprooting a ""70-year-old cancer"" within a month of coming to power for a second term, the prime minister has shown how a strong government works. ""The Prime Minister has changed the country's political culture by giving a new meaning to the word power. For Narendra Modi power is not a means of enjoyment but a means to serve people,"" Nadda said addressing party booth presidents here during his first visit to the state after assuming office. He said Parliament which did not function smoothly for even five consecutive days earlier has increased its productivity by 128 per cent under Modi government. Under Modi, 100 bills were introduced in the Parliament and 40 of them were passed, Nadda said. He said abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 had paved the way for implementation of 106 central laws, including Prevention of Corruption and the Pocso acts in the state. Claiming that people in Jammu and Kashmir were happy with the defanging of Article 370, he said it was reflected in BJP's impressive performance in the Panchayat BDC polls in which it had won 81 out of 300 seats. It has also paved the way for political reservation for tribals in Jammu and Kashmir including Gujjar Bakarwals who can now be elected to legislatures including Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, Nadda said. On the growing strength of the BJP, he said it had rewritten its own record of being the largest party in the world with 17 crore members. ""Within just 54 days we have broken our own record by adding 6 crore more members and increasing our strength from 11 crore to 17 crore,"" he said. Nadda said out of 59 political parties recognised by the Election Commission, BJP is the only party which has true internal democracy. ""We are the only party which does not suffer from the family syndrome. It is not run by the homes of leaders but by the power of our workers,"" he said.

 Hand over 'wanted Indians' living in Pakistan if serious about better ties with India: Jaishankar to Islamabad | India News - Times of India,"LONDON: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has said relations with Pakistan remain ""difficult"" because it openly practices terrorism against India, and if Islamabad is serious to cooperate with New Delhi, it should hand over the Indians wanted for terrorist activities living in Pakistan. In a wide-ranging interview with French daily Le Monde, the minister said Pakistan does not deny sending terrorists to India. ""The relationship is difficult since many years, mainly because Pakistan has developed an important terrorist industry and sends terrorists to India to carry out attacks. Pakistan itself does not deny this situation,"" he said, in response to a question about Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's recent statement that relations with India are ""close to zero"". Willingness to cooperate on terrorism precondition for talks with Pakistan: S Jaishankar""Now, tell me which country would be willing to talk and negotiate with a neighbour who openly practices terrorism against it ... We need actions that demonstrate a real willingness to cooperate. ""For example, there are Indians wanted for terrorist activities living in Pakistan. We are telling Pakistan: Hand them over to us,"" he said, in a clear reference to criminals like underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, who is believed to be hiding in Pakistan. Simla agreement resulted in 'revanchist' Pakistan, problems in Jammu and Kashmir: S JaishankarDawood, originally from Dongri in Mumbai, is wanted for murder, extortion, targeted killing, drug trafficking, terrorism and various other cases. His name figured in the United Nations Security Council's updated list of terrorists and militant groups in 2018. On the situation in Kashmir, Jaishankar said the ""reforms"" in August, when India revoked Article 370 to withdraw the special status of the region, led to some precautionary measures to avert the danger of violent reactions from radical and separatist elements but that the situation was now returning to normal. ""These restrictions have been gradually reduced, and as the situation normalises, telephone and mobile lines have been restored, shops are open and apple harvest is under way. The situation is back to normal,"" he said, adding that foreign journalists would be welcome to the region as soon as things are safe. Asked about the tide of ""nationalism"" in India, Jaishankar reiterated that India's nationalism should not be viewed through western lens. ""Each country has a different understanding of nationalism, a different history. In the United States, it has an isolationist connotation. In Asia, at least in India, nationalism is a positive word,"" he said. On a question related to tensions arising out of nationalism for minorities, he reiterated: ""It is my country that defines my nationality, not my religion, nor my caste, nor my language. ""The concept of nation is different. In India, we are in a sense a civilization state, with natural, linguistic, ethnic and religious diversity. We have never considered uniformity as a necessity or an aspiration. There are few places in the world where you will see so many people with so many beliefs co-existing."" In the interview which covered a wide spectrum of topics, from India-China relations to the India-US dynamic, the external affairs minister was categorical about India's growing importance in a world where power will be more dispersed across a range of actors. ""We are in a completely different world. We tend to consider the post-1945 bipolar world and the post-1992 American world as the norm. But look at the history of the world. Things change, nothing is engraved in stone. This world will be different, power will be more dispersed, there will be more actors,"" he said. Asked if Europe would be one such actor, he noted that India would be in favour of that. ""We are a deeply democratic country … in a democratic world, Europe must have a greater role,"" he said. On India and China, the minister said that both countries shared a common interest in making the world more inclusive and a re-balancing of the world requires re-balancing with Asia, and in Asia, which covers primarily with India and China. ""We are two great countries and it is in our common interest to have good relationships,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" Take effective, decisive action against urban Naxalites, terrorists in Kashmir: Amit Shah to CRPF | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah directed the CRPF to undertake ""effective and decisive action"" against urban Naxalites as well as terrorists operating in Jammu and Kashmir as he made his maiden visit to the headquarters of the paramilitary force here on Friday, officials said. He reviewed the overall preparedness and deployment of the over three-lakh-strong force during the more-than-two-hour-long meeting at the CGO Complex on Lodhi Road, they said. Shah directed the force ""to carry out an effective and decisive campaign against Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) operatives in the next six months"", they said. He also asked the force to take action ""against urban Naxalites and their facilitators"", they said. While discussing the security scenario in the newly created Union Territory of Jammu-Kashmir, Shah asked the CRPF to undertake civic action programmes besides organising sports and tours for locals and youngsters. CRPF should also reach out to the villagers and assist them in obtaining the benefits of the many central schemes which they are eligible for, the officials said. The minister directed the force to ensure ""proper winter provisioning"" for the troops and that their welfare should be looked after. The force, post the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, has sent in additional troops and has over 1 lakh personnel in the Valley at present. Officials said the requirement of infrastructure and equipment was also discussed during the meeting and a presentation was made by senior CRPF officers including Director General R R Bhatnagar. While reviewing the Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) theatre, they said, the minister talked about improving infrastructure of the force camps and measures against improvised explosive devices. Shah emphasised that road connectivity and medical infrastructure in LWE areas should be upgraded. Subject of welfare of the troops was also part of the discussions and the minister directed that the health of the jawans and their families should be looked after well. He asked the force to ensure that jawans and their families have digital health-cards and that there should be periodical health checks for their families. The minister directed that senior officers should visit the families of personnel who were killed in the line of duty and spend time with them understanding their requirements, they said. A database should also be made of the martyrs families and their basic issues and grievances should be systematically addressed, Shah told the CRPF officials. The minister expressed concern about the hard and long deployment of jawans in difficult theatres and discussed various measures for giving them relief and an opportunity to stay with their families. Shah, the officials said, directed that the building and residential infrastructure of the force should be improved and more houses at different duty locations of CRPF should be constructed. Cutting-edge technologies and state-of-the-art equipment should be identified which are required for operational purposes along with promoting the 'Make in India' initiative. He asked that the force should use Khadi and indigenously made products, they said. The minister also posted some photographs of the visit on his official Twitter handle and said the country is proud of the ""exemplary valour"" of the paramilitary force's personnel. The Central Reserve Police Force is designated as the lead force for internal security duties and anti-naxal operations. ""CRPF personnel have always lived up to their motto of 'sewa' and 'nishtha' (service and dedication) by protecting our nation (while posted) at different terrains. I salute the courage and bravery of CRPF personnel and their families,"" Shah said in a tweet. During the initial part of the visit, Shah paid tributes to the force personnel killed in the line of duty and put a garland around an urn containing the soil from the 'Sardar Post' in Gujarat's Rann of Kutch. The urn is kept at the headquarter's entrance. In 1965, the force was tasked to secure the post in the wake of aggressive posturing by Pakistan. On the intervening night of April 8 and 9 that year, 3,500 men of Pakistan's 51st Infantry Brigade, comprising the 18 Punjab Battalion, the 8 Frontier Rifles and the 6 Baluch Battalion, stealthily launched simultaneous assaults on the Sardar and Tak posts under an operation code-named ""Desert Hawk"". The retaliation by the CRPF saw the numerically and armament superior Pakistan army retreating and leaving behind 34 bodies of their soldiers, including those of two officers. Shah said the young generation should be made aware about this story of valour. The country will be ""forever indebted"" to the troops who made the supreme sacrifice, the minister said. This was the first time Shah, who became home minister in the Modi government's second term, visited the head office of the country's largest paramilitary force.

 Pakistan's neurotic behaviour declined it to a failed state with 'DNA of terrorism': India | India News - Times of India,"PARIS: India has lashed out at Pakistan over its ""juvenile propaganda"" on its internal affairs, saying its neurotic behaviour has resulted in the country's decline to a nearly failed state with radicalised society and deep-rooted ""DNA of terrorism"".

""We take this chair to refute Pakistan's juvenile propaganda to malign India through fabricated lies, full of deceit and deception,"" Agarwal, who is currently posted as a delegate to Unesco, said while exercising India's right to reply on Thursday. ""We condemn the unwarranted comments made by Pakistan on the judgment made by the Supreme Court of India. The judgment is about the rule of law, equal respect for all faiths, concepts that are alien to Pakistan and its ethos,"" she said on Pakistan's remarks on the Ayodhya verdict. India's statement comes after Pakistan's education minister Shafqat Mahmood expressed disappointment at the Supreme Court's decision on the Babri Mosque saying it was not in line with Unesco's values of religious freedom. ""Pakistan's neurotic behaviour has resulted in its decline to a nearly failed state with its weak economy, radicalised society and deep-rooted DNA of terrorism,"" she said. Agarwal also reiterated the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity over the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Pakistan is home to all shades of darkness; from extremist ideologies and darker powers of radicalisation to the darkest manifestations of terrorism, she said while pointing out to a statement by former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf who described terrorists like Osama bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri as ""our heroes"". Agarwal said that Pakistan has been engaging into such diabolic rhetoric to malign India in front of the international community irrespective of the deplorable conditions of human rights suffered by the minority community on its own soil. Relations between India and Pakistan touched a new low after the Indian government on August 5 revoked the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and its bifurcation into two Union Territories.

 Better to keep '3 persons' in detention if Kashmir remains peaceful: Jitendra Singh to officers | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: The three former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers should remain in detention if it helps in maintaining peace in the Valley, Union minister Jitendra Singh on Friday told a group of officers who briefed him about the situation in the newly created Union territory. He said the government has to change the narrative on Jammu and Kashmir in a bid to have good governance and development in the region with a focus on the youth. Referring to the detention of former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, Singh said, ""If the situation is peaceful, because they are detained, then it is better that they remain detained."" He was addressing the officers after inaugurating a two-day regional conference here, which will focus on the implementation of good governance practices in the region. The regional conference, which is being organised on the theme of ""replication of good governance practices in the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh"", also witnessed the presence of LG Girish Chandra Murmu. Singh said the narrative on Jammu and Kashmir has to change so that the fruits of good governance and development reach to the people. ""There is a section of people who don't know what they have been deprived of. The deprivation happened to that extent,"" he said. ""We have a new dispensation and new order reporting directly to the Centre and we owe it to the people of this region to cooperate with them and make it successful,"" the minister said. ""We owe it to youth because they comprise 70 per cent of the population. They have deprived of enormous opportunities that were unfolded by the Modi government in the last five years. Aspiration of the youth is litmus test for us"", he said. Mainstream leaders, including the three former chief ministers, were taken into preventive custody in the wake of the Centre's decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5.

" Situation in J&amp;K getting normal, detained leaders will be released but no time-frame: Home ministry to parliamentary panel | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Top Union home ministry officials on Friday conveyed to a parliamentary panel that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is getting normal and detained political leaders, including former chief ministers, will be released but gave no time-frame for it, sources said. Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and additional secretary in the home ministry Gyanesh Kumar and other ministry officials briefed the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs, chaired by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma, on the situation in the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha quizzed top government officials on the detention of political leaders, particularly three-time former chief minister and Srinagar MP Farooq Abdullah, who was charged under the controversial Public Safety Act on September 17. Home ministry officials told the parliamentary panel that those detained under the PSA can challenge their detention in a designated tribunal. If not satisfied with the order of the tribunal, they can move the high Court. Abdullah is the only political leader detained under the PSA in Kashmir. Sources said the MPs were also agitated about the prolonged detention of Abdullah's son Omar Abdullah as well as PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, both former chief ministers, who have been under detention since August 5, when the Centre withdrew Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 and bifurcated it into two union territories. Responding to questions on the release of the detained political leaders, Bhalla and his team of officers conveyed that some had been released and others will be freed gradually but refrained from giving any time line, sources said. The home secretary, sources said, told the MPs that the situation in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir is getting normal, schools are open and the apple trade is going on, sources said. The MPs also raised the issue of curbs on the internet in the Valley since August 5. Home ministry officials, it is learnt, said the restrictions were imposed as the internet could be used by terrorists for subversive activities as well as by anti-social elements to spread rumours. The parliamentarians were told that there were 71,254 incidents of terror-related violence in Jammu and Kashmir since 1990 in which 14,049 civilians, 5,293 security personnel and 22,552 terrorists were killed. Home ministry officials also told the members that all Central laws have become applicable to the new UTs, state laws overlapping with Central laws stand repealed and remaining state laws brought in line with the Constitution of India. The new political map of India depicting the two new UTs -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, which includes Pakistan occupied Kashmir and its so-called capital Muzaffarabad and Gilgit-Baltistan -- was shown to the MPs during a presentation. The new UT of Jammu and Kashmir has 22 districts with a population of approximately 122 lakh and there are two districts in UT of Ladakh -- Kargil and Leh, home ministry officials said in their presentation. They also said all landline services, postpaid mobile voice phone services have been restored in both UTs and restrictions under Section 144 on movement withdrawn or relaxed, except for night time restrictions in the Valley. According to sources present at the meeting, differences between the BJP and the Congress MPs cropped up over the issue of Jammu and Kashmir being discussed in the panel. While BJP members cited the rule book to say the panel should not interfere in the work of the executive, Congress MPs said the issue was important and had to be discussed, the sources said.

 Willingness to cooperate on terrorism precondition for talks with Pakistan: S Jaishankar | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday said that actions demonstrating a real willingness to cooperate on terrorism remain a precondition for the resumption of talks with Pakistan. Responding to a question during an interview with Le Monde newspaper seeking his assessment on where New Delhi's relations with Islamabad stand, Jaishankar said, ""The relationship is difficult since many years, mainly because Pakistan has developed an important terrorist industry and sends terrorists to India to carry out attacks. Pakistan itself does not deny this situation."" ""Now, tell me: which country would be willing to talk and negotiate with a neighbour who openly practices terrorism against it? If one of your neighbours did, would you, France, pretend that everything is fine? We need actions that demonstrate a real willingness to cooperate. For example, there are Indians wanted for terrorist activities living in Pakistan. We are telling Pakistan: hand them over to us,"" Jaishankar added, as cited in a transcript of the interview released by the Ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Friday. Relations between India and Pakistan touched a new low after the Indian government on August 5 abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

This was conveyed to members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on home affairs by senior officials led by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla. An advisory committee has been constituted under Section 84 of the J&K Reorganisation Act for apportionments of assets, rights and liabilities between UT of J&K and Ladakh, Bhall and his team of officers told the committee headed by Congress leader Anand Sharma.

As per Section 84 of the Act, the assets and liabilities of the existing state of Jammu and Kashmir have to be apportioned between the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. On August 5, the Centre announced the abrogation of the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and division of the state into the two UTs. The apportionment of the assets and liabilities of the existing state of Jammu and Kashmir shall be subject to the recommendations of a committee constituted by the central government, it said.

At a meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, headed by Congress leader Anand Sharma, the MPs quizzed Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and his team of officials on the prevailing situation in Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, and the steps taken to bring back normalcy there. This was for the first time that the meeting of the committee was held since August 5, when the central government abrogated the special status given to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and divided it into two Union territories. The home secretary conveyed to the MPs that situation in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir is getting normal, schools have been opened, while apple trading is going on, sources said. Asked specifically about the release of detained political leaders, Bhalla and his team of officers said they are being released gradually but no time-frame about when the rest will be freed could be given, sources said.

Twitter trolls Pak's Tech minister over decision to provide internet in Kashmir - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: The Twitteratti on Thursday trolled Pakistan's Science and Technology minister Fawad Hussain Chaudhry for his decision to provide internet to people of Kashmir. ""Internet is considered a fundamental right nowadays..."" Chaudhry announced on Twitter. The minister said that in order to ensure the full provision of the facility, he has also reached out to Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), an executive and national space agency of the Government of Pakistan and a bilateral organisation of China National Space Administration, responsible for the nation's public and civil space programme and for aeronautics and aerospace research. ""Please don't play game of satellite war.. It would be worst for Pakistan. .. Hahahah,"" a Twitter user said. ""And people are congratulating him for providing internet via satellite this is what is naya Pakistan.. And he is science and tech minister,"" said another. ""Is he technology minister?"" a third tweeted. Internet has been suspended in Kashmir since the Centre abrogated Article 370 and Article 35(A), earlier in August that granted special powers to Jammu and Kashmir and passed the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganisation) Act 2019, bifurcating the former state into two Union Territories - Jammu and Kashmir with legislature and Ladakh without one. The government had time and again reiterated that restrictions on mobile services were imposed in the Valley to prevent misuse of these services for flaring tensions. The then governor Satya Pal Malik had said that the curb has been imposed as these facilities were abused as a weapon against the country and mostly exploited by terrorists to mobilise the people. But this was not the end. It should be noted that the minister had misspelled the name of SUPARCO as 'SPRACO' that further added fuel to him being shamed on social media. In addition, Chaudhry, in his tweet, also referred to the people of Jammu and Kashmir as 'caged citizens'. The tweet comes at a time when the minority communities in Pakistan has been suffering blatant human rights atrocities, enforced disappearances, fake encounters and extra-judicial killings at the hands of the military establishment of the country. It is also worth noting that the country which is surviving on loans and bailout facilities from the global money lenders, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to facilitate its plunging economy is claiming to punch above its weight.

Hindu American Foundation writes to Tom Lantos panel on Kashmir - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The HinduAmerican Foundation (HAF) has urged the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission to recognize ""the unique security challenges faced by America's ally India in Jammu and Kashmir and forcefully address Pakistan's role as a state sponsor of terror"". The HAF, a non-profit advocacy organization for the HinduAmerican community, in a written statement to the Lantos Commission on Thursday also urged the US government to ""fully support India's internal sovereign decisions"". It joined the Indo- American Kashmir Forum and Kashmir Hindu Foundation and submitted a Written Statement for the Record to the Commission as it held its hearing, ""Jammu and Kashmir in Context"" on Thursday. It also said that the US State Department should ""continue to engage with the Indian government on a road map towards restoring normalcy and lifting of restrictions as soon as is reasonably possible"". ""The US should hold Pakistan accountable for its support of cross-border terrorism and its persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, including Kashmiris, so that peace is restored in Kashmir once and for all. ""Finally, the US government should support the human rights of the ethnically cleansed Kashmiri Hindu population and other Kashmiris who have been victimized by Pakistani sponsored terror groups,"" it added. The HAF expressed disappointment with the Commission for holding the hearing with a very short public notice of only 48 hours. It said a conventional advance notice of two weeks or more would have elicited a far wider response from potential expert witnesses, non-government organisations working in this field, as well as the wider public, thus enriching the Commission's fact-finding spirit. ""Furthermore, it is disappointing to see this hearing being held on the same day that Diwali, the most important festival for over 3 million Indian Americans, is being celebrated on Capitol Hill. ""Such insensitivity is not lost on the Indian American community,"" it added. On the August 5 revocation of special status for Jammu and Kashmir, it said: ""For decades, these temporary and discriminatory provisions (Article 370 and Article 35A) had a number of unintended consequences. Article 370 restricted the Indian Parliament's legislative power over Jammu and Kashmir to defence, foreign affairs, and communications, forcing residents of Jammu and Kashmir to live under a separate set of laws that prevented them from enjoying the same rights as other Indian citizens. ""Similarly, Article 35A defined who were permanent residents of the state and determined who could buy property in the state and enjoy other special rights and privileges. ""The repeal of these articles ensures that all democratic laws passed in the Indian Parliament are applied to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, ensuring equal protection under the law and all the rights afforded to Indian citizens, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, religion, or social background, and whom now have access to better educational and economic opportunities."" On the Kashmir situation, it said: ""The situation in Jammu and Kashmir today is a direct product of cross-border terrorism from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Pakistan's actions in Kashmir have not just been limited to overt military conflict, but have also included the use of proxies. Starting in 1989, Pakistan's military and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency started a full-blown proxy war. This is the same military-intelligence complex that provided safe harbour to Osama Bin Laden and Islamist terrorists that continue to attack US forces in Afghanistan today. ""In 1989-1990, over 350,000 Kashmiri Hindus, known as Pandits, were ethnically cleansed from the Kashmir Valley, their ancestral home. The violent campaign targeting Kashmir's indigenous minorities was organised, systematic, and included massacres, rape, threats, and intimidation. Public announcements were placed in newspapers, intimidating sermons were made in mosques and broadcast on loudspeakers, and posters hung on houses ordering all Kashmiri Hindus to leave the Valley, threatening violence if they did not and calling on Muslims to take up jihad against non-Muslims. This episode resulted in the cleansing of approximately 95% of the indigenous Hindu population. ""While religious minorities in Kashmir were specifically targeted, Kashmiri Muslims have by far bore the brunt of terrorist related violence, which has taken the lives of 15,000 civilians, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal. Pakistan sponsored terror groups active in Kashmir, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen and Jaish-e-Mohammed are designated as Foreign Terrorist Organisations by the US State Department and enjoy links with the broader terror network in South Asia, including the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and IS.

 India braces for more US scrutiny on Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: India is bracing itself for another withering scrutiny and shellacking over the human rights situation in the Kashmir Valley. A Congressional panel is scheduled to hold a hearing on Thursday afternoon (Friday 12:30 am IST) with expert testimony on the issue, the second in space of a month following the October 22 hearing in which Democrats and liberal lawmakers hauled New Delhi over the coals. Drawing lessons from the episode, Indian diplomats have worked hard to press for a fair hearing in which they hope the narrative takes into account the establishment version of the situation and how it came to be. In fact, the notification from the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission announcing the event is headlined “Jammu and Kashmir in Context.” It says the hearing will “examine the human rights situation in the former state of Jammu and Kashmir in India in historical and national context.” Still, testimonies are expected to be loaded against the Indian establishment narrative in a Congress that is Democrat-controlled and before a panel whose agenda it is to examine human rights issues. The panel was instituted to honour a late lawmaker who was the only holocaust survivor to serve in the US Congress and was an ardent human rights activist, Hungarian-American Tom Lantos. Witnesses slated to testify before the ten-member panel include Anurima Bhargava, a civil rights lawyer who is currently the Commissioner of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom; Haley Duschinski, an Associate Professor of Anthropology and Director of the Center for Law, Justice and Culture at Ohio University, Sehla Ashai, Human rights lawyer; Yousra Fazili, Human rights lawyer who is said to be a Kashmiri-American cousin of Mubeen Shah, a detained Kashmiri businessman; and Arjun S. Sethi, Human rights lawyer and Adjunct Professor, Georgetown Law, who is also a trenchant social media critic of the Indian government; and John Sifton, Asia Advocacy Director, Human Rights Watch. The lone voice presenting the Hindu Indian perspective will be that of Sunanda Vashisht whom the panel describes as a writer, political commentator, and a ""Kashmiri Hindu who identifies as a victim of ethnic cleansing.” In the weeks leading up to Congressional attention and scrutiny on the situation in the Kashmir Valley, Indian officials have argued before lawmakers and and their staffers that the right to live safely from terror in the Kashmir Valley is more important than temporary suspension of communications, including internet and mobile telephony, which they say is prone to be misused by terrorist elements. They have also argued that thanks to government measures, there are fewer deaths -- almost none -- in the Kashmir Valley compared to hundreds in other hotspots across the world where unrest and insurgencies are raging. In fact, none of Pakistan's histrionic accounts of genocide, mass killings etc have been realised in the Valley. The presentation has had some impact. For instance, the Lantos panel, while noting that the increased militarization of the security presence in the region and the economic and social consequences of the central government’s actions, including continuing restrictions on internet and phones, have also provoked widespread concern, also pointed out that ""militants have targeted migrant workers from outside Kashmir, and have threatened businesses to maintain a protest shutdown."" In 2018 the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented human rights violations in BOTH India- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir and issued recommendations on a wide range of issues including civilian killings, deaths during security operations, blanket restrictions on journalists and independent observers, misuse of anti-terrorism legislation, and protection of religious minorities, the Panel noted. Nor are the human rights problems limited to the Kashmir region, it added, pointing out that patterns of human rights violations have been documented at the national level in India and Pakistan, including by the US Department of State in the annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. Still, some Indian activists are unhappy that the government has failed to hold Pakistan to account and bring it to book -- and the US Congress has failed to punish it -- for terrorist depredations that are publicly confirmed by its leaders ranging from Imran Khan to Pervez Musharraf, who speak openly of having trained terrorists, including for the purpose of wresting Kashmir from India.

" LG says poll process in J&amp;K to begin soon, asks cops to be ready for key role | India News - Times of India","JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Girish Chandra Murmu on Thursday said that the election process in the newly-created Union Territory would begin soon. “It will not continue like this,” Murmu said, adding, “The process for holding the elections will come soon.” The Centre had on August 5 revoked the special status to Jammu and Kashmir by nullifying Article 370 and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. J&K is a Union Territory with an assembly, but not Ladakh. At a police function in Reasi district, about 70km from Jammu, Murmu said there would be an “important role” for the men in uniform in the forthcoming elections. “Elections will come. It is a Union Territory with a legislature,” he said. He was the chief guest of the passing-out parade of the 14th batch of constables of Jammu and Kashmir Police, comprising 1,155 recruits. Praising the J&K Police, Murmu said the force had fought the challenge of terrorism boldly. “The jawans should serve the people with utmost devotion and dedication. The Jammu and Kashmir Police have made huge sacrifices.” Addressing the police personnel, DGP Dilbag Singh said terrorism “was on its last legs” because of the sacrifices made by J&K policemen. “The J&K police achieved a lot on several fronts.

The court said it would start final hearing on the batch of petitions from December 10. Senior advocates Rajeev Dhavan and Raju Ramachandaran, appearing for the petitioners, pleaded that an interim order was needed as the process for division of assets and bifurcation of services had started.

" Simla agreement resulted in 'revanchist' Pakistan, problems in Jammu and Kashmir: S Jaishankar | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Asserting that past handling of Pakistan raises many questions, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said the 1972 Simla agreement resulted in a ""revanchist"" Pakistan and continuing problems in Jammu and Kashmir. He hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""bold moves"" in dealing with the neighbouring country. The minister also said that ""holding the feet to the fire"" is very important in dealing with Pakistan and asserted the neighbouring country has built ""an industry of terror"". Delivering the fourth Ramnath Goenka memorial lecture, Jaishankar advocated a foreign policy that appreciates change and is not status quoist as he cited key past incidents in Indian history such as the defeat in the war with China in 1962, the Simla agreement, the ""inaction"" after the Mumbai terror attacks to contrast it with India's more dynamic stance post-2014. Giving a historical perspective to geopolitical issues, Jaishankar said, ""For years India's position on the world stage seemed assured, but the 1962 conflict with China significantly damaged India's standing."" ""India's record includes dark moments like the 1962 defeat against China. Or tense ones like the 1965 war with Pakistan. There are enough dichotomies in our past to generate a spirited debate on successes and failures,"" the minister said. ""Two decades of nuclear indecision ended dramatically with the tests of 1998. The lack of response to 26/11 is so different from the Uri and Balakot operations. Whether it is events or trends, they all bear scrutiny for the lessons they hold,"" he said. Jaishankar asserted that the purposeful pursuit of national interest in shifting global dynamics may not be easy, but it must be done. The real obstacle to the rise of India is not anymore the barriers of the world, but the dogmas of Delhi, he said in his lecture on the topic 'Beyond the Delhi Dogma: Indian Foreign Policy in a Changing World'. ""There was also little awareness in the 1950s that we were dealing with a battle-hardened neighbour to the North. Or of the strategic significance of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This approach to world affairs continued even thereafter,"" Jaishankar said while explaining six phases in Indian foreign policy. ""Thus, in 1972 at Shimla, India chose to bet on an optimistic outlook on Pakistan. At the end of the day, it resulted in both a revanchist Pakistan and a continuing problem in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. The Simla agreement was signed by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistan President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1972 seeking to reverse the consequences of the 1971 war. It was a comprehensive blue print for good neighbourly relations between India and Pakistan. The external affairs minister said the time taken to link talks with Pakistan to cessation of terrorism speaks for itself. After the lecture, Jaishankar also engaged in a conversation on stage and took several questions on neighbourhood policy, Pakistan, Indo-US ties and abrogation of Article 370 provisions and bifurcation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Speaking on the government's move to abrogate Jammu and Kashmir's special status, Jaishankar said the discussions around it were ideological and there was ""liberal fundamentalism at work"" in the discourse. ""My reputation is not decided by a newspaper in New York,"" Jaishankar said over criticism of the government's move by foreign media. ""As we move decisively to combat separatism in Jammu and Kashmir, there is some talk of its internationalization and hyphenation of our ties with Pakistan. This is thinking from the past, reflecting neither the strength of India, the mood of the nation or the determination of the government,"" he asserted in the lecture. Uninformed comments abroad on India's internal affairs is hardly internationalization, Jaishankar said. ""The reputational and real differences between India and Pakistan puts paid to any hyphenation effort. In reality, these fears are but a thinly disguised advocacy of inaction. Their intent, conscious or otherwise, is to legitimize a status quo that has now been overtaken by history,"" he said. Jaishankar also hit out at the handling of Pakistan in the past, saying it raises many questions. ""Our past handling of Pakistan, a society which we are supposed to know well, also raises many questions. These are not exactly hypothetical situations and are cited to underline the contention that emergence as a leading power requires great pragmatism,"" he said. ""That can be further strengthened by more sophisticated narratives that help reconcile divergences. After all, our emphasis on sovereignty has not prevented us from responding to human rights situations in our immediate region,"" he said. India had allowed the narrative to focus mainly on a dialogue with Pakistan, when the real issue was stopping crossborder terrorism, Jaishankar asserted. In the last five years, however, a different normal has developed and global conversations on crossborder terrorism have become more serious, he said. Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his ""bold moves"" in dealing with Pakistan, Jaishankar said his visit to Pakistan was ""extraordinarily"" risky, not just politically but also physically. Jaishankar also cited the FATF pressure on Pakistan over terror activities emanating from its soil and said India needs bold moves to deal with the neighbouring country. On the economic slowdown in India, Jaishankar said, ""We shouldn't be so faint-hearted. Two-quarter slowdown doesn't mean the world is coming to an end. We have been through that before.""

 BJP should accept Sabarimala like they accepted Ayodhya ruling: Digvijaya Singh | India News - Times of India,"BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said on Thursday that the RSS and the BJP should accept the Supreme Court's decision in the Sabarimala temple case just as they did in the Ayodhya matter. He was reacting to the apex court's decision to refer the Sabarimala and similar religious issues to a larger bench. ""Our party has always been of the opinion that the court should decide issues like Ayodhya dispute.I am happy that all parties accepted the SC decision on this (Ayodhya) issue,"" he said. ""The BJP and RSS should learn from this. All should accept the verdict of Sabarimala too, like the SC decision on Ayodhya,"" the Congress leader added. The Supreme Court on Thursday said a larger seven- judge bench will re-examine various religious issues, including the entry of women of all ages into the Sabarimala temple. Earlier, addressing party leaders at state Congress headquarters Indira Bhawan at a program to mark the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, Singh said history is being rewritten by the current regime in the country. ""India's history is being changed and the image of our freedom fighters is being tarnished,"" Singh said, asking Congress leaders to fight against this by educating children about the country's history and freedom fighters. He also lamented that ""more than half the Congressmen don't know about what Article 370 is"". ""They are saying that Centre did a good job (by abrogating its provisions). What good job? Kashmir is slipping out of hand. If we want Kashmir then we will have to keep Kashmiri people with us,"" he told the gathering.

Maharashtra elections 2019: Amit Shah predicts wipeout for Congress-NCP in Maharashtra | India News - Times of India,"SHIRUR: After offering prayers at Ambabai temple in Kolhapur and as chants of ‘Jai Bhawani-Jai Shivaji’ rent the air, home minister Amit Shah sets off on another round of campaigning for the Maharashtra elections, predicting that the end of opposition NCP-Congress is near. Shah exudes confidence that BJP will maintain its winning streak and Devendra Fadnavis will return for a second term as CM as he recalled the “misrule” during the Congress-NCP alliance government and looks to emphasise his party’s nationalist credentials. Addressing a rally in Karad, Shah questioned Congress’s apprehensions about steps taken by the Modi government on national security: “There could not be a bigger irony that the Congress did nothing for national security and when Modi government is taking measures, the opposition party is questioning them,” Shah said, getting a round of applause from the crowd. Though this is a state poll, national issues have figured prominently in speeches with ruling party frequently underlining the decisive and firm leadership of Prime Minister and steps taken by his government like the nullification of Article 370 and Article 35A subsequent to the resounding verdict in Modi’s favour in the Lok Sabha polls. Amit Shah indisposed, skips poll rallies in Haryana“BJP won more than 300 seats in the recent Lok Sabha polls after which Prime Minister Modi removed Article 370 and incorporated Kashmir with the country’s mainstream,” Shah said at Kolhapur. In Shirur assembly constituency of Pune district Shah was on a roadshow, the first in the current Maharashtra polls. During the roadshow, Republican Party flags were seen with the BJP, but not that of ally Shiv Sena. BJP and Sena are contesting the polls as allies but the ongoing campaign has seen the two treading cautiously with the regional ally appearing wary after being forced to play second fiddle bagging lesser seats in the seat sharing arrangements. Sena has already come out with its own manifesto and BJP is likely to release its own soon. In campaigns, posters and banners, the two allies are rarely mentioned together. Shah, however, spoke of the strength of the alliance drawing a comparison between contestants spearheading the challenge. “There are two options for people of Maharashtra; On the one hand there are Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray and on the other side are Rahul Baba and Sharad Pawar. People of the state have to choose between them!” Shah says. The BJP chief attacked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying, “Through air strike, PM Modi destroyed terror camps and killed terrorists but Rahul Gandhi accused PM of “khoon ki dalali”. Urging people to vote for BJP, Shah said the “double-decker” governments (Centre and state) have already delivered for the state and another mandate was needed to maintain the momentum.

However, the shops open only for few hours in the morning in downtown (old city) areas, they added. The markets across the valley had been following a new pattern of functioning, opening early morning till around noon and then closing to join the protest against abrogation of the special status of the state. The officials said miscreants and militants were using fear mongering to put down any resistance to unannounced shutdown by threatening shopkeepers and businessmen. The officials said two grenade attacks in the city's busy Goni Khan market and Kaka Sarai areas recently and killing of a shopkeeper in Tral area of south Kashmir's Pulwama distirct on Wednesday were an indication that there were concerted efforts to keep the shutdown going. Efforts of the state government to open schools have not borne any fruit as parents continued to keep children at home due to apprehensions about their safety. However, the board examinations for class 10 and Class 12 are going on as per schedule. Internet services across all platforms continued to be suspended in Kashmir for the 102nd day on Thursday. The authorities snapped all communication lines - landline telephone and mobile phone services and internet across all platforms -- on August 5, hours before the Centre announced its decision to abrogate Article 370 and to bifurcate the erstwhile state into two Union territories. While landline telephones were gradually restored, postpaid mobile services resumed later. However, prepaid mobile and internet services are yet to be resumed. Most of the top level and second rung separatist politicians have been taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders including two former chief ministers -- Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti -- have been either detained or placed under house arrest.

Few mini-buses also plied on the Batwara-Batamaloo route through the city centre, while inter-district cabs and auto-rickshaws plied in the city and elsewhere in the valley. Private transport was plying unhindered. A railway official told PTI that a train chugged between Baramulla and Srinagar this morning. He said the train made only two trips on the Baramulla-Srinagar stretch as authorities have directed Railways to ply trains between 10 am and 3 pm only due to security reasons. The Railways conducted the trial run of the service on the stretch on Monday for the first time in over three months since the unannounced shutdown in the valley. The official said the Srinagar-Banihal stretch of the railway line would resume in a few days after checking track safety and conducting trial runs. The train service in the Valley was suspended due to security reasons on the morning of 5 August – hours before the Centre announced its decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and to bifurcate the erstwhile state into two Union territories. The Centre's decision led to an unannounced shutdown in the Valley – which completed 100 days on Tuesday – even as authorities imposed severe restrictions which were later gradually eased out. Markets have been following a new pattern of functioning, opening early morning till around the noon and then downing their shutters to join the protest against abrogation of the special status of the state, officials said.

 President used Article 370 power six times before August 5: Govt | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the decision to scrap “special status” of J&K was Constitution-compliant and was taken in the interest of the nation’s security. It has expressed surprise that the validity of the August 5 move has been questioned when six earlier instances of the use of Article 370(1) (d) while the assembly was not in existence attracted no legal challenge. In its affidavit responding to a bunch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the August 5 move, the Centre has said the decision was taken following the constitutionally-mandated process as the regime that had existed under Article 370 was “impeding full integration of erstwhile state of J&K with the rest of the country...” Addressing the issue of its use of Article 370(I) (d) without the concurrence of J&K assembly to do away with the “special status” for the strategically significant state, it has pointed out that the President had exercised the very same provision that was used on August 5 six times in the past, without anyone challenging such exercise of power. “It may be worth noting that the power under Article 370(1)(d) was exercised by President of India on as many as six occasions when President’s Rule was in force in Jammu and Kashmir. At no time was any issue/challenge ever raised against the exercise of this power on the ground that the Legislative Assembly of J&K or the state government of J&K were not in existence as the said exercise of power is valid, lawful and constitutional exercise,” the home ministry said. In an affidavit responding to a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of exercise of power under Article 370(1)(d) by the President to alter the status of erstwhile state of J&K as well as Parliament’s decision to divide the state into two Union Territories, the ministry said, “There had been three amendments till August 4, 2019 in Article 370 of the Constitution, which were modified in the past in exercise of powers under Article 370(1)(d), from time to time.” The petitions are pending adjudication before a bench headed by Justice N V Ramana and are likely to be taken up on November 14. The Centre said the first Presidential Order, under Article 370(1)(d), was passed on January 26, 1950. This was superseded and replaced by another Presidential Order in 1954, which was amended on more than 50 occasions from time to time, it said. The ministry said terrorism, militancy and separatism have seriously impeded overall economic development of the state despite large monetary support from the government of India. It said since 1990 till August 4, 2019, as many as 41,861 persons including 14,035 civilians, 5,129 security personnel and 22,535 terrorists have been killed in 70,960 incidents of terrorist violence. “From 2004 to 2019, the Centre has spent Rs 2,77,000 crore for the erstwhile state of J&K. During 2011 and 2012, while only Rs 3,683 per person was given to rest of India, Rs 14,255 per person was given to the erstwhile state of J&K. Further, during 2017-18, an average amount of Rs 8,227 per person was spent in rest of India, whereas Rs 27,358 per person was spent in J&K,” the ministry said. “Despite this overwhelmingly disproportionate expenditure, it was observed that the development benefits were not percolating to people of J&K... Growth potential of the erstwhile state remains largely untapped despite large monetary support from the Centre. Internal resources of erstwhile state, both public and private, are very limited, and the situation coupled with the (Art 370 mandated) legal regime, operated as a severe disincentive to private investment,” it said.

""When Article 370 was abrogated from Jammu and Kashmir, people were wondering how things will pan out but the situation remained peaceful. ""It is for the first time in the history of Kashmir that in the first 100 days post abrogation of Article 370, no major terror incident was reported from the valley,"" he added.

" Centre justifies Article 370 decision in SC; says militants, separatists were taking advantage | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Centre justified in the Supreme Court on Monday the abrogation of provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, saying the militants and separatist elements, with the support of foreign forces inimical to India, were taking advantage of the situation. A five-judge bench of Justice N V Ramana, Justice S K Kaul, Justice R Subhash Reddy, Justice B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant is scheduled to take up for hearing a batch of petitions challenging abrogation of provisions of Article 370 and Article 35A on November 14. In its reply to the batch of petitions, the Centre said that Article 370, in its original form, was constitutionally described as a temporary provision with respect to Jammu and Kashmir, formed a part of the Constitution of India as adopted by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949. The Centre's affidavit said it was observed over the years that the existing regime under Article 370 of the Constitution, and the exceptions/modifications carried out to other provisions of the Constitution of India by Presidential Orders issued under Article 370(1)(d), were impeding, rather than enabling or facilitating, the full integration of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country which was neither in the national interest nor in the interest of the State of Jammu and Kashmir. ""The militants and separatist elements, with the support of foreign forces inimical to India, were taking advantage of the situation and sowing discord, discontent and even secessionist feelings among the populace of the State,"" the affidavit said. It said, ""What is more, the residents of the erstwhile State were also being denied all the benefits of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India to all other citizens of the country."" The Centre said it cannot be disputed that the existence of Article 370 for over seven decades, in spite of it being merely a temporary provision, prevented the people of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir to receive benefits of evolving legal systems as even the amendment of the Constitution of India and other law of Parliament were not applicable to the said state creating a separatist mindset. It said that accordingly, a decision was taken that it would be in national interest and in the interest of the security and integrity of the country, that the existing regime under Article 370 be discontinued. ""It was also decided that it would be essential that the entirety of the provisions of the Constitution of India be made applicable to the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir, so that the said State and its people may enjoy the full protection of all of the provisions of the Indian Constitution as well as all civil/penal welfare legislations are made applicable,"" the affidavit said. The Centre further said the abrogation of Article 370 provisions would also act as a catalyst for enabling the State to achieve its development potential to the fullest, and to provide to its people the best possible standard of living in an ""atmosphere of peace, amity and tranquillity"". It said these constitutional decisions were effectuated strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution of India. The Centre further said that though judicial review is part of the Constitutional power of the court, the justification, efficacy, desirability and the wisdom of such decisions of the President as well as Parliament ""is not amenable to judicial review"". ""It is submitted that the sphere of constitutional challenge is to be limited to Part III of the Constitution and the pleadings of the petitioners with regard to the rationality or the wisdom of impugned decision/legislative measures, are to be rejected by this court,"" the affidavit said. Referring to Chapter 21 of the Constitution that deals with temporary, transitional and special provisions in relation to certain states, the Centre said the special provisions from Article 371A to Article 371J contain specific provisions for certain states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Sikkim, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa and Karnataka. ""However, the entirety of the Constitution of India is applicable to all of these states. On the other hand, in case of the then State of Jammu and Kashmir, in the first instance, on the Constitution of India coming into force, only Article 1 and Article 370 applied to that State. All other provisions of the Constitution were to be made applicable to the then State of Jammu and Kashmir by the President of India, with such exceptions and modifications as considered necessary,"" it said. The Centre also justified the abrogation of Article 35A of the Constitution which ""enabled the then State to make laws giving special rights and privileges to permanent residents, while imposing restrictions upon others"". Several political parties, including the National Conference (NC), the Sajjad Lone-led J&K Peoples Conference and CPI (M) leader Mohd Yousuf Tarigami have filed pleas, challenging the Centre's August 5 decision. The petition was filed by Lok Sabha MPs Mohammad Akbar Lone and Justice Hasnain Masoodi (retd) on behalf of the NC. In 2015, Justice Masoodi had ruled that Article 370 was a permanent feature of the Constitution. Several other individuals have also moved the apex court challenging the Centre's decision.

 Police using online tools to gauge post-Ayodhya mood | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies in the country are using technology called “sentiment analysis programme” to monitor the world wide web and various social media platforms for any online propaganda and radicalisation attempts related to the Ayodhya verdict, which was announced by the Supreme Court on Saturday. The programme is helping police scan for provocative messages and keep tabs on impressionable youths through their online behaviour. By tapping into open source platforms, this programme filters comments and posts on sites and chat rooms to identify hate messages and users. “This programme can study unfiltered information on what people are really saying about a topic and, in the process, manage threats. For example, it generates an alert if somebody writes words like Ayodhya and revenge in the same post,” said an officer. Aggregating and analysing the data is easier if it is in text. However, the challenges grow when pictures, audio and videos are used. Those need to be converted and studied for flagging. Police then try and establish the user’s identity. This is a tough task given the use of retweets and bot accounts. Another related tech, lexical analysis, is being used to identify frequently searched terms on social media or keywords common within a timeframe. This also helps police interpret information about the accountholder through publicly available data on the internet. The Lexical analysis helps police monitor social media and identify threats to a great extent during sensitive events. The power of online activity was established after agencies busted budding modules of Islamic State (IS) a few years ago. A Roorkee-based Islamic State operative, Akhlaq Ur Rehman, who was arrested by the Delhi Police special cell, was tapped by an IS recruiter after he wrote a Facebook post expressing anguish over the Babri Masjid demolition. Since then, the special cell has stepped up scrutiny of internet-enabled platforms. A separate unit named Counter Intelligence Cell (CIC) was created early this year to snoop on open source platforms. Counter Intelligence Cell not only keeps tab on social media activity, but also infiltrates jihadi groups and other congregations on chat platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp to collect intelligence and monitor their activities. After the Ayodhya verdict, the alert level in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Mumbai is expected to be high for at least the next fortnight. Special cell sources said that the alert has been heightened because Pak-based outfits, who are already trying to strike back on abrogation of Article 370, would try and carry out an attack more vigorously in Delhi or Uttar Pradesh.

Lift all restrictions in Kashmir: Pak PM Imran tells India at Kartarpur inauguration ceremony - Times of India,"KARTARPUR: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Saturday raked up the Kashmir issue at the inauguration of the historic Kartarpur corridor and urged India to end all restrictions in the Valley imposed after New Delhi scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special status. Prime Minister Khan inaugurated the Kartarpur Corridor for the followers of Guru Nanak Dev, allowing them to visit the revered founder of Sikhism's final resting place in Pakistan's Punjab province. The corridor provides visa-free access to Sikh pilgrims, allowing them to travel to Gurudwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, where Guru Nanak Dev spent the last 18 years of his life. Raising the issue of Kashmir, Khan said he had suggested to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi during their first meeting that it should be resolved. ""What we are witnessing in Kashmir today, it is not a territorial issue anymore. It has escalated to a humanitarian crisis. Unfortunately things have gotten even worse for the people of Kashmir who are treated like animals, deprived of their basic human rights and besieged by a presence of 9 lakh soldiers,"" Khan said. On August 5, India revoked the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into two union territories- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, drawing a sharp reaction from Pakistan. Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with India and expelled the Indian High Commissioner after New Delhi abrogated provisions of Article 370. Islamabad has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". India has always maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is its integral part and ruled out any third party mediation, including either from the UN or the US, saying it is a bilateral issue with Pakistan. Prime minister Khan said the sub-continent will only progress when the issue of Kashmir is resolved. ""Resolution of Kashmir issue will lead to greater prosperity and mutual development of India and Pakistan. Kashmir issue has resulted 70 years of hatred between the two countries. India must ensure justice to people of Kashmir. Hope one day our relationship will improve,"" he said. Prime minister Khan also said a leader will always bring people together and will not divide them. ""A leader does not spread hatred and seek votes on the basis religion,"" he said. Earlier, Prime Minister Modi flagged off the first batch of over 500 pilgrims, saying it will be easy to pay obeisance at the Darbar Sahib gurdwara after the opening of the Kartarpur corridor. He also thanked Khan and said the opening of the historic corridor had brought immense happiness. ""I also thank Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan for understanding India's wishes and turning Kartarpur into reality,"" Modi said. Foreign minister Qureshi in his speech noted that while Modi thanked Khan for opening the corridor, will the Indian prime minister also give his Pakistani counterpart the chance to thank him. ""You can do so by lifting the curfew in Kashmir, ending the use of pellet guns, ending the violations of human rights [and] by ending the communication blackout,"" he said. Qureshi said just as the doors of Kartarpur have opened, the doors of Srinagar's Jamia Masjid should also be opened so that the Kashmiris can offer Friday prayers. The inauguration of the corridor comes in the midst of frayed ties between India and Pakistan following the New Delhi's August 5 decision. Notwithstanding a chill in bilateral ties over Kashmir, India and Pakistan after tough negotiations signed an agreement last month, paving the way for the inauguration of the Kartarpur corridor on November 9.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan formally inaugurated the historic corridor to facilitate the visa-free entry of Indian Sikh pilgrims. He welcomed the first batch of the Indian Sikh pilgrims who entered Pakistan through the corridor which links Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan, the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev, to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Punjab's Gurdaspur.

Speaking to Pakistani reporters, the former prime minister termed the opening of the corridor as a ""big moment"". ""India and Pakistan relations will improve enormously as a result of this beginning,"" he said. The 87-year-old two-time prime minister and his wife paid obeisance at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. Punjab chief minister Amarinder said the Sikh community has been waiting for a free passage for 70 years, and maintained that it is a good beginning, The Nation newspaper reported. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee members and all the 117 MLAs and MPs from Punjab including ministers are also part of the first 'jatha'. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the first batch of over 500 pilgrims, saying it will be easy to pay obeisance at the Darbar Sahib gurdwara after the opening of the Kartarpur corridor. Asserting that he is fortunate to be able to dedicate the Kartarpur corridor to the country, Modi said the opening of the corridor and the integrated check post will bring double happiness to the people. India and Pakistan relations touched a new low after the Indian government on August 5 abrogated the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and its bifurcation into two Union Territories.

Roads connecting the summer capital of the newly-formed union territory with far flung areas like Gurez, Macchil, Keran and Tangdhar were also shut due to adverse weather conditions. ""The Jammu-Srinagar highway remains closed for traffic due to heavy snowfall on either side of the Jawahar Tunnel.

Depending on the weather situation, flights may be able to operate later in the day,"" the official said. Heavy snowfall across Kashmir on Thursday severely affected essential services like electricity and water supply. The unseasonal snowfall has resulted in uprooting of trees and electric poles in many areas. There was scant traffic movement on Friday as people could not come out of their homes due to blocked lanes. The snowfall also accentuated the effect of the shutdown over abrogation of Article 370.

 Citizens bound to suffer in a situation like in J&amp;K: SC | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Some citizens are bound to be inconvenienced in a curfew-like situation, a Supreme Court bench said on Thursday as it heard Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad’s petition alleging that the clampdown in J&K post-August 5 resulted in denial of fundamental rights to the inhabitants of Kashmir Valley as a whole. Appearing for Azad, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told a bench of Justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai that the Centre miserably failed to facilitate Kashmiris’ fundamental rights while enforcing complete clampdown in the Valley after its August 5 decision to scrap special status to J&K and dividing the state into two Union Territories. Sibal said while the government has the power to impose restrictions on citizens to maintain law and order but at the same time, it must facilitate the citizens to enjoy their fundamental rights to communicate, travel, approach hospital, carry on with their profession, attend schools etc. “They (the government) thought that there will be a reaction to their (August 5) decision, so decided to suppress the reaction with the whole might of the state. But in the process, it forgot that every power comes coupled with a duty. This type of exercise of power will destroy functional democracy,” Sibal said. With the senior advocate saying that it was impossible for Kashmiris to communicate with their wards studying or working outside the state and that they found it difficult to go to hospitals, Justice Gavai said, “In a situation like this, there is bound to be some difficulty for citizens. In any curfew situation, some citizens are bound to suffer.” Sibal said some suffering for a small period of time was understandable but a complete clampdown for more than two months could never be justified. He triggered a strong objection from the Centre’s counsel Rajat Nair for his “when I leave the territory of India and enter the territory of Jammu and Kashmir...” phrasing. Nair emphasised that J&K was an integral part of India. Arguing against the curbs imposed in J&K, Sibal said, “Mere apprehension (of the government) that something might happen cannot be a justification for throttling speech and communication links. There has to be cogent evidence to back such exercise of power. They must tell the court, not through sealed cover, what were the compelling reasons to impose such unprecedented clampdown on the Kashmiris. Taking such measures against certain troublemakers is justifiable. But to bracket the entire population of a state as troublemakers to stifle their fundamental rights cannot be justified.” He said Azad was stopped twice from entering his home state. “The reason given was that it would create a law and order situation. He travelled in the state for five days after getting permission from the Supreme Court. It did not create any law and order situation. Why would the government impede Azad’s fundamental right to engage in his profession that involves meeting the people and understanding their problems?” he asked. The senior advocate said apple traders were the worst affected because of the clampdown as their produce suffered massive damage. “The state suffered Rs 10,000 crore economic loss because of the clampdown,” he said, prompting the court to ask whether the facts narrated by Sibal were taken from the ground or from media reports? Sibal conceded that when the communication link was disrupted, he had to rely on media reports. “The onus is on the government to justify its action with cogent reasons, none of which was given in the notification diluting Article 370,” he said.

 SC to Ghulam Nabi Azad on restrictions in Kashmir: Should authorities have waited for riots to take place? | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday questioned senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on his opposition to the imposition of various restrictions following the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, and asked if the authorities should have ""waited for riots to take place"". ""In an issue like this, why cannot apprehension be there that the entire area or the place may be disturbed?"" a bench headed by Justice N V Ramana asked Azad's party colleague and counsel Kapil Sibal, who argued that it was a ""colourable exercise of power"" on the part of the authorities to impose restrictions, including on communication and transportation. The senior advocate was arguing that without having materials to support their apprehensions about danger to public tranquillity, the authorities cannot impose such restrictions. He argued before the bench, also comprising justices R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai, how the government can assume that the entire population would be against it and there would be law and order problem. ""In the 10 districts of the valley, was it necessary to paralyse seven million people like this? They have to show the materials,"" Sibal said, adding, ""Here, we are not talking about rights of people of Jammu and Kashmir. We are talking about rights of people of India."" He said that the authorities may have apprehensions about law and order problem there but they need to have materials to back their apprehensions. The bench asked, ""Should they have waited for riots to take place?"" Responding to this, Sibal said, ""How can they assume that riots will take place? It shows there is assumption in their minds and there are no materials. They can have intelligence input to say so."" He said that state has wide powers and if the situation arises, the authorities may impose section 144 (power to issue order in cases of nuisance on apprehended danger) of the CrPC. Sibal said it is the bounden duty of the State to protect not only the rights of citizens but also those who are in need. ""What is happening in Jammu and Kashmir, people of India are entitled to know,"" he said while referring to restrictions imposed on modes of communication there. ""This is a complete misuse of section 144 of CrPC. It is colourable exercise of power. It is constitutionally impermissible,"" he said, adding, ""You cannot say that everyone living in a district may disturb the peace."" He said in an extraordinary situation, it can happen but the authorities must have materials to back their apprehensions. He said that orders imposing restrictions were passed on August 4, a day before abrogation of provisions of Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir. ""Why you have assumed that the entire population will be against this and on what basis?"" he said during the arguments which would continue on November 14. The bench then told Sibal, ""If that is so, then there cannot be any section 144 at any place."" The apex court also said in case of curfew imposed in an area, in some circumstances some people might suffer. He said the government can impose restrictions in certain areas under section 352 (proclamation of emergency) but that has to be passed by Parliament. Sibal said the State should have taken care of exigencies and steps to protect the fundamental rights, including that of livelihood, of the citizens. He also argued that Jammu and Kashmir has suffered an economic loss of Rs 10,000 crore due to the restrictions imposed there. During the hearing, Sibal also referred to the odd-even road rationing scheme which is presently in force in Delhi. ""Everything about the scheme is odd. Everyone do not have two cars or motorcycles,"" he said, adding that he had bought a hybrid car so that he could get exemption, but this time it has not been exempted. The bench said two-wheelers are exempted in the odd-even scheme. It also said that women, who are driving four-wheelers and are not accompanied by men, are also exempted from the odd-even scheme. The apex court had on September 16 allowed Azad to visit four districts in Jammu and Kashmir for assessing the impact on life of daily wagers due to the situation prevailing after the abrogation of provisions of Article 370. Azad's counsel had earlier told the court that there were reports that daily wagers involved in farming and working in apple orchards were facing serious problems and loss of livelihood due to the clampdown prevailing in the state. His counsel had said that Azad had thrice tried to visit the state on August 8, 20 and 24, but was sent back from the airport itself. In his petition before the top court, he has also sought permission to check on social conditions of the people after a clampdown was imposed by authorities following the scrapping of the state's special status.

 MHA issues notice to IAS officer who quit over J&amp;K curbs | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Kannan Gopinathan, an AGMUT-cadre IAS officer who resigned on August 21, 2019 citing “denial of freedom of expression” to the people of Jammu & Kashmir in wake of abrogation of Article 370, now faces a disciplinary inquiry into multiple charges against him that include unauthorised absence from duty, insubordination, adoption of dilatory tactics and dereliction of duty. The home ministry proposes to hold the inquiry under Rule 6 of All India Services (Disciplinary & Appeal) Rules, 1969, which lists penalties for errant officers ranging from mere censure and withholding of promotion/increment to dismissal from service. While Gopinathan is presently posted as secretary in power department for the Union territories of Daman & Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, he has not been attending office since August 26 even though he was advised so until his resignation was accepted. This absence, as per the memorandum served on him by the home ministry (the controlling authority for UT cadre officers) on October 24 and later tweeted by him, was without any intimation or prior sanction of leave. The ministry has accordingly charged him of grave misconduct in violation of Rule 3 of All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968. Another Article in the memorandum — which asked Gopinathan to respond to the charges within 15 days — charged him with unauthorised communication with print, electronic and social media, adding that such criticism of the government policies “is capable of embarrassing the relations of Central government with other organisations including foreign State”. He acted in a manner unbecoming of a government servant, violating Rule 6 and 7 of AIS conduct rules, it added. Also charging him with adopting dilatory tactics and insubordination as collector, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the ministry accused him of delay in processing policy matters relating to discontinuation of permanent residence certificate, delaying laying of underground cables, not submitting his tour report to higher authorities after return from official tour to flood-hit areas of Kerala and bypassing his controlling officer while submitting files. Accordingly, he was charged with failure to maintain absolute integrity, devotion to duty, in contravention of Rule 3 of conduct rules. Gopinathan, reacting to the memorandum on his Twitter handle on Wednesday, accused the home ministry of targeting officers. “After 5 years of enlightened leadership one would expect you to be masters in intimidation and targeted harassment at least,” he commented.

Top intelligence sources in Srinagar revealed that the new objective of Islamabad is to defeat the very purpose of scrapping Article 370, by driving a deep wedge between “non-Kashmiris” and Kashmiris, and finally upsetting entry of Indians into the Union Territory.

The plan, reports say, has the backing of the top heads in the Pakistan Army and its intelligence wing, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The new pattern emerging from the killings in the Valley, executed at the behest of the ISI, pose a threat to over 20,000 migrant labourers and skilled workers settled in south Kashmir. “The sinister design reminds of the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits in early 1990s, when ISI-backed outfits targeted Pandits in the Valley resulting in a mass exodus,” said an IPS officer of the J&K Police. Intelligence sources said over 500 armed militants, which includes over 200 trained Pakistani terrorists, are hiding in Kashmir.

""Article 370 was included in the Constitution of India as a temporary provision due to the political circumstances of the time. This has deprived people of all developmental measures.

Unabated acrimony has visitors to Pakistan worried | Amritsar News - Times of India,"AMRITSAR: Despite suspension of bilateral talks between India and Pakistan, both countries agreed to move ahead with the Kartarpur corridor in view of the religious sentiments of the followers of Sikhism. Pakistan, however, continues to provoke India along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, by extending open support to Kashmiri separatists post August 5 and more. The latest provocation came on Sunday after Pakistan rejected the recently-released map of the newly-created Union Territories (UT) of J&K and Ladkakh, leading to apprehension of anti-India provocations by Pakistan among the devotees willing to undertake pilgrimage to Kartarpur Sahib via Kartarpur corridor. On Sunday, Pakistan said, ""No step by India can change the 'disputed' status of Jammu and Kashmir recognised by the United Nations. Such measures by the government of India cannot prejudice the inalienable right to self-determination of the people of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir."" India had on Saturday released the map of country showing the newly created UTs of J&K and Ladakh. The Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said on Sunday, ""Displaying Jammu and Kashmir region and seeking to depict parts of Gilgit-Baltistan and J&K (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) within the territorial jurisdiction of India are incorrect, legally untenable, void and in complete violation of the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. Pakistan rejects these political maps, which are incompatible with the UN maps."" ""Ahead of the opening of Kartarpur corridor, Pakistan's reaction is an indication of raking up Kashmir issue even during the presence of Indian pilgrims, as it had been extending support to Khalistan separatists from gurdwara platforms during religious functions held in Pakistan,"" said an intelligence official. Intelligence sources said their concern stems from Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's support to Kashmiri separatists ever since India revoked the Article 370 from J&K. ""I am afraid that PM Khan's brazen support to Kashmiri militants could reflect on our pilgrimage too, since Pakistan government had never been so openly vociferous in their support to Kashmiri militants in the past as Imran Khan has been provoking them since August 5,"" said Swaran Singh, who has applied for online registration for Kartarpur visit. ""Believe it or not, there is some fear in the heart of every pilgrim,"" said Rosy Kaur, who has also done online registration for the pilgrimage.

" Winter's coming, J&amp;K admin likely to shift detainees from J&amp;K hotel soon | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: As winter sets in, the J&K administration is looking for an accommodation to shift 34 political detenees from Centaur Hotel here as it lacks proper heating arrangements, officials said. The winter chill has started taking a toll on the health of the detenues - National Conference, PDP and People's Conference leaders and prominent social activists - and security personnel guarding them.  They have been lodged at the hotel on the bank of Dal Lake since August 5 when the central government announced its decision to abrogate Jammu & Kashmir's special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and split the state into two Union territories. According to the officials privy to the development, Centaur Hotel, owned by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), has submitted a bill of 2.65 crore to the home department for 90 days of boarding and lodging of the detenues.  The administration has, however, rejected the claims of Centaur Hotel and argued that the facility was converted into a subsidiary jail on August 5 and therefore, government rates would be paid.  The rates sanctioned by the administration would be around 800 per day as against 5,000 charged by the hotel, the officials said.  During the winter, temperature in Srinagar dips below the freezing point. The seat of administration in the newly created Union territory has moved from Srinagar to Jammu for the winter months. The officials said some measures would be taken soon for shifting the detenues to different locations.  The MLA hostel on Residency Road in the heart of the city could have been an alternative accommodation, but it is now occupied by former MLAs hailing from Jammu and newly elected councillors. Unwilling to dislodge the former MLAs and councillors, the administration has started looking for a state-run or private hotel for shifting the detenues, they said.

Reacting sharply to India's move to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to bring it in line with the rest of the country, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian envoy. “We also have always enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress. We are very proud of the fact that our relationship is based on bipartisan support,” Shringla said as he referred to the presence of House Majority leader Steny Hoyer, who represented the Democratic Party in the Howdy Modi event in Houston in September. More than 50,000 Indian-Americans attended the mega event jointly addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump. Shringla also referred to the presence of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at an event at the US Library of Congress to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. “We would like to preserve that bipartisan spirit. We would like to see all members of Congress understand and appreciate the compulsions under which we are operating; appreciate the efforts of the government and people of India to bring about a change for the positive in Jammu and Kashmir to understand that the changes that have been brought about enjoy the support of the vast majority of people of India,"" he said. The envoy hoped that US lawmakers would also understand and reconcile to the fact that these changes are irreversible, these changes are for the better and these changes would be very important as we go along, even for relations between our two countries, Shringla said. Jammu and Kashmir transitioned into a union territory from a state on Oct 31 in accordance with the government's announcement withdrawing the state's special status under Article 370 and bifurcating it into union territories. Referring to the new political map of India with these two Union territories, Shringla said, “I'm happy to tell you that today, if you look at the map of India for the first time, you see a united and unified map.” Addressing the Indian-Americans on the occasion, he said, that they, as important representatives of the community, would no doubt carry this message wherever they go Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Restrictions imposed on Friday lifted from all parts of Srinagar | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Restrictions that were imposed in view of Friday prayers were lifted from all parts of the city on Saturday, but normal life remained affected for 90th day in Kashmir following the abrogation of provisions of Article 370. ""There are no restrictions on movement of people in any part of the Valley today. Normal activities are being witnessed across Kashmir,"" a police official said. While Friday prayers were not allowed in the historic Jamia Masjid in Nowhatta area for 13th week, Khoj-e-Digar -- the special evening prayer held at Naqashband Sahib shrine here -- was not allowed on Friday. It was for the first time that Khoj-e-Digar, which is a centuries-old tradition specific to Kashmiri Muslims, was not been offered. The official, however, said the deployment of security forces continues in vulnerable areas of the city and elsewhere in the valley for maintaining law and order. The situation across the Valley so far is peaceful, the official said. Although there was increased movement of private vehicles and cabs on the city roads, normal life remained disrupted in the valley for the 90th day following abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into Union territories. Markets closed around noon, the self-imposed deadline of operations in Kashmir, while educational activities, except for the board examinations remained suspended, the official said. The efforts of the state government to open schools over the past three months have not borne any fruit as parents have kept children at home due to apprehensions about their safety. While landline and postpaid mobile phone services have been restored across the valley, all Internet services continue to remain suspended since the night of 4 August -- hours before the Centre announced its decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370. Most of the top level and second rung separatist politicians have been taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders including former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti have been either detained or placed under house arrest. The government has detained former chief minister and sitting Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar Farooq Abdullah under the controversial Public Safety act, a law enacted by his father and National Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978 when he was the chief minister.

 India works to get Capitol Hill’s support on Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Taken aback at the sharp anti-India sentiments that manifested itself in the US Congress recently, both India and the US are taking corrective steps to restore the balance. George Holding (R) from South Carolina made the most spirited defence of the Modi government's Kashmir policy in the House of Representatives on Thursday. Describing Article 370 as an ""outdated provision of law that the Indian Constitution recognised as “temporary"", he said the steps that Prime Minister Modi and Indian Parliament have taken “are needed, they’re good for the long-term stability of the region, and they should be applauded”. Criticising Pakistan's continued policy of cross-border terrorism, Holding, the co-chair of the India Caucus, said, ""Pakistan-based terror groups have recently floated posters warning common citizens against venturing out, going to work, and visiting public places. The groups have continued to engage in cross-border terrorism and have attacked civilians and children. These militant groups have also attacked migrant workers and those who are involved in the apple business which is the chief crop of Kashmir."" The Modi government, he said, was right to address a situation which was being used by forces to foment terrorism and separatism. ""The Modi government had to make a decision on whether to continue with the old policy or pursue progress by changing the region’s legal status."" For its part, the Indian government is improving its own Congressional outreach processes, putting together what officials called a comprehensive strategy. This comes after it was concluded that many of the officials in the mission have been less than outgoing, coming late for meetings and refusing to take questions from their interlocutors etc leading to several complaints about their efforts. The strategy includes focused outreach with key Congress leaders by Indian ambassador Harsh Shringla. Indian officials are increasing the frequency and intensity of their briefings of Congressional staffers and aides, most of whom are very powerful and hold a strong influence with the lawmakers. Over the next few weeks, Indian officials from the mission are expected to meet a large number of Congress leaders in their constituencies, particularly those having large number of Indian community members. Engaging the Capitol Hill is a full time effort, but the Indian mission has traditionally put in a few political officers on the job. Sources said this would be intensified over the coming weeks. For instance, ambassador Shringla met Democrat Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday to address the differences. Sherman used to be more positive about India, but at a recent foreign relations committee hearing, he seemed hostile to India. Both sides were working to restore the relationship, sources said. This is important since Pakistan has put in resources and lobbying organisations to counter India in different ways, even through disinformation and misleading statements.

" India, Germany slam nations backing terror | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: German chancellor Angela Merkel’s meeting with PM Narendra Modi on Friday saw India and Germany coming down hard on terrorism, with the leaders calling for a halt to cross-border movement of terrorists and for countries not to allow their territory for launching terror attacks on other nations. J&K wasn’t raised at the delegation-level talks, but the German media reported Merkel as telling them the plight of people in the Valley was not sustainable. It wasn’t clear if Merkel raised the issue with Modi. Chancellor Angela Merkel was quoted by the German media on Friday as saying she would raise the issue of the plight of the people of Kashmir with PM Narendra Modi. Merkel’s reported remarks to the German media came ahead of her “restricted meeting” with Modi and after the fifth Inter-Governmental Consultations (IGC). The J&K situation was not discussed during the IGC. With a fairly large German delegation accompanying Merkel, the two countries signed more than 20 agreements and MoUs, including one for cooperation in artificial intelligence. In their discussions, Merkel is understood to have remarked on Modi returning to office with an enlarged mandate. In statements prior to the visit, the German foreign policy establishment had stuck to the line that developments in J&K related to Article 370 were an internal matter of India. The two leaders in their meeting stressed the importance of a combined effort by all countries to fight global terrorism and to send out a consistent message that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations was unacceptable to the international community. Emphasising that terrorism was a global scourge, the leaders expressed strong concern on the global threat of terrorism and their resolve to jointly combat it. “They called upon all countries to work towards rooting out terrorist safe havens and infrastructure, disrupting terrorist networks and financing channels and halting cross-border movement of terrorists,” a joint statement said. “We have resolved to intensify bilateral and multilateral cooperation to deal with terrorism and extremism,” Modi said in his media statement after the IGC. India and Germany agreed to intensify cooperation within the framework of the joint working group on counter-terrorism, including on information and intelligence-sharing on terror networks, and work together to share experiences on dealing with the growing phenomenon of radicalisation. “They emphasised the need for stronger international partnership in countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism, including through increased sharing of information and intelligence and in full compliance with the rule of law and international law, including human rights law and international humanitarian law,” the statement said.

 PDP expels RS MP Laway from party for participating in J&amp;K LG’s oath ceremony | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday expelled its Rajya Sabha MP Nazir Ahmad Laway from the basic membership of the party for participating in the oath ceremony of the first Lieutenant Governor (LG) of the newly created Union Territory of J&K. “Member of Rajya Sabha Nazir Ahmed Laway has been expelled from the basic membership of the party as he participated in the oath ceremony of first LG Girish Chandra Murmu in Srinagar on Thursday,” a PDP spokesman said here. The decision, he said, was taken as Laway’s action undermined the PDP leadership. The spokesman said the participation of the MP was in contravention of the party stand on the current political situation and nullification of Article 370. This was not the first time that Laway had gone against the directives of the party, he said. Earlier this year, Laway had flouted the party decision and abstained from voting against the Triple Talaq Bill in the Upper House, the spokesman added. Even after Laway was asked by the party to explain such behaviour, the legislator continued to violate party norms. Therefore, the PDP leadership decided to expel him from the party’s basic membership with immediate effect, the spokesman said. When contacted, Laway said, “I have not been informed about my expulsion from PDP. There are, however, some leaders in the party who always wanted me to resign from the RS.” Laway further said that his relations with the current PDP leadership were not fine, though he had had very good rapport with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, when he was heading the party. On August 5, Parliament had decided to nullify Article 370 and reorganize the state of Jammu & Kashmir into two Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh.

 Deja Vu: Move over NCP-Sena; NCP-BJP ready to tango? | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The United colour of confusion that Maharashtra politics has become, seems to be further complicated by the role of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is playing both ways. But, if sources are to be believed, the BJP has got its arithmetic right, regardless of a not so rosy chemistry before the election. While the world knows about the meeting between NCP stalwart Sharad Pawar and Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday evening, very few know that the NCP and BJP too are in touch with each other. Informed sources suggest, BJP, which is faced with an adamant Shiv Sena that is not budging from its claims of a 50-50 agreement and sharing CM post, is exploring option of staking claim to form Government without the help of Sena and going for a floor test. Given that BJP has only 105 MLAs, 40 short of the majority, the recent opening of talks with NCP, through back channel is to explore options. One of the major option on the table is that NCP will walk out of the house just ahead of the floor test, bringing down the strength of the 288-member house. NCP has 54 MLAs. Given that PM Modi hit out at Pawar during campaign for his stand on abrogation of Article 370 and the Enforcement Directorate's role in making Pawar play 'martyr', for NCP to give support to a BJP government may be a tough ask. But abstaining or walking out of the house during floor test will not hurt NCP's image, and benefit BJP. Earlier, IANS reported that BJP already has support of 6 more MLAs which consist of one MLA from a smaller party and 5 independents. To top that, Barshi MLA Rajendra Raut is also slated to join the BJP. With NCP walking out, the strength comes down to 234 and the majority mark comes down to 118. With BJP's 105 MLAs and 6 extras and Rajendra Raut, BJP's tally goes up to 112. The BJP is confident, they are well placed to grab 5 more MLAs which is needed to cross the halfway mark. Also the fact, both Ajit and Sharad Pawar are facing ED heat, this extention of olive branch to the BJP may prove to be a win-win for both. Even in 2014, under similar circumstances, NCP had lent outside support to Fadnavis, in Maharashtra. So is the game set for BJP? Maharashtra situation continues to remain fluid. But this backdoor talk between BJP and NCP has created a sense of deja vu for both the parties. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

""The member of Rajya Sabha, Nazir Ahmed Laway, has been expelled from the basic membership of the party,"" a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) spokesman said in a statement here. The decision, he said, has been taken by the party leadership in view of Laway's participation in the swearing-in ceremony of the newly appointed Lieutenant Governor in Srinagar undermining the party's stand. He said that the participation of the MP was in contravention to the party's stand regarding the current political situation and the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 of the Constitution. G C Murmu was on Thursday sworn in as lieutenant governor (L-G) of Jammu and Kashmir. The union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, have been carved out of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, in accordance with the government's August 5 decision to revoke the special status of the state under Article 370 and bifurcate it into two UTs. This is not for the first time that Laway has gone against the directives and instructions of the party, the spokesman said. Prior to this, Laway had abstained from voting against the triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha this year.

 Indian Embassy in US reaches out to Congressmen | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Nov 1, 2019)New Delhi: The Indian Embassy in the US has launched an outreach programme among US Congressmen after some Democratic lawmakers raised concernsabout the ground situation in Kashmir. Led by Indian envoy Harsh V Shringla, the Embassy has identified key Congressmen with decision-making abilities for focused engagement. While Shringla is personally engaging with individual Congressman, other diplomats from the mission are traveling to key US states to work with Congressmen in their constituencies, ET has learnt. The Embassy has also made efforts to provide information on developments in Jammu & Kashmir on a real-time basis to Congressmen and their staffers. A delegation of Congressional staffers may visit India shortly to get an understanding of the Kashmir situation, ET has learnt. A comprehensive strategy for a focused and coordinated outreach to Congress has been planned by the Ministry of External Affairs and the Embassy. Foreign minister S Jaishankar is expected to visit Washington DC in near future and a 2+2 (Foreign-Defence Minister) Dialogue is being planned on that occasion. The Embassy is planning to hold at least two joint events over the next few weeks with key Congressmen in their constituencies to meet Indian community representatives there. Diplomats from the Indian Embassy in Washington and consulates have been deployed to work the corridors of Congress and engage with congressional staffers to appraise them about the situation in Kashmir and threats from across the border. The ambassador has himself engaged with more than 100 Congressmen besides briefing the House Foreign Relations Committee on the decision to scrap Article 370 and the situation in Kashmir. Similar briefings in the US Senate for both senators and their staffers are also being planned. The Embassy is also working with friends of India, including Jewish groups, business lobbies and professional associations in securing better access to key US Congressmen and engaging them. Meanwhile, the five Indian consulates in the US are mobilising the Indian community to garner support for India’s position, ET has learnt. A subcommittee of the US Congress on October 22 conducted a hearing on the human rights situation in South Asia, with a special focus on the Kashmir Valley in the backdrop of the abrogation of Article 370, with some Congressmen calling for an active US role to defuse what they called a “humanitarian crisis”. Experts familiar with US politics told ET that Congressmen from the Democratic Party, who have critical views on human rights situation in Kashmir, belong to the Left faction within the party and see this as thecorrect strategy to garner votes in the backdrop of increasingly Right vs Left polarisation in American politics.

Speaking to reporters during her two-day tour of Amethi after participating in 'Run for Unity' to commemorate the Sardar Patel's birth anniversary, Irani said, ""It is easy for people to comment on Patel, lay claims, but very difficult to follow in his footsteps."" ""It was also difficult for Congress to vouch for a unified India as the grand old party opposed the annulment of Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir,"" said Irani. ""If she (Priyanka) supports the vision of Patel, then she should have participated in 'Run for Unity' for which PM Narendra Modi had given a clarion call,"" she said adding that Priyanka was not present in Amethi or Rae Bareli which showed how much respect and regard Congress leadership had for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday transitioned from a state into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, nearly three months after the NDA government abrogated the state's special status. Asked about the Secretary General's comment as Jammu and Kashmir ceased to be a state, the UN chief's Deputy Spokesman Farhan Haq during a media briefing on Thursday said, “Well, just to reiterate our basic concerns that the Secretary General has previously expressed his concerns about the situation in Kashmir. As you know, he has met with representatives of India and Pakistan at their request to discuss the situation."" Haq said the UN chief has appealed to both India and Pakistan ""to deal with the issue through dialogue, and, as we've made clear and, particularly, as the High Commissioner for Human Rights has made clear, the situation in Kashmir can only be solved with full respect for human rights.” Tension between India and Pakistan has escalated after the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status. Islamabad has downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"".

Why is BJP silent on killing of Bengalis in Jammu and Kashmir? | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA/MURSHIDABAD: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday blasted BJP for its ""silence"" on the killing of five Murshidabad labourers by terrorists in Kashmir. ""Why is BJP silent on the killing of Bengalis?"" she said while inaugurating a Jagaddhatri Puja pandal at Posta. Banerjee focused on the Bengali sub-national narrative, a day after the Bengal BJP president told a reporter not to call the victims Bengalis. ""Don't describe them as Bengalis, they are labourers,"" Dilip Ghosh had said. Juxtaposing her Bengali stance with BJP's ""preference for religion"", the CM, without naming Ghosh, said: ""People from Bengal have been killed in Kashmir. We have to call them Bengalis. Aren't the labourers Bengalis? And if someone goes outside the state for work, how can they be called outsider? Our Constitution provides for free movement within the country."" Banerjee referred to past incidents in Rajasthan and Gujarat where labourers from Bengal had been killed. ""What kind of insaaf (justice) is this that labourers going to Kashmir for work are gunned down?"" she said. Taking the cue, Trinamool senior Firhad Hakim, also the state urban development minister, targeted the Centre during his visit to victims' families in Murshidabad. ""Is this what we got by de-operationalizing Article 370 in Kashmir? The Union home minister owes an answer,"" he said. ""The Centre, busy giving protection to the European Union delegation in Kashmir, bothered little to protect the labourers,"" he added. State transport minister Suvendu Adhikari bolstered Hakim's contention. ""Kashmir is under President's Rule and has become a Union Territory today. The Centre has to own up to responsibility for the killings,"" he said. Trinamool MPs and MLAs made a beeline for Murshidabad to send out the message that they were with the victims' families when BJP leaders had stayed away. Trinamool MPs Mahua Maitra, Khalilur Rahman and Abu Taher Khan, minister of state Md Zakir Hossain and youth leader Soumik Hossain were among the visitors. CPM's Murshidabad secretary Mriganka Bhattacharya and Forward Bloc's district secretary Bibhas Chakrabarty too were present. The victims' neighbours asked Hakim for help to get in touch with their relatives in Kashmir. The minister said: ""I will urge the state home secretary to get in touch with the Centre and try to establish connection with those who couldn't be contacted."" Trinamool and Congress leaders also showered monetary compensation on the victims' families. Among others, Suvendu Adhikari gave Rs 2 lakh to each bereaved family on behalf of public representatives and assured an ICDS job for a member each of the families.

Narendra Modi:   US Congressman applauds Modi for 'bold' steps in Jammu and Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: An influential American Congressman on Thursday applauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking the ""bold steps"" on Jammu and Kashmir by abrogating an ""outdated and temporary"" provision of the Constitution. On Thursday, through a government notification, two Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh came into existence, in line with the announcement on August 5 on the withdrawal of the special status of the state under Article 370 and bifurcate it into two UTs. ""The steps that Prime Minister Modi and the Parliament have taken are needed, they're good for the long-term stability of the region, and they should be applauded,"" Congressman George Holding said on the House floor on Thursday. The Republican lawmaker said the Indian Parliament passed the legislation changing the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and modified provisions that were an ""obstacle to economic development and promoted a sense of separatism."" ""Up until recently, Kashmir had been governed by Article 370, which was an outdated provision of law that the Indian constitution recognized as temporary. Article 370 might have worked well for those with political connections, but it denied economic opportunities for the people,"" he said. The temporary provision of the Indian constitution, he said, also created a ""polarizing environment"" that was exploited politically and during the past decades, thousands of people lost their lives due to terrorist attacks. ""Several groups based in Pakistan were able to conduct cross-border terrorism that wreaked havoc on individuals and families, and led to a morbid economy,"" he said. Hence, Modi government had to make a decision on whether to continue with the old policy or to pursue progress by changing the region's legal status, Holding asserted. ""Madam Speaker, the people of Jammu and Kashmir deserve better and Prime Minister Modi was right to take bold steps to address this situation. Changes to the status of Jammu and Kashmir passed by Parliament by a two-thirds majority, which highlights the consensus on the need for this reform,"" he said. Even with these changes, those seeking to cause disruption have continued to promote violence, he said. ""Pakistan-based terror groups have recently floated posters warning common citizens against venturing out, going to work, and visiting public places,"" Holding said. ""The groups have continued to engage in cross-border terrorism and have attacked civilians and children. These militant groups have also attacked migrant workers and those who are involved in the apple business, which is the chief crop of Kashmir,"" said the Republican Congressman. For Jammu and Kashmir to flourish, there must be peace and stability. Individuals and families need to feel safe when they leave their homes for work, he added. Since the Centre's decision on Article 370, terrorists have been targeting truckers and labourers, mainly who have come to the Valley from outside Kashmir. Five migrant labourers from West Bengal were shot dead by terrorists in Kulgam district of south Kashmir on Tuesday. While four truck drivers were also killed by terrorists in the past three weeks.

 President notification clears decks for J&amp;K delimitation | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The President of India, in a notification issued on Thursday, ordered suspension of operation of Section 63 of the J&K Reorganisation Act 2019, which will pave the way for delimitation of assembly and parliamentary constituencies in the successor Union Territory of J&K. The section states that notwithstanding the other provisions in the Act outlining the delimitation process to be undertaken in UT of J&K, readjusting division of the UT into assembly and parliamentary constituencies would not be necessary until after 2031 census. This is now suspended. Section 63 of J&K Reorganisation Act, as reported first by TOI on October 1, 2019, was seen as contradicting the preceding provisions — Sections 59 to 61 — of the Act, dealing with delimitation of constituencies in UT of J&K to be undertaken after the appointed day (October 31, 2019). Pointing out the flaw in wording of Section 63 — which ruled out readjustment of Parliamentary/assembly constituencies in UT of J&K until figures for first census after 2026 were published — an Election Commission official had noted that the “the said section negates the purpose of Section 59 to 61”. On Thursday, the officer said that by suspending the operation of Section 63, “the preceding sections 59 to 62 have been unshackled”. However, he added that the other anomaly in the J&K Reorganisation Act — between Section 60 that tasks Election Commission with delimitation work and Section 62 that entrusts the same responsibility to Delimitation Commission to be constituted under Delimitation Act, 2002 — has still not been addressed. As per government sources, after EC refused to take charge of the delimitation process in view of the above anomaly, the government was considering setting up a Delimitation Commission under Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act. Such a Delimitation Commission would be headed by a sitting or retired Supreme Court judge and have CEC or election commissioner nominated by CEC, as the other member. There is no word yet on setting up of a Delimitation Commission for UT of J&K. Meanwhile, a notification issued on Thursday revoked President’s rule imposed in the state of J&K, even as another ushered in central rule for an indefinite period, wherein President will discharge all functions of government of UT of J&K and enjoy all powers exercisable by LG. Powers of legislature of UT of J&K would be exercised under authority of Parliament. The notification cited a report received from J&K governor that the administration of UT of J&K could not be carried on in accordance with provisions of the Constitution and J&K Reorganisation Act, to invoke Section 73 to “prevent any constitutional and administrative vacuum” and for the proper administration of the UT of J&K. In another notification issued on Wednesday, the home ministry announced omission of references to “permanent residents or hereditary state subjects” from the state laws applicable to the two new UTs.

""I dedicate the August 5 decision (abrogating Article 370) to Sardar Sahab. That wall (the special status to J&K under Article 370) was promoting separatism and terrorism... I humbly tell Sardar Patel that the wall has been demolished.

October 31 is observed as Rashtriya Ekta Divas.  Commenting on the bifurcation of J&K into Union territories, which came into force from Thursday, the PM said, ""The new system in J&K and Ladakh is not meant to draw a line on the land (to draw a boundary) but to build a strong link of trust... The bifurcation will bring political stability to J&K; co-operative federalism will take root and new development projects like highways, railways and schools will take off."" He added that over 40,000 people had lost their lives in three decades of terrorism in J&K and Sardar Patel had inspired him to take the decision on Article 370. Modi said that from Thursday, all government employees in J&K and Ladakh will be eligible for 7th Pay Commission benefits.  Sardar Patel integrated over 500 princely states into India, but was not directly entrusted with the task of annexing the princely state of J&K. ""If the J&K issue would have been entrusted to Sardar Patel, the problem would not have lasted so long,"" he said.  Without mentioning Pakistan, Modi said that India's unity is the biggest threat to the country's adversaries. ""Those who cannot win a war against us are attempting to break the unity of our country. But nobody has, and will ever succeed at these attempts,"" he said.

 Govt to step up outreach to tribal communities of Ladakh and J&amp;K | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: With J&K and Ladakh now notified as separate Union territories the government is all set to step up the outreach to the tribal population in the region starting with Ladakh. Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) is gearing up to acquire Rs 1 crore worth products made of Pashmina, apricots and herbs like seabuckthorn from the local community based units in Ladakh to sell the same from its 107 Tribes India outlets across India. There are plans afoot to brand Ladakhi Pashmina and market it as a niche product.

TRIFED is hoping that now the Pradhan Mantri Van Dhan Yojana aimed at empowering the tribal with livelihood options by value addition to locally grown forest produce will take off in the region. The scheme, in case of tribal dominant Ladakh which is seen to be a cold desert, the focus is on apricots, herbs and Pashmina. After a two - day state wise review of proposals sanctioned and under process for Van Dhan Vikas Kendras across states, TRIFED MD, Pravir Krishna said on Thursday that Ladakh was planning to send in 10 proposals for such centres soon. He pointed that TRIFED is working on bringing products like apricots and a very important medicinal herb called Seabuckthorn into the ambit of Van Dhan scheme to bring together grassroots level networks of collectors and then link them to the value addition and marketing chain to enable financial empowerment of those involved. TRIFED, which has so far sanctioned over 660 VDVKs across states is planning to set-up 3000 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras for value addition to tribal produce across the country by March 31. While these long term plans work out, Pravir Krishna shared that to link the Ladakhi local artisans and their products to the mainstream the first consignment of locally made products will be procured by November 15 and the second by December 15 from 25 local production groups and these will be sold through the Tribes India outlets. “Also Ladakh will be showcased at the Aadi Mahotsav in Delhi starting November 16,” Krishna said. On August 17, minister for tribal affairs Arjun Munda at the national festival – Aadi Mahotsav organised in Ladakh had announced that the ministry will focus on expanding the market for the very fine quality Ladakhi Pashmina across India and abroad. The first outreach in Ladakh after the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K by the ministry of tribal affairs (MoTA) was cited as a step towards drawing Ladakh’s potential into the mainstream and create business opportunities for tribal produce and products both in Ladakh and outside.

" No final pact on Naga groups; Assam, Manipur, Arunachal to be consulted: MHA | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday said it is yet to conclude talks with Naga insurgent groups and will consult all stakeholders including the states of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh before finalisation of any settlement. In a statement, the Union home ministry said that it has come to the government's notice that a lot of rumours and misinformation is being spread in the media including social media that the final Naga settlement has been arrived at and will be announced soon. ""This is creating anxiety and concern in some parts of the country. It is clarified that before any settlement is arrived at with Naga groups, all stakeholders including states of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh will be duly consulted and their concerns will be taken into consideration. No credence needs to be given to such rumours and incorrect information,"" the statement said. The central government has already rejected the NSCN-IM's demand for unification of Naga inhabited areas -- located in Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. The three northeastern states have also vehemently opposed it. Meanwhile, normal life was paralysed in many parts of Manipur on Thursday due to ""cease-work"" stir called in support of the demand that the state's territorial integrity and administrative set up should not be affected by the Naga peace talks. The talks to find a lasting solution to the seven-decade-old insurgency problem in Nagaland continued for the forth consecutive day on Thursday, with the Centre's interlocutor and Nagaland Governor R N Ravi holding discussions with the NSCN-IM for more than three hours, officials said. While the dialogue with the Naga National Political Groups (NNPG) is said to be over, talks with the NSCN-IM, a major insurgent group in the Northeast, has been centered on its demands for a separate flag and Constitution for the Nagas. The outcome of Thursday's meeting is not known immediately. The talks were convened in Delhi in a bid to iron out differences, particularly on the NSCN-IM's demands for a separate flag and Constitution for the Nagas, which have already been rejected by the Centre. Ravi, in a statement last week, had said that a mutually agreed draft comprehensive settlement, including all the substantive issues, was ready for signing the final agreement. ""Unfortunately at this auspicious juncture, the NSCN-IM has adopted a procrastinating attitude to delay the settlement, raising the contentious symbolic issues of separate Naga national flag and Constitution on which they are fully aware of Government of India's position,"" he had said. Ravi's statement assumed significance in view of the Centre's August 5 announcement abrogating the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370. With the annulment of the special status, the separate flag and the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir cease to exist. The framework agreement was signed on August 3, 2015 by NSCN-IM leader Thuingaleng Muivah and Ravi in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The framework agreement came after over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 18 years, with the first breakthrough in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed after decades of insurgency in Nagaland which started soon after India's Independence in 1947.

"Amit Shah: Repealing Article 370, 35A shut gateway of terrorism in India | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said Article 370 and Article 35A were a gateway to terrorism in India and the Modi government, by abrogating the two provisions on August 5, had shut this gateway. “Article 370 and 35A had become a problem in J&K. For 70 years nobody wanted to touch them. After the country once again chose Modi as PM in 2019, he repealed the two Articles and fulfilled Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s half-realised dream of complete merger of J&K into the Indian Union,” Shah said while addressing an event to mark flagging off of ‘Run for Unity” on the occasion of Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary. Paying rich tributes to Sardar Patel, he said it were his tireless efforts as the country’s first home minister that over 550 Indian principalities were successfully merged into the Indian Union. He mentioned how Patel had overcome challenges to get principalities such as Junagarh, Hyderabad and Lakshadweep to accede to the Indian Union. Shah said Patel’s immense contribution was not recognised to the extent it should have been by earlier governments. It was a BJP government that conferred on him the Bharat Ratna and also had ‘Statue of Unity’, standing 180 metres tall, built as a fitting tribute to Patel. The home minister asserted that ‘Run for Unity’ was a way for the people of India to reaffirm their commitment to a united, India and pay a fitting tribute to Sardar Patel. Shah — who administered ‘Pledge of Unity’ to all those present at the event to commemorate Patel’s birth anniversary — also remembered former prime minister Indira Gandhi as October 31 is also her death anniversary. He said that under the leadership of PM Modi, India had become one of the fastest growing economies of the world and is well poised to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024.

 Reorganisation of J&amp;K internal affair: India slams China over Kashmir statement | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India on Thursday hit back at China over   its objection to the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir   into two Union Territories, saying the reorganisation is entirely its internal affair and it does not expect other countries to comment on such matters. India also said that China continues to be in occupation of a large tract of area in the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. ""It has also illegally acquired Indian territories from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) under the so-called China-Pakistan Boundary Agreement of 1963,"" a statement quoted Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar as saying. Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated on Thursday into two union territories — Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh — in accordance with the government's August 5 announcement revoking the state's special status under Article 370. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told the media in Beijing on Thursday that ""India unilaterally changed its domestic laws and administrative division challenging China's sovereignty."" ""This is unlawful and void and this is not effective in any way and will not change the fact that the area is under Chinese actual control,"" he said. Reacting to China's statement, Kumar said China is well aware of India's consistent and clear position on this issue. ""The matter of reorganisation of the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir into the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh is entirely an internal affair of India,"" he said. ""We do not expect other countries, including China, to comment on the matters which are internal to India, just as India refrains from commenting on internal issues of other countries,"" Kumar said.

 Visit by EU MPs not at all internationalisation of Kashmir issue: MEA | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The visit by EU MPs to Kashmir was not at all internationalisation of the issue and such delegations do not necessarily have to come through official channels, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday. In its first comments on the issue, the ministry also said the important point was whether such an engagement serves larger national interests. In the first visit by a foreign delegation, a team of 23 MEPs travelled to Kashmir on Tuesday on a two-day trip to have a first-hand assessment of the situation after the state's special status was revoked in August by abrogating provisions of Article 370.

 Formation of J&amp;K and Ladakh union territories 'unlawful and void': China | India News - Times of India,"BEIJING: China on Thursday objected to the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories as ""unlawful and void"", saying India's decision to ""include"" some of China's territory into its administrative jurisdiction ""challenged"" Beijing's sovereignty. Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated on Thursday into two union territories — Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh — in accordance with the Indian government's August 5 announcement revoking the state's special status under Article 370. China had earlier objected to the Indian government's August 5 order of the revocation of Article 370 and the formation of Ladakh as Union Territory, saying that some of the area involved Chinese territory. ""The Indian government officially announced the establishment of so-called Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh Union Territories which included some of China's territory into its administrative jurisdiction,"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told the media here on Thursday. ""China deplores and firmly opposes that. India unilaterally changed its domestic laws and administrative division challenging China's sovereignty,"" he said replying to a question. ""This is unlawful and void and this is not effective in any way and will not change the fact that the area is under Chinese actual control,"" he said. ""China urges the Indian side to earnestly respect Chinese territorial sovereignty, abide by our treaties and uphold peace and tranquility in the border areas and create favourable conditions for proper settlement of boundary question,"" he said. After the revocation of Article 370, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who visited China in August, informed his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir is an internal matter and the sole prerogative of India and it has no implication for either the external boundaries of India or the Line of Actual Control (LAC). On the Kashmir issue, Geng said, ""China's position on the Kashmir issue is consistent and clear, this is a dispute left from history and it should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN charter, the relevant UNSC resolutions and other bilateral treaties and relevant sides should resolve the dispute through dialogue and consultations and uphold regional peace and stability."" Since the revocation of Article 370, China, which in the past stated that Kashmir issue should be resolved between India and Pakistan, started referring to the UN charter and UNSC resolutions for a settlement. China has backed its all-weather ally, Pakistan's attempts to call for an informal meeting of the UN Security Council. However, the informal UNSC meeting, in a rebuff to Beijing and Islamabad, ended without passing a resolution or statement. A joint statement, issued at the end of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to Beijing on October 9, said, ""The Chinese side responded that it was paying close attention to the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir and reiterated that the Kashmir issue is a dispute left from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements"". Khan's visit took place ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Chennai on October 11-12, where he held his second informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In his visit to Beijing in August, Jaishankar defended the government's decision during talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang and said that the reason for the change is for better governance and social and economic development in Jammu and Kashmir. ""It has no implications for anybody else. The issue related to changes is a temporary provision of the Constitution of India and was the sole prerogative of the country,"" Jaishankar had said. ""The legislative measures were aimed at promoting better governance and socio-economic development. There was no implication for either the external boundaries of India or the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. India was not raising any additional territorial claims,"" Jaishankar said. ""The Chinese concerns in this regard were therefore misplaced,"" the minister had said, adding that as far as the India-China boundary question was concerned the two sides had agreed to a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable settlement on the basis of the 2005 Political Parameters and Guiding Principles. The India-China LAC covers 3,488 km and the Special Representatives of both the countries have held 21 rounds of talks to resolve the boundary dispute.

" Sardar Patel's dream fulfilled with J&amp;K's full integration, says Manohar Lal Khattar | India News - Times of India","CHANDIGARH: Praising the efforts of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for the country's unity, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday said the BJP government at the Centre has fulfilled his dream by fully integrating Jammu and Kashmir with the Union of India. At an event organised in Panchkula on Patel's 144th birth anniversary, which is celebrated as the National Unity Day every year, he paid glowing tributes to the first home minister of India. Khattar, who took oath for a second term on Sunday, said Patel's contribution to integrate more than 560 princely states into the Indian Union was immense. ""For unity and integrity of this country, he did a great work. At the time of Independence, when the country was divided into more than 550 princely states, Sardar Patel integrated 562 states, setting an example which one will never come across anywhere else in the world. ""At that time, three states were left, but with his efforts Hyderabad and Junagad were also integrated,"" Khattar told a gathering where school children were also present. He then touched upon the withdrawal of Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. ""It is a matter of great happiness that Jammu and Kashmir, which was not fully integrated with the Indian Union 70 years ago...but our Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah took the decision to scrap Article 370 and completed that remaining task. Sardar Patel's dream has been fulfilled,"" said Khattar. The state of Jammu and Kashmir transitioned into Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh on October 31, Patel's birth anniversary. However, the Kashmir Valley has seen shutdowns and tension since announcement about the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5. Markets have remained shut and children stayed away from school for a large part of the period. Khattar administered the 'Rashtriya Ekta Diwas' pledge to the gathering. ""All of us should dedicate ourselves to preserve the unity, integrity and security of the country and also try to spread this message among all fellow countrymen,"" he said. Speaking at an event organised in Gurugram on National Unity Day, Haryana's deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala also talked about the Patel's role in integration of the princely states. The 31-year-old JJP leader said, ""All of us, especially the youth, should take inspiration from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel"". ""Youth are the future of this country and they should dedicate themselves to preserve the unity, integrity and security of this nation,"" he said.

 Jammu and Kashmir transitions from state into two Union territories | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: As the clock struck 12 and a new day beckoned, Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday transitioned from a state into two Union territories with a wary Valley shutting down as it has for 88 days and Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the ""new system"" is aimed at ""building a strong link of trust"". President Ram Nath Kovind revoked President's rule imposed in the restive state, long the centre of global attention, and took control of the administration of the two new Union territories, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. This is the first time a state has been downsized into Union territories, the two new entities taking the total number of UTs to nine and bringing down the number of states in India to 28. The move is in accordance with the government's August 5 announcement withdrawing the state's special status under Article 370 and bifurcating the state into Union territories. Girish Chandra Murmu in Jammu and Kashmir and Radha Krishna Mathur in Ladakh stepped into history as the first lieutenant governors of the new Union territories. Jammu and Kashmir high court chief justice Gita Mittal administered the oath of office to the new appointees, first in Leh and then later in the day in Srinagar. As the changes came into effect, the Prime Minister was at the Statue of Unity in Kevadiya in Gujarat where he paid glowing tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 144th birth anniversary and led the ""national unity pledge"". Defending the abrogation of Article 370, he said the special status provisions generated terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. ""The new system in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh is not meant to draw a line on the land (to draw a boundary) but to build a strong link of trust,"" the prime minister said. ""Patel had once said that had he handled the Kashmir issue, it would not have taken so long to resolve it,"" Modi said, in a veiled swipe at first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, often blamed for the Kashmir issue by the ruling BJP. In the Kashmir valley, however, it was another day of shutdowns and tension with markets shut, deserted roads and children staying away from school as residents came to grips with the new identity of their homeland. ""This is a decision against our interests. They have robbed us of our special status and our identity,"" said Muzammil Mohamad, a resident of Srinagar's Civil Lines area. Another local, Umer Zargar, described Kashmir as a disputed territory and India's decision ""illegal, immoral and unconstitutional"". ""India cannot abrogate Article 370. This issue is in the United Nations. There are resolutions on it. This decision in illegal, immoral and unconstitutional,"" he said. For the third consecutive day, there were no vendors at a flea market near the Polo Ground in the centre of town. Roadside vendors, who had been regularly setting up their stalls for two months, have been away since Tuesday when a delegation of EU parliamentarians landed for a two-day visit to assess the situation. Landline and post-paid mobile phone services have been restored across the valley, but all internet services continue to remain suspended since the night of August 4. Most top-level and second-rung separatist politicians are in preventive custody while mainstream leaders, including two former chief ministers -- Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti - have been either detained or placed under house arrest. Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar Farooq Abdullah has been arrested under the controversial Public Safety act, a law enacted by his father and National Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978 when he was the chief minister. Addressing a gathering in the national capital, Union home minister Amit Shah said Article 370 and Article 35A were the gateways of terrorism into Jammu and Kashmir. Modi closed the gateway by repealing them, he said. Politicians of the Valley also weighed in with their views. BJP's Jammu and Kashmir spokeperson Khalid Jehangir said the move will usher in peace and development in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. ""This transition is for peace, development and dignity and our Prime Minister's vision of Jammu and Kashmir on the same lines will be achieved in the coming years with the blessings of the people of this nation,"" he said. The National Conference, however, termed the Centre's decision ""unconstitutional"" and ""not in the interest of the people of the country"". ""... The only power the Parliament has is to form a new state. May be Parliament can chip away a part of a state and create a new state.

 J&amp;K split into two UTs: What all will change from today | India News - Times of India,"This is the first time in the country that a state has been converted into two UTs. With Article 370 revoked and the reorganisation of the state coming into effect these are the changes which will take place in J&K from today — * Two new LGs instead of one governorEarlier, the unified state of Jammu and Kashmir had the post of a governor. Satya Pal Malik was the governor of the state. Now, with the reorganisation of the state into two Union territories, IAS officers — GC Murmu and RK Mathur — took oath as the LGs of the newly-formed UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, respectively. On October 25, Governor Malik was transferred to Goa. * No more separate constitutionEarlier, Jammu and Kashmir was the only state in the country with its separate constitution as per the provisions mentioned in Article 370, a 'temporary provision' that grants special autonomous status to Jammu & Kashmir. Now, the government's decision to revoke Article 370 revoked the special provision which granted power to J&K to have its own constitution. With the revocation of Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir will adhere to the Constitution of India, much like the rest of the country. * Law and orderEarlier, law and order was under the control of the state government Now, the Centre will be in direct control of the police and the law and order in Jammu and Kashmir, while the land will be under the elected government there. All India Services like the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS), and the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) will be under the control of the LG and not the elected government of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir. * Right to buy propertyEarlier, Article 35A, which is based on Article 370, empowered the J&K legislature to define the state's 'permanent residents' and grant them special rights and privileges. Now, with the scrapping of Article 370 (and hence Article 35A) people from outside J&K will also be able to to buy property in the state and settle there. * Central lawsEarlier, the central government had to seek approval of the state legislature to draft and enact laws.

 Why India kept EU politicians’ Kashmir visit ‘unofficial’ | India News - Times of India,"A delegation of 23 EU MPs on Wednesday ended a two-day visit aimed at a first-hand assessment of the ground situation in Kashmir after the revocation of the state's special status. UNOFFICIAL PRAISE: Capping a visit that attracted controversy and opposition ire, European Union parliamentarians visiting Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday said what the Indian government wanted to hear - that Article 370 is an internal issue and they stand by the country in its fight against terrorism. One parliamentarian may have strayed from the script though: ""I think if you let in European Union parliamentarians, you should also let in Opposition politicians from India,"" Nicolaus Fest of Alternative for Germany was quoted as saying by ANI. The first high-level foreign visit to Kashmir after the August 5 decision to revoke the state's special status ended on the last day of Jammu and Kashmir's existence as a state. The state has now been bifurcated into the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. NOT-SO-UNOFFICIAL VISIT: The visit, though dubbed 'unofficial' by the government and organised by a woman who calls herself an 'international business broker', entailed high level briefings by the national security adviser Ajit Doval, meetings with the Prime Minister and external affairs minister in New Delhi, Army and administration briefings in Srinagar as well as some civil society outreach. That kind of official engagement for unofficial visits is hardly seen. UNOFFICIAL REASON: ""This exercise is for India to influence international opinion, the same way every country engages foreign opinion makers for their core interests,"" says this TOI report quoting government sources. The move is also seen as taking a leaf out of Pakistan's diplomatic playbook as the neighbour regularly ferries international diplomats to PoK to influence opinion against India. OFFICIAL ADVANTAGE: An 'unofficial' visit allowed the organisers to choose the members of European parliament based on their views. That wouldn't have been the case in case of an official invitation as it would have gone to a country or an organisation who would have chosen the participants. An 'unofficial' trip would also make it easier for the government to decline similar 'official' requests from governments or multilateral institutions by saying that the Members of European Parliament (MEP) were on a personal trip. The more direct gain for India would be when the MEPs articulate the Indian government's position in debates back home. In the recent debates in the European parliament and in the UNHRC, India has taken some fire from the more liberal lawmakers, as well as from members of the Labour Party of the UK, or even the Democrats in the US. The current exercise is also seen as a response to it. Meanwhile, in Kashmir, security was stepped up on Wednesday following the terror attack in Kulgam district in which six labourers from West Bengal were killed, even as a complete shutdown disrupted normal life across the valley. The annual board examinations for class 10 and class 12 are being held as per schedule. Class 10 examinations began on Tuesday, while the class 12 exams are scheduled to start from today.

Jammu and Kashmir ceases to be a state; two new UTs come into being | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: At the stroke of midnight, Jammu & Kashmir ceased to be a state of the Union, making way for two new Union territories of J&K and Ladakh. This marks an important milestone in the history of J&K and, especially, Kashmir Valley’s tense ties with the rest of the country, and culminates the process which started on August 5 with the landmark announcement for   emasculation of Article 370   as well as end of statehood for J&K. This also put to an end to J&K’s flag and constitution, symbols of the state’s special status. With October 31 fixed as the appointed day for reorganisation of J&K, the new lieutenant governors of the two UTs — GC Murmu in J&K and RK Mathur in Ladakh — will be sworn in at separate ceremonies in Srinagar and Leh, respectively. UT status makes Ladakh a big draw for CSR fundingThe creation of the UTs of J&K and Ladakh coincides with the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, credited with the merger of over 560 states with the Indian Union and who has been promoted by the Modi government as the embodiment of national unity and muscular nationalism. The change in the status of J&K from a state to a UT comes even as there is a fresh spate of targeted attacks in the Valley against non-Kashmiris and “outsiders”, while communication curbs remain in force amid strong indications, sources in the security establishment said, of desperate efforts by Pakistan to incite trouble. Parliament’s decision of August 5 marked a dramatic turn in the history of the sensitive region, a counter-punch to a defiant clamour for enhanced autonomy and a brutal Pakistan-backed terror campaign. It came against the backdrop of a popular push in the rest of the country for a tough response to terrorism and separatists. It also represented a powerful break from the way the Centre had dealt with the border state. The old approach sought to blend toughness towards terrorists with promises to enhance autonomy and talks with Pakistan, which made no secret of its determination to grab the Muslim-majority province. The Modi government changed the terms of engagement with both the separatists and Pakistan. The conversion of the state into two UTs means that politicians in the Valley can, at most, hope for restoration of statehood. The August decision also means that Pakistan will have to try hard to re-establish its locus on J&K as and when the two sides decide to resume negotiations. The steps taken since — the communications lockdown, the defiance of global liberal sensitivities as well as the attempt this week to tap into the growing influence of right-wing globally — represents the resolve to brazen out any unhappiness in global capitals. The central government has justified its decision to make Article 370 a dead letter in J&K, blaming it for rising violence and militancy in the Valley as unemployed youth are forced to pick up the gun and for denying the people of the state benefits of many central legislations and benefits like SC/ST reservation, right to education, right to information etc. The decision to end special status for J&K marked fulfilment of BJP’s long-standing agenda and its 2014 poll manifesto promise, and conforms to the “nationalist” view that it would complete J&K’s integration with the Indian Union. This is over 70 years after the then ruler of the princely state of J&K, Maharaja Hari Singh, executed the Instrument of Accession on October 26, 1947, making it part of the Union of India. This is the first time that a state is being bifurcated into two UTs. In the past, there have been instances of a UT becoming a full state or a state being reorganised into two states. The total number of states in the country will now be reduced to 28 while the number of UTs will go up to nine. According to the J&K Reorganisation Act, the UT of J&K will have a legislature, like Puducherry, while Ladakh will be a UT without legislature, like Chandigarh, and both the UTs will be headed by two separate lieutenant governors. The Centre will be in direct control of police and law & order in J&K from Thursday while land will be under the elected government. The UT of Ladakh will be under the direct control of the central government which will administer the high altitude region through the LG. For employees of the state government, including police personnel, the change means a jump in salaries and perks as they, thanks to their new status as central employees, become eligible for pay scales fixed for central employees by the Pay Commission.

Kashmir news: Central rule to continue in Jammu Kashmir through LG | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The President's rule imposed in undivided Jammu and Kashmir was revoked on Thursday following the state's bifurcation into Union territories, but the Central rule will continue for an indefinite period through the Lieutenant Governor (LG) in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir.

The two Union territories come into existence on Thursday after the central government, on August 5, decided to abrogate the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution and create the UTs on October 31. ""In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (2) of Article 356 of the Constitution, I, Ram Nath Kovind, President of India, hereby revoke the proclamation issued by me under the said Article on 19th December, 2018 in relation to the State of Jammu and Kashmir,"" the first notification said. In the second notification, Kovind said Article 356 of the Constitution, under which President's rule was imposed in a state, was not applicable to the UTs and the provision in case of failure of the constitutional machinery with regard to the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, which has a legislature, was governed by section 73 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019. Section 73 of the Act says in case of failure of the constitutional machinery — if the president, on receipt of a report from the LG of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, is satisfied (a) that a situation has arisen in which the administration of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Act; or (b) that for the proper administration of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, it is necessary or expedient to do so, the president may, by order, suspend the operation of all or any of the provisions of this Act for such period as he thinks fit and make such incidental and consequential provisions as may appear to be necessary or expedient for administering the UT of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The president, in the notification, said he had received a report from the governor of Jammu and Kashmir that the administration of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir could not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act. ""In order to prevent any constitutional and administrative vacuum, it is necessary to invoke section 73 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 for the proper administration of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. The president said after considering the governor's report and other information, he was satisfied that a situation had arisen in which the administration of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir could not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act. ""Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 73 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, read with articles 239 and 239A of the Constitution, and of all other powers enabling me in that behalf, I hereby proclaim that I — (a) assume to myself as President of India all functions of the government of UT of Jammu and Kashmir and all powers vested in or exercisable by the LG of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir; (b) declare that the powers of the legislature or legislative Assembly of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir shall be exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament,"" the notification issued by the president said. Kovind also used the incidental and consequential provisions, which were necessary or desirable for giving effect to the objects of this proclamation. ""In exercise of the functions and powers assumed to myself by virtue of clause (a) of this Proclamation, it shall be lawful for me as President of India to act to such extent as I think fit through the LG for administering the UT of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the JK Reorganisation Act, 2019,"" the notification said. The central rule was first imposed in Jammu and Kashmir in June 2018, after the resignation of the then chief minister Mehbooba Mufti when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) withdrew support to the state government led by the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The first central rule as ""governor's rule"" continued for six months. After the six-month period, President's rule was imposed for the next six months, which was subsequently extended with the approval of Parliament. Article 356 of the Constitution, under which President's rule is imposed in a state, is not applicable to Union territories. G C Murmu and R K Mathur will be sworn-in as the first LGs of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh respectively on Thursday. Ladakh is a Union Territory without a legislature like Chandigarh.

Narendra Modi: Article 370 led to terrorism; Sardar Patel's inspiration behind abrogation | India News - Times of India,"KEVADIYA (GUJARAT): Paying glowing tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on National Unity Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday defended the   abrogation of Article 370   , saying the special status provisions only generated terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. Attending a function at the Statue of Unity here on the occasion of Patel's 144th birth anniversary, Modi led the gathering in taking the 'national unity pledge'. ""The new system in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh is not meant to draw a line on the land (to draw a boundary) but to build a strong link of trust,"" the Prime Minister said, apparently referring to the bifurcation of the state into two Union territories. Inspired by Patel, his government is working for ""emotional, economic and constitutional integration"" of the country, without which it would be difficult to imagine a powerful India in the 21st century, he said. Fulfilled Sardar Patel's dream: Amit Shah on abrogation of Article 370In a swipe at Pakistan, he said those ""who cannot win wars"" against India are trying to destroy its unity. ""The country took the decision of abrogation of Article 370, which had only given separatism and terrorism to that state,"" Modi said. ""Over 40,000 people lost their lives in three decades of terrorism,"" he said, adding that it was Patel's inspiration which made him take the decision to abrogate Article 370, and he dedicates the decision ""at the feet of"" the first home minister of the country. ""Patel had once said that had he handled the Kashmir issue, it would not have taken so long to resolve it,"" Modi said, in a veiled swipe at Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister whom the ruling BJP often blames for the Kashmir issue. ""North-East is now moving from separatism to attachment as decades-old problems are nearing resolution,"" Modi said, referring to his government's initiatives to bring peace to the insurgency-affected region. Without naming Pakistan, Modi said that some elements are trying to destroy the unity in diversity of India by spreading separatism and terrorism, but even after ""trying for centuries, nobody could annihilate us or defeat us"". ""Unity in diversity is our pride and our identity, the world is surprised by our unity despite so much diversity,"" Modi said. ""When we respect traditions and beliefs of different sects and religions, love and attachment (among people) increase,"" the prime minister said. When Patel embarked on the mission to merge over 500 princely states into India, ""feeling of unity"" inspired many rulers to join the Indian union, he said. ""Centuries ago, India was united by Chanakya (the ancient philosopher who is said to be the adviser of emperor Chandragupta Maurya), and after that Sardar Patel did it,"" Modi said. Sardar Patel's birth anniversary is celebrated as `Rashtriya Ekta Diwas' (National Unity Day) since 2014. At the function on the occasion, the wife of Naseer Ahmed, a CRPF jawan who was killed in the February 2019 Pulwama terror attack, presented Modi with a replica of the National Police Memorial which commemorates over 34,000 state and central police personnel who died in the line of duty. During the function, the prime minister offered floral tributes to the Statue of Unity, considered to be the world's tallest statue, as flower petals were showered on it from above by an Indian Air Force helicopter. The prime minister watched `Ekta parade' in which personnel of the Gujarat Police, Jammu & Kashmir Police, Central Reserve Police Force and Border Security Force took part. Mock drill demonstrations were conducted by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), National Disaster Response Force and National Security Guard.

" EU calls on India, Pak to resume dialogue amid tension over Kashmir | India News - Times of India","UNITED NATIONS: The European Union has called on India and Pakistan to avoid escalation of tension over the Kashmir issue and resume bilateral dialogue for a peaceful and political solution to the matter, after the Indian government revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status. Reacting sharply to India's move to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to bring it in line with the rest of the country, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian envoy. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"".

 Tenure of J&amp;K governor's advisers may end | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: As J&K makes the transition to two separate Union territories, including UT of J&K to be administered by a Lieutenant Governor, the term of the five advisers to outgoing governor Satya Pal Malik who helped him manage the situation following abrogation of Article 370 may also come to an end.  One of the advisers, K Vijay Kumar, confirmed the ""pleasant conclusion of our tenure"". Sources indicated that the other four advisers - former IAS officers Khurshid A Ganai, K Skandan and K K Sharma and retired IPS officer Farooq Khan - will also make an exit as their appointment orders had specifically mentioned their assignment as ""advisor to the governor"" and not to LG.  All the five advisers are senior to the newly-appointed LG of UT of J&K G C Murmu. It is not yet clear whether a new set of advisers will be brought in to assist Murmu.  The five advisers have been the team behind governor Malik through his eventful tenure that saw dissolution of the J&K assembly, imposition of governor's rule followed by President's rule, intensified counter-terror operations, conduct of panchayat elections and finally, abrogation of Article 370 in the state in early August.  The announcement of the decisions to make Article 370 a dead letter and bifurcate the state of J&K into two separate UTs was followed by tight curbs on movement and a communication clampdown that is yet to be fully lifted.  Over the past three months, the five advisers - who were allotted different departments and ministries - worked as a cohesive team under the guidance of PM Modi and national security adviser Ajit Doval, not only managing the law and order situation but also reaching out to the people of the state to explain the benefits of the historic move, hear their grievances and work on solutions.  ""It was a delicate time and the team worked with the support of the PM, NSA and the governor. With the end of term of the governor, our tenure too has come to a pleasant conclusion,"" Vijay Kumar told TOI . Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" EU MPs blame Pak for terrorism in Kashmir, stand by India | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: The 23-member delegation of EU lawmakers blamed Pakistan on Wednesday for terrorism in India. Wrapping up their two-day Kashmir visit, they said the nullification of Article 370 was India’s “internal matter” and that they stood by India in its fight against terrorism. Predominantly from far-right parties, they said on the last day of Jammu and Kashmir’s existence as a state that terrorism was a “severe problem” in Kashmir. The state of Jammu & Kashmir ceases to be a state, making way for two new Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The organisers of the EU MPs’ Kashmir visit had invited a select group of journalists to a press briefing, including the editors of three lesser-known local newspapers. Only a few of these journalists were allowed to put questions to four EU MPs — Bill Newton Dunn from the UK, Henri Malosse from France, Ryszard Czarnecki from Poland, and Thierry Mariani from France. Only three of the 23 EU MPs belonged to Left or liberal parties. “If we talk about Article 370, it is India’s internal matter. What concerns us is terrorism, which is a global menace and we should stand with India in fighting it,” Henri Malosse of France told the select group of journalists at Srinagar’s Old Airfield at Rangreth at the conclusion of their visit. The EU lawmakers said they interacted with the youth, politicians, women and traders during their two-day stay in Kashmir, adding that it was the “beginning of their engagement” with civil society there. “We are here to get information. The situation is not as bad as we thought. People here want peace, a better life and better vocations, and they want jobs. Terrorism has destroyed such dreams,” they said. The EU MPs, while regretting the killing of six labourers from West Bengal by militants in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district on Tuesday evening, said “terrorism is a severe problem in Kashmir” and named Pakistan as its source. Newton Dunn of the UK said they belong to Europe which is now peaceful after years of fighting. “And we want to see India becoming the most peaceful country in the world. And for that, we need to stand by India in its fight against global terrorism. This visit has been an eye-opener and we would definitely advocate what we have seen at ground zero,” he said. Referring to the details provided to them by the Indian Army and the police, Dunn said, “Most terrorists killed in J&K have come from abroad. In fact, they came from Pakistan. It is an international problem. All protests should be directed against terrorism.” Ryszard Czarnecki, an EU MP from Poland, said, “The international media coverage (on Kashmir) seems to be biased. Once we go back to our countries we will inform them of what we saw.” The EU MPs also criticised Pakistan for violence against the Christian community there. “We trust in freedom of religion. We are worried about the situation of Christians in Pakistan,” they said while mentioning the case of Aasiya Bibi. An EU MP from Britain said the UK faced the big problem of Northern Ireland where Christians were fighting Christians. “Fighting is not a solution. India has a long procedure of talks, agreeing to talk and listening to each other. It is for talks that Northern Ireland is a peaceful place now. My advice is talk and don’t fight,” the EU MP from Britain said. “We were told that there is too much corruption in Indian Kashmir. Money which comes from the central government does not reach projects and seems to disappear somewhere in the system,” the European lawmakers said. They added that they would invite people to visit Kashmir but that would require safe conditions. “The first condition is to fight terrorism in this part of India,” they said.

" Article 370 internal matter, says Germany on Angela Merkel trip eve | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: On the eve of a bi-annual summit visit by German chancellor Angela Merkel, German envoy Walter Lindner said his country supported the European Union position that Article 370 was India’s internal matter. “Both leaders can discuss anything, so this issue (Kashmir) may come up. We fully support the EU position in the matter as was detailed by (foreign policy chief) Federica Mogherini. Our position remains that Article 370 is an internal matter for India. But we support dialogue between India and Pakistan and any restrictions (in Kashmir) should be lifted as soon as possible,” he said. Asked about the ongoing visit by EU MEPs, he said, “The EU has already said it is a private visit and that is our stand too. We didn’t have any idea that they are coming to India and I know as much as you do.” The composition of the delegation and the nature of the visit has made it very controversial, reversing some of the gains the government may have wanted. Merkel, who will arrive on Thursday, will sign nearly 20 agreements with PM Narendra Modi. Lindner said representatives of about 15 ministries of the German government would be in Merkel’s delegation. She will be accompanied by 13 business leaders as well. The stalled Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement will feature prominently in the talks, he said. “Germany is second only to China in exports and we are totally in favour of free trade agreements. The fact that we have made no movement is not good,” he added. India and Germany have instituted a fast-track mechanism for bilateral consultations to cut through Indian bureaucratic delays in investments. Germany, Lindner said, is seventh in FDI into India. The mechanism has already solved about 18 problems while another 3-4 were pending, he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

The UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh will be headed by lieutenant governors G C Murmu and R K Mathur, respectively. They will take oath on Thursday. This is for the first time that a state is being converted into two UTs. The total number of states in the country will now be 28, while the total UTs will go up to nine. The swearing-in ceremony will be first held in Leh where Mathur would be administered oath of office followed by that of Murmu in Srinagar. With this, the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and the Ranbir Penal Code will cease to exist from Thursday, when the nation celebrates 'National Unity Day' to mark the birth anniversary of the country's first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who is credited for the merger of over 560 states into the Union of India. Both Murmu and Mathur will be sworn-in by Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Gita Mittal. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, states that the appointed day for the two UTs is October 31 and these will come into existence in the midnight (Wednesday-Thursday). The announcement of abrogation of the state's special status and its bifurcation was made in Rajya Sabha on August 5. The UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have a legislature like Puducherry while Ladakh will be a UT without legislature like Chandigarh and both the UTs will be headed by two separate lieutenant governors (LG), as per the Act. The Centre will be in direct control of the police and the law and order in Jammu and Kashmir from Thursday when it becomes a UT, while the land will be under the elected government there.

"UK's stance of Kashmir being bilateral issue between India, Pak remains unchanged: Boris Johnson - Times of India","LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday said in Parliament that the UK's long-standing stance of Kashmir being a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan remains unchanged although the situation in the Valley is of ""profound"" concern to the country. Johnson's statement came in the backdrop of the two-day trip of 23 members of European Parliament to Jammu and Kashmir to assess the situation. The visiting EU parliamentarians on Wednesday termed the dilution of Article 370 an internal issue of India and said they stand by the country in its fight against terrorism. Prime Minister Johnson -- addressing a question from Conservative Party MP Steve Baker during the last Prime Minister's Questions session before Parliament is dissolved this week ahead of the December 12 general elections -- also made a reference to Britain's colonial history in the region which made it more important for it not to intervene by prescribing any solutions. ""The welfare of communities in Kashmir is of profound concern to the UK government,"" he told MPs in the House of Commons. ""It is the long-standing position of the UK government that the crisis in Kashmir is fundamentally a matter for India and Pakistan to resolve. And it is not – alas, since we were there at the very beginning – it is not for us as the UK to prescribe a solution in that dispute,"" Johnson said. Baker, MP for Wycombe in south-east England with a large Kashmiri-origin population, has been among the vocal British MPs since the Indian government's revocation of the Article 370 provisions withdrawing the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. He said: ""Thousands of British people in Wycombe have family and friends on one or both sides of the Line of Control in Kashmir. With so many serious allegations of human rights abuses being made, does the government accept that this is not merely some foreign policy issue to be dealt with by others, but that it is an issue of the most and profound concern in Wycombe and in towns across the UK?"" Johnson's response follows Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's statement to the Commons last month when he said that the UK government wanted all allegations of human rights violations in Kashmir since the revocation of Article 370 to be ""thoroughly, promptly and transparently"" investigated. ""We are aware of the implications of the revocation of Article 370. It has caused interest and concern not just within India and Pakistan but amongst communities throughout the UK and internationally. It is a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan but it is also an international issue, given the human rights at stake,"" Raab had said. India abrogated some provisions of the Article 370 in August, bifurcating the state into two union territories. The UK has maintained that it supports a bilateral resolution between India and Pakistan as recognised in the UN Security Council resolutions and the Simla Agreement.

" Opposition parties, some BJP allies attack govt over Kashmir visit of EU MPs | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Opposition parties on Wednesday stepped up their attack against the government over EU MPs' Kashmir trip with the Congress describing it as the ""biggest diplomatic blunder"" and others asking the Centre how these foreign lawmakers were allowed to visit the Valley while Indian leaders were denied permission. It was not just opposition parties that trained their guns on the government over the visit of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to Kashmir, but BJP's ally Shiv Sena also took strong objection to it, asserting that it is ""not an international issue"". In the first visit by a foreign delegation, a team of 23 MEPs travelled to Kashmir on Tuesday on a two-day visit to have a first-hand assessment of the situation after the state's special status was revoked in August by abrogating Article 370. While the Congress asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come forward and answer the issues of ""challenging India's sovereignty, national security and insult of India's Parliament"" by allowing such a visit, CPI questioned why Indian leaders were not allowed to visit teh Valley. CPI general secretary D Raja said he tried to visit Kashmir twice, but was detained and sent back. Even one of the EU MP, Nicolaus Fest, who is part of the delegation, said the government should allow opposition leaders to visit the Valley. Two BJP allies -- the Sena and the JD (U) -- also criticised the government over the visit. Isn't the EU delegation's visit an ""external invasion"" of India's independence and sovereignty? an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' wondered, while questioning the rationale behind allowing the foreign team to visit Jammu and Kashmir. When Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was still criticised for taking the issue to the United Nations (UN), why were the EU parliamentarians allowed to visit Kashmir? the saffron alliance partner asked. However, the Sena, which is an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra, praised the Modi government for having won the fight against ""Pakistan-sponsored terrorism"" by revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370. Raising questions over the government's decision, JD (U) asked is the move not contrary to India's policy against internationalising the issue, and also wondered if it was an appropriate time as even Indian MPs were not allowed to visit the Valley. ""There are several contradictions in the visit. On the one hand India is against internationalising the issue, but on the other hand we have allowed a visit by these parliamentarians in their personal capacity. Is it an appropriate time? What is the criteria for selecting these members,"" JD(U) spokesperson Pavan Varma, a former diplomat, asked. Raja also asked the government to explain the purpose of the visit, and reveal the affiliation of the members of the delegation. Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala claimed that the BJP government continues to humiliate India on a global scale by allowing internationalisation of the Kashmir issue in violation of the time-tested policy that it is India's internal matter. ""The truth is that this is the biggest diplomatic blunder in India's history. The Modi government has deliberately internationalised the Kashmir issue, violating our time tested policy of Kashmir being an internal matter' of India,"" he told reporters. ""The Modi government has committed grave sacrilege by introducing a third party to assess the ground situation in Kashmir and that also through an unknown think tank. By doing so, the government has caused an affront to India's sovereign right over Jammu and Kashmir,"" he added. Over the last three days, he said, India has witnessed ""an immature, ill-advised and ill-conceived PR exercise"" of the BJP government. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra questioned how an ""international business broker"", who is alleged to have organised the private visit of European Union MPs to Kashmir, have access to the Prime Minister's office. She said while the farmers and unemployed youth do not have the facility of meeting the Prime Minister to convey their grievances, ""international business brokers"" facilitate meetings with him. Surjewala claimed the members of European Parliament were brought to India by a ""nondescript"" think-tank with ""questionable"" credentials to meet with Prime Minister Modi, visit Kashmir and hold a press briefing. Surjewala said India's time tested policy over the last 72 years is that Kashmir is an internal issue. ""...We will accept no interference or third party mediation of any nature from any government or group of people or organisation or any individual. The Modi government has committed the gravest sin of reversing this policy over last three days,"" he said. Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram, who is lodged in Tihar jail in the INX Media case, said one does not know that the European MPs may be even invited to attend the next session of Parliament to speak in support of the government. Of the 27 MPs who came to India, 23 went to Kashmir. Several of them belong to right and far right parties and are not part of he mainstream in their own countries.

Congress will work as strong opposition in Haryana: Kumari Selja | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"HISAR: Congress state president Kumari Selja said that the Congress party would play the role of strong opposition in Haryana. The party will raise its voice in a strong way on public issues inside or outside parliament and on the streets. Kumari Selja was addressing a press conference in Hisar on Wednesday. Taking a dig at the BJP and the JJP coalition government, she said that it is an unholy nexus between two conflicting parties. She went on to say that history is witness that whenever such mismatched alliances have been made they have not proven effective and the public has always rejected such alliances. Now it has to be seen how both parties are able to implement the promises made to the public. Selja said that soon Congress membership campaign will be started in the state and elections for the organization will also be conducted. She said that preference in the party will be given to leaders and workers who raise public issues and work at the grassroots. She said that BJP has always done the politics of lies. Their slogan is to lie and move forward. In elections, BJP tried its best to mislead the people of the state through campaigning and other means. Other national issues such as Section 370 and NRC were raised to hide the failures of the five-year tenure by the BJP govt. But the BJP could not understand the pain of any section of Haryana including farmers, laborers, traders, youth, workers, farmers, women. This is the reason that despite all efforts to mislead the people of the state through fake publicity and by other means, the BJP, which won 79 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, found it difficult to get a majority. If the BJP had not got the support of artificial, fake and farcical poll surveys, then the Congress Party would have been in government in the state. Selja said that because of anti-people decisions of the government, the youth are forced to run 250km away from home to appear for entrance exams. This has now been changed since congress had promised exams in home districts and BJP had no option but to copy the promise made by the Congress party. In the case of farmers delay in the process of government purchase of paddy, was anti farmer. This decision of the government has again been reversed after protest. The matter should be investigated as how much paddy was purchased from the farmers of Haryana. She said that our farmers feed the whole country, but under the conspiracy, this government is not allowing these farmers to enter the markets. She said that the Congress party will strongly oppose such anti-people decisions. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

""The government is not allowing an all-party delegation of the country to visit the Valley but is allowing an EU delegation,"" he said. A delegation of 23 European Union MPs visited Kashmir on Tuesday for a first-hand assessment of the situation in the state following the revocation of its special status under Article 370. A large number of people from West Bengal, especially Murshidabad district, are employed in Kashmir, Chowdhury who is a five-time MP from Berhampore in the district, said in his letter to Shah. ""Please ensure safety and security of these people as the family members are unable to connect with them. All the labourers and workers in the valley should return to their homes safely,"" he said in the letter. He also requested Shah to open a helpline so that the family members can get in touch with their near and dear ones who are still in the valley. After meeting family members of the victims, Chowdhury told reporters that he has spoken to Shah over the phone and urged him to make arrangements to bring back the bodies and other labourers from West Bengal from Kashmir. ""The home secretary told me that the DGP of Jammu and Kashmir had a word with his counterpart in West Bengal for sending the bodies to the eastern state,"" Chowdhury said. CPM central committee member Sujan Chakraborty said the union government should be answerable for the deaths of the five labourers. Senior Trinamool Congress leader and state minister Arup Roy too blamed the BJP-led central government for its failure to control the situation in the valley. ""The recent incidents of violence after the abrogation of Article 370 is a proof that the situation has worsened and not improved as promised by the Modi government,"" Roy claimed. A TMC delegation led by Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim will visit the family members of the deceased labourers. West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh criticised the TMC and other parties for ""trying to politicise"" the terrorist attack. ""We condemn the attempts to politicise the incident.

 Article 370: Madi Sharma sent invites to EU delegation. Who is she? | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The   EU delegation’s Kashmir visit   has put the focus on Madi Sharma, the woman and her NGO, Women’s Eco-Nomic and Social Think-Tank (WESTT), who were instrumental in facilitating the trip. Sharma’s official bio on her Twitter handle describes her as ‘Social Capitalist: International Business Broker, Educational Entrepreneur and Speaker’. The invitations to the MEPs seem to have been sent out by Sharma, who promised them a ‘meeting with PM Narendra Modi as well as a visit to Kashmir’. Members of the EU delegation met the Prime Minister, national security adviser Ajit Doval, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar in New Delhi and met Commander of 15th Corps in Srinagar. They were introduced to a cross-section of Kashmiris from parts of civil society at a lunch organised by Doval in New Delhi and at another event in Srinagar. The Madi Group, owned and run by Sharma, is believed to be a network of international private sector, non-profit companies. Sharma is a member of the European Economic and Social Committee, a consultative body of the European Union. She also wrote an article —“Why demolishing Article 370 is both a victory and a challenge for Kashmiri women” — which was published in EP Today, a sponsored publication connected to the European Parliament. According to her website, WESTT is “a leading women’s think-tank with global dimensions, focussing on the economic, environmental and social development of women. At a political level it also lobbies to raise awareness on key issues but never for commercial gain”. But until now, she had not dabbled in affairs related to Kashmir. However, she accompanied a similar EU delegation to Maldives last year when it was still being run by Abdulla Yameen, where they were very critical of the Yameen government.

 Shiv Sena disapproves of EU MPs visit to Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Wednesday took strong objection to the visit by a delegation of European Union (EU) MPs to Kashmir, asserting it is ""not an international issue"". Isn't the EU delegation's visit an ""external invasion"" of India's independence and sovereignty? an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' wondered, while questioning the rationale behind allowing the foreign team to visit Jammu and Kashmir. When Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was still criticised for taking the issue to the United Nations (UN), why were the EU parliamentarians allowed to visit Kashmir? it sought to know. The Sena, which is an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra, however, praised the Modi government for having won the fight against ""Pakistan-sponsored terrorism"" by revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370. A delegation of 23 European Union MPs is on a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir since Tuesday for a first-hand assessment of the situation there following the revocation of the state's special status. Taking a dim view of the foreign delegation's visit, the Sena said, ""Kashmir is not an international issue."" ""Pandit Nehru is still criticized for referring to issue to UN. If you don't want UN intervention, then how do you agree to the EU visit..Isn't the EU delegation's visit an external invasion of India's independence and sovereignty?"" it asked. While a foreign delegation is allowed to visit Kashmir, political party leaders are still barred from entering the area, it noted. ""What is the EU delegation going to do during its visit?"" the Sena asked, and was quick to add that Union home minister (Amit Shah) was capable of answering these questions. The editorial said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah aroused nationalist sentiments with the abrogation of Article 370. ""This is a fight against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and the Modi government has won it,"" it claimed.

The move is seen as a significant shift by the Modi government, indicating a desire to address international opinion over the communication lockdown and detention of political leaders that followed the decision to nullify Article 370. The members of European parliament (MEP) met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and national security adviser Ajit Doval on Monday. The visiting group consists of MEPs from Italy, UK, France, Germany and Poland, and they are on a visit “in their personal capacities”, said sources.

During his meeting with the MPs, the PM called for urgent action against sponsors and supporters of terrorism without naming Pakistan. He said the use of terrorism as state policy must be opposed and added the visit will allow the parliamentarians to get “a better understanding of the cultural and religious diversity of the region of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh”. Modi also said the visit will provide a clear view of the development and governance priorities of the region, according to an official readout. The visit has been organised by the NSA’s office. Last week, a group of US lawmakers had demanded that they be allowed to visit Kashmir. US senator Chris van Hollen, who was in India recently, complained that he had not been allowed to go. The MEPs also met Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu while Doval spent almost an hour providing a detailed briefing on the situation. External affairs minister S Jaishankar met them at dinner on Monday evening. The EU parliamentarians will travel to Srinagar on Tuesday morning, where they are expected to meet civil society and the administration. The development saw opposition parties Congress and CPI(M) criticising the government for facilitating the visit by EU parliamentarians while keeping the state off-limits for Indian politicians. Doval told the MEPs there were no restrictions on movement, and all landline and postpaid mobiles are functional in J&K. Hospitals were functioning too and essential supplies were available, despite the ever-present terror threat. The Europeans met a large number of Kashmiris at the lunch hosted by Doval and these included some newly elected panchayat leaders, political activists and business people. Sources said European countries were becoming India-Pakistan battleground with the Pakistani diaspora in many of these countries sponsoring action, both political and legal, against India. The Indian effort is to reduce the space for such political activism by reaching out to political forces that are willing to understand why India altered the status of J&K. India had to embark on a massive diplomatic initiative in Europe last month, as Pakistan and its supporters used the UNHRC to target India. The MEPs’ visit comes a few days before the reorganisation of J&K comes into formal effect. The government, in its conversation with the European lawmakers, assured them that the detention of political leaders would be reconsidered along with a roadmap for a delimitation exercise and ultimately elections in the territories. Until then, the Centre needed to be in control in J&K to help transition the government machinery in the state to become a full-fledged state.

 Having an enclave within country not desirable: Venkaiah Naidu to EU lawmakers on J&amp;K | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu asserted on Monday that scraping the special status accorded to Jammu and Kashmir was a step towards equality and said there was a wide belief that having an ""enclave within the country"" was not desirable. Interacting with a group of European Union lawmakers here a day before their visit to Jammu and Kashmir, he said the resolution to scrap provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution were put to vote in Parliament on August 5 and 6 and it received ""unequivocal mandate"" of both the Houses. ""The Lower House (Lok Sabha) voted 80 per cent in favour and in the Upper House (Rajya Sabha), nearly 66 per cent supported...,"" a statement issued by the vice-president's secretariat said quoting Naidu. He also said that abrogation of Article 370 was an internal matter and the move to bifurcate the state into two union territories was to ensure the overall development of both Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. ""Abrogation of Article 370 was a step towards equity and human dignity. Naidu observed that the move would ensure good governance where people enjoy the fruits of freedom rather than be constantly under the fear of the bullet,"" the statement said. Provisions under Article 370 according special status was intended to be a transitory provision from the beginning, he told the EU lawmakers. ""He said that it was widely felt that having an enclave within the country was not desirable and was seen as antithetical to an inclusive growth strategy where the country aims to bridge development gaps between states and achieve an equitable growth leaving no state behind,"" the statement said. Stating that Jammu and Kashmir was beset with a host of formidable impeding challenges such as corruption, lack of accountability, growing threat of militancy and cross-border terrorism along with slow development, the vice president said that the situation in the state after 70 years of independence convinced the policymakers that they could not allow the rapid downslide to continue. He said that the government, therefore, had to take the best possible steps for preventing any loss of life or property. The vice president said that it was to the credit of the government that these measures have succeeded in full, as not a single bullet has been fired till date and there has not been any loss of life on account of any police firing. He said that the restrictions were only temporary in character and relaxations were being given step by step and stage by stage. The vice-president also told the delegation that several steps have been taken by the government to ensure smooth flow of information in Jammu and Kashmir. Referring to the recently held first-ever elections to Block Development Councils, he said that 98.3 per cent voter turnout was an indicator for a very peaceful election. The vice president said that India wishes to see a more just, peaceful and responsive world order and that it was building a richly diverse, harmonious, democratic polity to ensure all-round development and inclusive growth. Naidu told the EU delegation that India believes that peace was the pre-requisite for progress and the government wishes to bring peace to troubled areas, so that people enjoy a better quality of life.

" European lawmakers to visit Kashmir; PM Modi, NSA Doval brief them on situation | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: In the first visit by a foreign delegation to Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370, a group of 27 European lawmakers will travel there on Tuesday, a major diplomatic outreach by the government to counter Pakistan's narrative on the situation in the valley and to give them a ""clear view"" of India's development and governance priorities. Ahead of their two-day Kashmir visit, these members of   European Parliamentarians (MEPs) also met Prime Minister  Narendra Modi, who categorically told them that an urgent action was needed against those supporting and sponsoring terrorism. The visit will provide them with a better understanding of the cultural and religious diversity of the regions of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, Modi said and hoped that it will also give them a ""clear view"" of the development and governance priorities in the region, according to an official release. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval also briefed MEPs, who are from nine countries, on cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan, constitutional changes made in the status of Jammu and Kashmir with the revocation of Article 370 and the situation in the valley. After the briefing, Doval hosted a lunch for the European lawmakers. Those present also included some Kashmiri leaders, including former deputy chief minister of J&K Muzaffar Baig, former People's Democratic Party (PDP) leader Altaf Bukhari, some newly-elected Block Development Council (BDC) members in the state as also Sandeep Chattoo, co-owner of Real Kashmir Football Club. However, the initiative was strongly criticised by opposition parties with the Congress attacking the government, saying while it is allowing MEPs to visit J&K but preventing Indian leaders from doing so which was an insult to India's democracy and ""ultimate disrespect"" to its sovereignty. Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, who is in detention, tweeted, ""Hope they get a chance to speak to the people, local media, doctors and civil society members. The iron curtain between Kashmir & the world needs to be lifted and GOI must be held accountable for pushing J&K into turmoil"" while questioning Centre's decision not to allow US senators. Tweeting on behalf of Mehbooba Mufti, her family said,""Won't be surprised if GOIs indulging in normalcy acrobatics again & orchestrating 'normalcy' certificates."" Criticising the outreach, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy tweeted, ""I am surprised that the MEA has arranged for European Union MPs, in their private capacity (not EU's official delegation), to visit Kashmir area of J&K. This is a perversion of our national policy. I urge the Government cancel this visit because it is immoral.""

""We remain concerned about the situation on the ground, with its restrictions on fundamental freedoms. It is crucial that freedom of movement and means of communication are fully restored as well as access to all essential services. ""The high representative conveyed these concerns to the Indian minister for external affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, during their meeting in Brussels on 30 August,""said Tytti Tuppurainen, Finnish minister for European Affairs on behalf of high representative/vice-president Federica Mogherini on September 18. However, officials here feel the visit will provide an opportunity to these lawmakers to ""see things for themselves"" instead of falling prey to Pakistan's ""false narrative"". As per sources, the delegation will meet J&K administration officials and locals in the valley. During the two-day visit, they are also likely to call on the governor and interact with the media. The delegation includes Italy's Fulvio Martusciello, UK's David Richard Bull, Italy's Gianna Gancia, France's Julie Lechanteux, Czech Republic's Tomas Zdechovsky, Slovakia's Peter Pollak and Germany's Nicolas Fest. ""It (abrogation of Article 370) is India's internal matter as Kashmir is its part. It is the prerogative of Indian government to take internal decisions. We are with India on this,"" Zdechovsky told PTI. In his article in the European Parliament's monthly newspaper last month, Zdechovsky said the abrogation of Article 370 will help in rooting out several terrorist organisations operating in Kashmir. ""Following the article, I received many hate mails from Pakistan,"" he said. Advocating an approach of dialogue, Pollak said, ""Both India and Pakistan should talk to avoid escalation in the region."" Another lawmaker said the briefing by Doval was very ""informative"" and gave a perspective on the entire issue. Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said the party would raise issue in Parliament as, he added, the government decision violates the collective privileges of Indian MPs. Inviting EU lawmakers to JK is the ""ultimate disrespect"" to Indian Parliament's sovereignty, Sharma added. His party colleague Jairam Ramesh tweeted,""When Indian political leaders have been prevented from meeting the people of J&K, what possessed the great chest-beating champion of nationalism to allow European politicians to visit J&K. This is an outright insult to India's own Parliament and our democracy.""

Last week, a US Congressional panel questioned state department officials on the situation in Kashmir with some lawmakers expressing concern over the situation. As many as six US lawmakers -- David Cicilline, Dina Titus, Andy Levin, Susan Wild, Chrissy Houlahan, and James McGovern -- also wrote a letter to Indian Ambassador to the US Harsh Vardhan Shringla, claiming that the picture portrayed by India in the valley is different from the one being told to them by their constituents. ""We believe true transparency can only be achieved when journalists and members of Congress are allowed free access to the region. We encourage India to open Jammu and Kashmir to both domestic and foreign journalists, and other international visitors, in the interest of open media and increased communication,"" they said in the letter.

 Left parties: Why foreign delegation allowed in J&amp;K while Indian political parties prevented | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: CPM general-secretary Sitaram Yechury on Monday questioned why members of the European Parliament were being ""welcomed"" in Jammu and Kashmir when Indian political leaders had been prevented from doing so. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday told a delegation of European Union MPs that urgent action was needed against those supporting and sponsoring terrorism. The delegation is scheduled to visit the state on Tuesday. ""Then why were Indian political party leaders and MPs repeatedly prevented from exiting Srinagar airport? I was allowed to enter Srinagar only when the Supreme Court permitted over my habeas corpus petition. Even today Indian MPs are not allowed while Modi welcomes MEPs!,"" Yechury tweeted. Yechury and CPI general secretary D Raja were not allowed to visit the state after the abrogation of Article 370 despite repeated attempts. Yechury was allowed to visit his ailing party colleague Yusuf Tarigami after the SC gave its go ahead on the condition that he would not be part of any political activity there. ""The fact that the Indian government is facilitating the visit of the EU delegation shows that this government is desperate and is under pressure to please the international community which has raised several questions on human rights violations in J&K. The government is desperate to convince the global community. While it says everything is normal in the region, the ground reality is different,"" said Raja. CPI leader Atul Anjaan alleged that PM Modi was trying to ""internationalise"" the Kashmir issue by welcoming the delegation of the European Union.

 PDP leaders seek fresh permission to meet detained party president Mehbooba Mufti | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: The Peoples Democratic Party leadership in Jammu on Monday sought a fresh permission from the governor administration to meet detained party president Mehbooba Mufti in Srinagar, a party leader said. The governor administration had earlier given permission to a delegation of the PDP leaders to meet the former chief minister but the party deferred the proposed visit following serious differences within its camp over the visit. ""Senior PDP leaders met and decided to seek a fresh permission from the concerned authorities to meet the party president,"" senior party functionary and former legislator Ved Mahajan said. Accordingly, he said, a letter was sent to the deputy commissioner, Srinagar, to seek his permission for a deputation of Jammu-based leaders, including former legislators, to visit Mufti on October 30. Mufti, along with other prominent mainstream leaders in the Valley, have been under detention since August 5 when the Centre abrogated Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcated the state into two Union territories. Mahajan, who was authorised to seek the formal permission from the authorities, said the composition of the delegation would be decided only after the permission is granted. On October 6, the PDP announced that it had got permission from Governor Satya Pal Malik to visit Mufti, but within hours deferred the visit after several senior leaders came out in open and challenged the authority of those who had sought the permission from the administration at that time. They attacked Mahajan, who was in the forefront at that time as well, for ""sidelining"" them while taking such an important decision. They also accused Mahajan and others of following the footsteps of the National Conference, a delegation of which had visited Srinagar and met detained party president Farooq Abdullah and vice president Omar Abdullah on the same day -- October 6.

Not a single bullet had to be fired, not a single life is lost; Kashmir is peacefully on the path of progress.” The home minister said that shortly after being elected for the second time, PM Narendra Modi fulfilled Sardar Patel’s unfulfilled dream. “Sardar Patel formed India by integrating 629 provinces but Kashmir could never be completely integrated into India due to Article 370 and Article 35A. After the abrogation of these articles, Narendrabhai totally integrated Kashmir with India.

Shah also said that the 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Patel in Kevadiya, is a befitting compensation to ‘70 years of insult to Sardar’. “Today, when you see Sardar Patel’s statue touching the sky at Kevadiya, you realise how there was a gross injustice to Sardar for 70 long years.

"'Separating Jharkhand from Maharashtra, Haryana polls to aid BJP' | Ranchi News - Times of India","RANCHI: BJP is pinning hope on a series of events ahead of the polls in Jharkhand after the Thursday road bump that the party experienced in terms of performance in Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections. The leaders apparently took a sigh of relief over their own decision to go solo instead of going to the polls, along with the two states, the results of which have thrown surprise to the NDA. One of the senior BJP leaders told TOI that after a lot of brainstorming, the state unit had voted against the idea of going for the polls with Haryana and Maharashtra. ""It was a well-calculated decision because the party which talks of one nation one election theory was expected to dissolve the Jharkhand assembly and go for the polls in October only, given the fact that term of Jharkhand assembly was expiring within two months by December 27,"" the senior party leader said justifying their internal calculation and recommendation to the centre accordingly. Spokesperson Jharkhand state BJP Pratul Shahdeo said that since the elections in Maharashtra and Haryana are over the central leaders and ministers are now free and can focus exclusively on Jharkhand. ""We wanted the Central leaders to be able to dedicate their time and energy for Jharkhand and now confident that even the prime minister would be able to address people ahead of the elections,"" he said. Party insiders also believe that the elections result of these two states are litmus test for the continuation of Modi magic in the country. BJP leaders admit that the same magic wand is not effective when it comes to state politics and accordingly, they must retune their campaign strategy. ""Some of the regional issues like Bharat Ratna to Savarkar in Maharashtra and in Haryana went ahead with the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to incite nationalist feelings but apparently both the models did not cut much ice with the voters and they gave chance to alternates like NCP and JJP in Maharashtra and Haryana respectively which is an eye opener for us,"" a party member said on condition of anonymity. Party's state general secretary Deepak Prakash however sounded upbeat and said the BJP's permanent slogan is related to development and nationalism which would remain the cardinal points of its campaign strategy in Jharkhand as well. ""Everyone takes lessons from success and failure and we are no exception but the election results have merely reminded us to remain vigilant,"" he added.

""In 2014, the people of the country decided for a change and a full majority government of the BJP was formed. Narendrabhai became PM of the country, and within five years, Modi and the BJP government ensured these facilities were provided,"" he said, mentioning schemes like Ayushman Bharat, toilets, LPG gas cylinders under Ujjwala etc. ""The opposition criticises us, which I welcome, but I would like to ask them why, despite four generations ruling this nation, they failed to provide amenities to people,"" he said. The Congress made fun of toilets as a parameter of development because those born with silver spoons in their mouths cannot understand the pain in a poor household without toilets, gas cylinders etc, Shah said. ""Narendrabhai was born and brought up in a poor family, so he understood the pain of the poor since childhood.

""This is no sign of 'normalcy.' Independents won 217 and BJP only 81, mainly from Jammu. Modi, as usual is resorting to falsehoods and propaganda,"" he said. The prime minister had said,""I once again congratulate MPs across party lines for the historic decisions on J&K. It would make India's Parliament proud that due to their historic decision in August this year, the people of J&K have been able to exercise their democratic right with exceptional enthusiasm, as seen in the historic turnout of 98% that too without violence or disturbance.""

" J&amp;K, Ladakh to get equitable benefits: Union minister | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Union minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday said the two new Union territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh - which will come into existence next week, will get equitable benefits, cutting across all sections of the society and regions without any bias. He said over the last seven decades, a constant grievance across the state was that certain regions and sections of people were feeling discriminated against. While Jammu always complained about the lion's share going to the Kashmir valley, Ladakh too felt neglected, the minister said. ""As a Union Territory, Jammu and Kashmir will get equitable benefits after October 31, cutting across all sections of the society and regions, regardless of any extraneous considerations. The same would also apply to the Union Territory of Ladakh,"" he told reporters here, ahead of the formal bifurcation of the state. The Centre had, on August 5, announced abrogation of the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcation of the state into Union territories, which will come into being on October 31. Singh, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, said even in the Kashmir valley, while ""certain families made a quick fortune overnight without any known sources of proportionate income"", the common man suffered in silence and was caught between terrorism on one hand and ""state indifference"" on the other. The Union minister for the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said since the UT of Jammu and Kashmir will come directly under the control of the Union home ministry, there will not only be an equal distribution of government resources, but also accountability for the same. He said one of the greatest misfortunes of Jammu and Kashmir was the lack of transparency in governance and this too would gradually change for the better. ""The needless interference in the maintenance of law and order and the role of the vested interests would also gradually recede,"" he said. The most important benefit, Singh said, would be the change in the psychological attitude and mindset of the people of the region, with a greater degree of self- confidence and sense of belonging as citizens of India. The benefits in terms of new breakthrough in higher education, professional colleges, industry and self-livelihood opportunities were going to gradually unfold with the passage of time and their ultimate magnitude was perhaps too difficult to imagine right now, he added. At the social level, particularly for women, the ""medieval legacy"" would end with the introduction of progressive laws such as those banning triple talaq, child marriage and dowry, in addition to the right to parental property, which already stood restored after the abrogation of Article 370, the minister said.

"Delhi: For assembly polls, BJP leaders to lay focus on local issues | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: With the assembly polls in Haryana and Maharashtra not giving very encouraging results, Delhi BJP has decided to lay emphasis on local issues during the interaction of party leaders with the electorate as a part of their campaign for the elections due early next year. When Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari spent Thursday night with the people of Shashi Garden in east Delhi’s Patparganj, the discussion largely revolved around basic amenities, such as availability of drinking water, health facilities in government hospitals, education, pucca houses for slum dwellers, among other issues. This was Tiwari’s 22nd night stay in a jhuggi basti since he became the president of Delhi BJP and third after his re-election as North East Delhi MP. The night stays are a part of his outreach programme during which he has dinner and breakfast with the residents of the slum clusters. In a video tweet posted from Shashi Garden, Tiwari said the residents of the area were forced to drink contaminated water. “We are taking feedback from the slum residents on basic amenities available to them and if the incumbent Delhi government has provided them the facilities promised in the last elections. We are going to the areas where the city’s poor live to understand issues related to law and order, women’s safety and basic civic amenities,” Tiwari said, adding that he will spend nights at more such colonies in the next few weeks. BJP has decided to send more senior leaders to slum clusters and unauthorised colonies in the next few weeks keeping the assembly polls in mind. After Haryana elections, the party leadership wants the state unit to have more connect with people on ground. While the central government schemes would be a part of the discussion and the leaders may also touch upon national issues, such as abrogation of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the focus will remain on Delhi-specific issues. After the Centre’s announcement related to regularisation of unauthorised colonies, BJP functionaries will also interact with people living in such localities. “Every office bearer of Delhi BJP has been asked to light diyas in at least 200 houses in unauthorised colonies on October 26 and 27. They will also explain to the residents how the Centre’s decision to regularise colonies is going to benefit them,” said a party functionary.

 Plea in SC by Kashmiri Pandits supporting abrogation of Article 370 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Two Kashmiri Pandits and an apex body of various associations formed by the community have moved the Supreme Court in support of the government's decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The plea by Tej Kumar Moza, Karishma Tej Kumar Moza and All India Kashmiri Samaj, seeking to be made parties in the ongoing matter, said that Article 370 was a transitory provision that was enacted keeping in mind the peculiar situation of Jammu and Kashmir and to enable it to completely integrate into the Union of India. It categorically provides power to the President to cease the operation of the Article through a public notification, the plea said. ""It is therefore submitted that the formulations and notifications of the 2019 order is in consonance with the provisions of Article 370 and the 2019 amendment act is a consequential legislative action that flows from it,"" the plea said. ""The Treaty of Accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Republic of India was an unconditional one and it was always the intention of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to be completed integrated with the Republic of India. Article 370 was a temporary provision inserted with the object of peace, security, law and order in the State,"" the plea filed by All India Kashmiri Samaj said. The petition also stated that Jammu and Kashmir has been consistently threatened by infiltration from Pakistan and China with frequent incidents of cross-border radicalism and terrorism. The apex court has fixed November 14 to commence hearing on a batch of petitions challenging constitutional validity of the Centre's decision to abrogate Article 370 provisions. A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice N V Ramana had allowed the Centre and the Jammu and Kashmir administration to file counter-affidavits on petitions challenging scrapping of Article 370. Several political parties including the National Conference (NC), the Sajjad Lone-led J&K Peoples Conference and CPI (M) leader Mohd Yousuf Tarigami have filed pleas, challenging the Centre's August 5 decision. The petition on behalf of the NC was filed by Lok Sabha MPs Mohammad Akbar Lone and Justice (retd) Hasnain Masoodi. In 2015, Justice (retd) Masoodi had ruled that Article 370 was a permanent feature of the Constitution. A plea was also filed by a group of former defence officers and bureaucrats- Radha Kumar, ex-member of Home Ministry's Group of Interlocutors for J&K (2010-11), former J&K cadre IAS officer Hindal Haidar Tyabji, Air Vice Marshal (retd) Kapil Kak, Major Gen.

"No pre-conditions for joining BJP, says Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MLA Kunal Sarangi | Jamshedpur News - Times of India","JAMSHEDPUR: “I have joined BJP to serve people,” said Baharagora MLA Kunal Sarangi on Friday. Talking to TOI, Kunal said Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) should have never joined hands with Congress in the recent Lok Sabha polls adding that it spelt doom for the party. He said Congress is a sinking ship as it had failed to give proper leadership both at the national and state level. The NIT graduate from Jamshedpur and MBA from Lancaster University, hitting out at JMM said, “In the recent times it has failed to play the role of a constructive opposition.” Kunal said one should not oppose policies of the ruling party just as we are sitting in the opposition’s chair, while referring to JMM’s stand against Modi government’s policies on revoking of Article 370 in Kashmir or boycotting the special session in the new assembly building in Jharkhand. He said JMM had insulted the masses of Jharkhand by boycotting the new assembly building. Kunal replying to a question said there are no pre-conditions from his side in connection with joining the saffron camp. He said it is up to the BJP high command to decide whether he will get a ticket from Baharagora seat. The son of three-time BJP MLA from Baharagora Dinesh Sarangi, Kunal also refuted the posts in social media that his mother will be offered the Odisha governor’s post if he joins BJP. He said it is fake news adding that he had joined the party due to growing ideological differences with JMM and it’s working president Hemant Soren over several issues. Replying to another question Kunal said in the 2014 assembly polls BJP had given Baharagora ticket to Dineshanand Goswami, so he joined JMM and contested from the seat on it’s ticket. He pointed at the growing one-upmanship in JMM adding that a core committee was formed after the Lok Sabha polls to study the party’s debacle but till date not a single meeting has been held. Meanwhile, JMM functionaries close Kunal said distance between the party and the MLA sparked off after he was denied JMM’s ticket from the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha seat in the recent polls. The ticket was given to old war horse Champai Soren, who was defeated by sitting BJP MP Bdiyut Baran Mahato by a record margin. Sources said Kunal had then made up his mind that he will go to the party from which his father had been a three-time MLA. Sources pointed out that of late Kunal had met CM Raghubar Das and had often publicly praised the policies of Modi government. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Article 370’s emotive appeal fails to click with voters | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Muscular nationalism, as reflected in the abrogation of Article 370 in August, was the focus of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah’s belligerent election campaign in Haryana and Maharashtra. Taking their cue from the top, BJP candidates often began their speeches chanting ‘Bharat Ki Mata Jai’ and hailing the government’s “bold and decisive” move in Jammu & Kashmir. Complete coverage: Maharashtra, Haryana electionsBut politicians and social scientists say that it hasn’t worked, at least to the extent that BJP wanted. Devendra Fadnavis dodges quota bullet, but Jat backlash trips Khattar“Voters weren’t moved by emotive issues such as abrogation of Article 370 which were not relevant to the polls. But it is also true that they weren’t moved much by non-emotive issues such as unemployment either,” says political scientist Imtiaz Ahmad. Social scientist Yogendra Yadav, whose Swaraj India party also contested the polls, says one conclusion which can be drawn from the polls is that nationalism cannot be peddled in state elections. “BJP seemed to believe that you can distract the electorate with issues that had nothing to do with governance. That idea has been neutralised,” he says. Live updates: Maharashtra, Haryana government formationYadav also recounted his own experience. “Haryana is a state full of Armymen. I travelled there for one month and addressed about 100 election meetings. Nobody got up to ask me about Article 370. There is undoubtedly popular support for the abrogation, but it was not a relevant election issue,” he said. Sociologist Shakuntala Nandal feels that BJP’s focus on these issues went against the party. “BJP ignored local grievances such as unemployment, women’s safety, farmer’s woes,” says Nandal, who works in Desh Bandhu Govt College, Panipat. Speaking off the record, a BJP functionary admitted that the outcome in Haryana showed that the “micro issues” played a role in the party’s below-par performance. He also felt the wide margin between the party’s vote share in the Lok Sabha elections and these assembly elections show that voters are driven by different factors in different elections, and BJP’s effort to frame every contest around issues like nationalism to subsume local bread and butter issues may not always work. Another party leader, who did not wish to be named, said that agrarian issues and large-scale defection of opposition leaders to BJP may have worked against the party’s interests in Maharashtra. But he also wondered whether the outcome would have been worse if the party had not focused on emotive issues such as Kashmir. According to Yadav, the poll outcome suggested a continuity of the state elections held in MP, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan last year and Haryana and Maharashtra now. “In all these elections, the governments were reprimanded for non-performance in different degrees on matters of economy, largely in rural areas. The Lok Sabha poll was different where national issues, including national security, dominated.” He further said, “In political science, we talk about self-correcting mechanisms of democracy. The market tends to correct itself, so does democracy. At the national level, the verdict brings some relief to many. BJP and Shiv Sena have come back to power in Maharashtra and they still might form the Haryana government. But the big message is that the BJP is not invincible.” Yadav also said, “I was among those who believed that governance record and electoral outcome have been delinked. Fortunately, there seems to be a link. Manohar Lal Khattar government’s performance was less than mediocre. Haryana had a huge public debt. It more than doubled in these five years…BJP had promised elimination of unemployment. Haryana is No 1 in terms of unemployment in the country. The government did not even look after law and order. The state saw three major meltdowns: the Baba Rampal confrontation, the Jat agitation and the Dera Sacha Sauda agitation. BJP has been punished for misgovernance.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Onus for peace talks between India and Pakistan lies with Islamabad: US | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The onus for peace talks between India and Pakistan lies with Islamabad which has to take ""sustained and irreversible actions"" against terror groups, a senior US official has said, reiterating President Donald Trump's willingness to mediate on the Kashmir issue, only if asked by both the countries. India has not been engaging with Pakistan since an attack on the Air Force base at Pathankot in January of 2016 by a Pakistan-based terror group, maintaining that talks and terror cannot go together. Bilateral relations touched a new low when India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August following which Pakistan downgraded the diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian envoy. The State Department official said the US will continue to encourage an atmosphere that allows for constructive Indo-Pak dialogue. President Trump has expressed his concern over the level of tension between India and Pakistan. And he discussed Kashmir directly in his meetings with Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Imran Khan, the official said on condition of anonymity. ""He (Trump) certainly is prepared to play a mediation role, if both the countries ask. It has been India's position not to seek outside mediation,"" the official said. If the President is asked to mediate by both countries, he has expressed his willingness and his interests to help facilitate a solution, the official told a group of reporters when pressed further. India has been quite clear in Prime Minister Modi's office saying that they are not seeking mediation, the official said. India has always maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is its integral part and ruled out any third party mediation, including either from the UN or the US, saying it is a bilateral issue with Pakistan. However, the official said it does not mean that the US is not actively encouraging a dialogue to take place and that an atmosphere for constructive dialogue between the two countries be established. The onus for peace talks between India and Pakistan lies with Islamabad by taking sustained and irreversible actions against terrorist groups, according to the official. The official termed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Kartarpur Corridor a welcome confidence building measure between India and Pakistan which will help increase people-to-people contact. India and Pakistan on Thursday signed the historic agreement on the Kartarpur corridor that will allow Indian pilgrims to undertake visa-free visit to the shrine of the Sikh religion's founder Guru Nanak Dev in Pakistan. ""While it's a small step, we need more like this to also create the will, the goodwill and the environment for constructive dialogue,"" the official said. Asked if the US supports India's position that ""talks and terror cannot go together"", the official said it is important that Pakistan take ""sustainable and irreversible steps against terrorism"". It is also possible to have a dialogue and the United States encourages the countries to engage as two nuclear powers living side by side, the official said. ""When you have two nuclear powers ... it is important that your all avenues be explored to increase contact and communication between the two sides, the official said, adding that President Trump is engaged with leaders of both the countries. Referring to the 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston in September, the official said this demonstrated the very close partnership and friendship that the US has with India. ""The India-US strategic partnership has been growing over the last two and a half years. It is obviously part of a longer bipartisan two decade's of effort to improve relations with India that has now reached a stage of confidence and maturity,"" the official added.

" Kashmir: Normal life continues to be hit for 82nd day, Jamia Masjid remains closed | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: Normal life continued to remain affected in the Kashmir Valley as the historic Jamia Masjid in the Nowhatta area of the city here remained closed for congregational prayers for the 12th consecutive on Friday, officials said. The gates of the Jamia Masjid were shut and security forces' personnel were deployed in strength in the area, they said. Friday prayers have not been allowed at any of the major mosques or shrines, including the Jamia Masjid in Nowhatta, in the Valley for the past more than two months now. Authorities have been imposing restrictions in vulnerable areas every Friday in view of apprehensions that vested interests might exploit the huge Friday prayer gatherings at big mosques and shrines to fuel protests. However, the officials said there were no restrictions anywhere in the Valley. Meanwhile, normal life remained affected across Kashmir as the stalemate, following the abrogation of Article 370 provisions, continued for the 82nd consecutive day on Friday, the officials said. Main markets and other business establishments were shut across the Valley, even as some shops opened for a few hours early in the morning in some areas, including in the commercial hub of Lal Chowk in the city here, but downed their shutters around 11 am, the officials said. Private transport was plying, but the number of vehicles was lesser on Friday than Thursday, the officials said. Auto-rickshaws and a few inter-district cabs were also seen plying in few areas of the Valley, they added. However, the other modes of public transport were off the roads. Internet services across all platforms continued to be snapped in the Valley since the night of August 4 hours before the Centre announced its decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into union territories, the officials said. The internet services were snapped along with mobile and landline telephone services. While the landline telephone services were restored gradually first, the postpaid mobile services were restored only last week. The prepaid services continued to remain barred. Schools and colleges were open but students stayed away as parents continued to keep their wards at home due to apprehensions about their safety, the officials said. Most of the top-level and second-rung separatist politicians have been taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders, including two former chief ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, have been either detained or placed under house arrest. Another former chief minister and sitting Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar, Farooq Abdullah has been arrested under the controversial Public Safety Act, a law enacted by his father and National Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978 when he was the chief minister.

"Maharashtra: Rebirth for Cong-NCP, wake-up call for BJP | Nagpur News - Times of India","NAGPUR: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena suffered a loss of at least 14 seats in Vidarbha bringing down its tally in the region from last time’s 48 to 34. The slide is being seen as a setback for regional satraps, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who had campaigned intensively in the region setting a target of winning over 50 seats. In their home turf of Nagpur district, BJP suffered major reverses losing four seats in rural and two in city. Nagpur West was wrested by Congress after a gap of 30 years. City Congress president Vikas Thakre was third time lucky as he won the West seat defeating two-term BJP MLA Sudhakar Deshmukh. More impressive was comeback of Congress in Nagpur North where its former minister and important Dalit leader Nitin Raut managed to defeat sitting Congress MLA Dr Milind Mane by over 16,000 votes. Congress -NCP got a major boost in the region winning 20 seats, up from 11 last time. The saffron parties’ losing grip on the region also put a question mark on prime minister Narendra Modi’s magic and that of party chief Amit Shah’s winning ways. Modi addressed two public rallies in the region while Shah appeared at half a dozen places. Modi wave that apparently worked until six months ago in Lok Sabha elections was on the wane. The narrative of Article 370 failed to impress voters and in several constituencies they expressed their ire against the ruling parties by pressing NOTA button. Among the BJP losers was agriculture minister Anil Bonde. Over confidence of BJP proved to be its undoing. The large number of rebels contesting against official candidates of saffron alliance was another major cause for it failing to retain seats. Among the rebels who cost the BJP heavily were Vinod Agarwal in Gondia who defeated BJP’s official candidate Gopaldas Agarwal. The latter was left repenting the decision of switching over from Congress to the BJP at the last minute in the hope of achieving lifetime aspiration of becoming a minister. Ashish Jaiswal, the Sena rebel from Ramtek, registered protest over him being denied ticket by contesting against BJP sitting MLA Mallikarjun Reddy and winning it by a margin of 25,000 votes as Udaysinh Yadav of Congress came a poor third. Nana Patole of Congress managed to win from Sakoli in Bhandara district defeating Parinay Fuke in a close tussle with Sevak Waghaye, a former Congress MLA fighting as Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi candidate, eating away over 30,000 votes. Prakash Ambedkar-led Aghadi came close to opening its account from Murtizapur in Akola district where its candidate Pratibha Awachar was trailing by wafer thin margin of 35 seats against sitting BJP MLA Harish Pimple. The result was put on hold as Awachar demanded a recount. Similarly in Risod constituency in Washim district, sitting Congress MLA sought VVPAT count as six EVMs malfunctioned during counting. He was leading by 2200 votes against a party rebel Anantrao Deshmukh and the result was awaited. Among prominent losers of the BJP, Bonde was defeated by Devendra Bhuyar from Morshi in Amravati. Bhuyar is Swabhimani Shetkari Paksh candidate supported by the Congress-NCP. Maverick politician Bacchu Kadu won yet again from Achalpur while his Prahar Janshakti Party colleague Rajkumar Patel won from Melghat seat defeating Congress party’s Kewalram Kale in ST reserved seat.

"Results of Maharashtra, Haryana elections: What could save the day for BJP | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The BJP-Shiv Sena combine romped home to a second consecutive term in Maharashtra and emerged as the single largest party in Haryana. However, its seat share has reduced in both states in the present polls as compared with the 2014 assembly elections. In the 2014 Maharashtra assembly election, when BJP and Shiv Sena contested separately, the former won 122 of the 288 seats while Shiv Sena was victorious on 63. Together, they bagged 185 seats. However, they won lesser number of seats this year. While BJP was victorious on 105 of the 164 seats it contested Shiv Sena bagged 56 of the 124 it fought. Together they have 161 seats, down 24 seats than its 2014 tally. In the 2014 Haryana assembly election, BJP emerged a clear winner, registering victory on 47 of the total 90 seats. However, in this year’s election, BJP won 40 seats, down seven seats and six less than the majority mark. BJP seems to have faced troubles on certain fronts. Under Amit Shah, BJP experimented with caste equations in Maharashtra and Haryana. In Maharashtra where the Marathas dominate politics, Devendra Fadnavis, a Brahmin, headed the government. Similarly in Haryana, which is dominated by the Jats, Khattar, a Punjabi, led the government. Though the party appears to have got a large chunk of the votes of the non-Marathas in Maharashtra and non-Jats in Haryana, the Maratha and Jat vote in the respective states seem to have consolidated against BJP. However the party would have fared worse if not for these factors that favoured Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah: Modi waveIn some respects, the 2019 assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana are similar to the 2014 elections in both states. These were the first two states to go to the polls after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The Modi wave was then still intact. Riding on the wave, BJP-Shiv Sena combine defeated the Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra and won a majority in Haryana. This election witnessed a similar phenomenon. BJP won a big mandate in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, bagging 303 seats overall. The momentum of that win seems to have impacted results in Maharashtra and Haryana. CampaigningBJP launched a powerful campaign in both the states led by PM Modi and Amit Shah. Both addressed rallies till the last day of campaigning on October 19. They also had Maharashtra and Haryana chief ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal Khattar campaigning in their respective states. In contrast, Congress’s campaign was low key. Party president Sonia Gandhi did not hold a single rally in either state - her rally at Mahendragarh on October 18 was cancelled at the last moment. Her son and predecessor Rahul Gandhi addressed the rally in her place. RalliesBJP’s campaign was far more impactful than that of its rivals. The top BJP leaders addressed more rallies than their rivals. In fact, both PM Modi and Amit Shah had addressed rallies in both states even before the Election Commission announced the poll schedule on September 21. After September 21 when the dates were announced, while Rahul Gandhi addressed just two election rallies in Haryana and five in Maharashtra, PM Modi and Amit Shah held seven rallies each in the northern state alone. In Maharashtra, while Modi addressed nine rallies, Shah held 19. Altogether, they addressed 42 rallies in the two states against seven by Rahul Gandhi. NationalismNationalism has been the mainstay of BJP’s campaign, with the party reaping rich dividends. While air strikes in Balakot in response to the terror attack in Pulwama helped BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, nullification of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution bolstered the party’s chances in the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections. Besides, Amit Shah also announced that the Modi government would implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC) throughout the country by 2024. The unprovoked firing by Pakistan and India’s strong response on the eve of elections may have also played a role in weaning away votes in favour of the BJP. On the other hand, Congress relied on economic slowdown and jobs as its main election planks. As in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi continued his attack on the Modi government over issues such as alleged corruption in the Rafale fighter aircraft deal and “undue favours” to businessmen such as Ambanis, Adanis, Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, which failed to find favour with voters. Double-engine governmentsFor the 2014 assembly elections, both Narendra Modi and Amit Shah had sought votes on the slogan of “double-engine” governments -- a BJP-led dispensation at the Centre and in the state for faster growth. They claimed “double engine” or “double decker” governments had helped n “double engine growth”. The voters of Maharashtra and Haryana bought the argument in 2014 and it seems to have appealed to them this time round as well. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Private construction work in full swing in Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Private construction work is in full bloom in Kashmir but the exodus of non-local labourers after the abrogation of Article 370 provisions has resulted in cost escalation of building material, according to industry players here. Besides the hike in wages of daily-rated labourers, there has been 15 to 25 per cent increase in the costs of bricks, sand, stone and cement. ""Before the shutdown in Kashmir began on August 5, I purchased bricks for Rs 18,000 per truck. However, the same truckload of bricks is now costing me Rs 22,500,"" Manzoor Ahmad, a private work contractor, told PTI. He said the price escalation has happened due to shortage of brick kiln workers, who fled the Valley in view of the advisory issued by the government ahead of the decision to revoke special status to Jammu and Kashmir and split the state into two union territories. Aijaz Ahmad Dar, who is constructing a house in Hyderpora area of the city, said costs of all building material, except iron, has gone up in the past three months. ""A truckload of sand was sold at Rs 6,500 prior to shutdown but it now costs Rs 8,000. Same is the case with stones used in making foundation of the house. Against Rs 3,200 in June-July period, a truck of stones now costs Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000,"" he said. With local cement factories not operating due to the prevailing situation, only cement imported from outside the Valley is currently available in the market. ""For the first few weeks of the shutdown, the rates of cement remained stable as there were stocks of local cement available in the market. However, later on, the rates of imported cement went up by Rs 100 per bag of 50 kilograms,"" Dar said. Ghulam Mohammad Wani, a mason, said he is finding it hard to fulfil his contractual obligations due to the rise in wages of local labourers after August 5. ""I used to pay Rs 500 per day to each labourer, irrespective of him being a local or migrant worker. Since the exodus of the non-locals, the local labourers are demanding Rs 600 per day, which has disturbed my calculations as I had given rates for contracts to my clients according to earlier rates,"" Wani said. While private construction work is going on in full swing, the government construction work has been badly affected as the local contractors say they will be making losses if they carry on the work at present rates. ""We work on small profit margins in government contracts. The price escalation is in the range of around 25 to 30 per cent, which makes undertaking these works at this juncture unviable,"" Ishfaq Ahmad, a government contractor, said. He said the tenders for new work will have to figure in the price escalation as and when construction work can be resumed. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Most of the top level and second rung separatist politicians of Jammu and Kashmir have been taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders, including two former chief ministers — Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti — have been either detained or placed under house arrest in view of the Centre's decision to revoke special status to Jammu and Kashmir and splitting the state into two Union Territories. ""We continue to press for the release of detainees for the full restoration of everyday services, but most importantly, for roadmap to the restoration of political and economic normalcy,"" said acting assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia Alice G Wells. The US remains ""deeply concerned"" about the situation in the Valley where daily life of nearly eight million residents has been severely impacted since the decision to revoke Jammu and Kashmir's special status and to ""detain without charge"" political leaders and restrict communications, Wells said in an interaction with reporters at Foggy Bottom headquarters of the State Department. ""We've seen progress for example four million postpaid mobile phone users have had service restored, but SMS and internet is restricted,"" she said. Internet services across all platforms continued to be snapped in the Valley since the night of August 4, hours before the Centre announced its decision to abrogate Article 370 provisions that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir and split the state into two UTs, officials in Srinagar said. The internet services were snapped along with mobile and landline telephone services. While the landline telephone services were restored gradually first, the postpaid mobile services were restored only last week. The prepaid services continued to remain barred. Noting that journalists have extensively covered developments in Kashmir, Wells said the role of some of the international reporters have been particularly important, but journalists continue to face challenges in access while reporting due to the security restrictions. Wells said terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen ""obviously are the problem"". ""In this vein, we welcome (Pakistan) Prime Minister (Imran) Khan's unambiguous statement in September that anyone who crosses from Pakistan to carry out violence in Kashmir are enemies of both Pakistan and the Kashmiri people,"" she said. ""The constructive dialogue that we'd like to see between India and Pakistan must be based on Pakistan taking sustained and irreversible steps against militants and terrorists in its territory,"" Wells said. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have met and spoken with their Indian and Pakistani counterparts multiple times and all sides have the responsibility to create the conditions in Kashmir for dialogue including avoiding heated and unhelpful rhetoric, she said.

"No Article 370 was our promise, abrogation had strong effect on bypoll results: UP BJP chief | Lucknow News - Times of India","UP BJP chief and former transport minister Swatantra Dev Singh, under whose leadership the party saw first major byelections in the state, has said that abrogation of Article 370 in J&K was part of BJP’s poll manifesto in 2014 and follow-up action earlier this year helped the outfit shape crucial win on eight out of 11 Vidhan Sabha seats where bypolls were held on October 21 along with Maharashtra and Haryana. He spoke to Rohan Dua. Excerpts: In the first bypolls after BSP and SP split since 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP along with its ally Apna Dal has won eight out of 11 seats. Are you satisfied?There is a difference in being happy and satisfied. Satisfaction would have been if we won all 11 seats. But I am happy that people have again put their trust in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Results have not been that great in neighbouring Haryana for BJP, but anti-incumbency did not impact it in any of UP seats.We won even Hamirpur bypoll. The reason anti-incumbency did not affect here was we empowered common party worker with a ticket unlike BSP or SP or Congress. I can’t comment what went wrong in Haryana, but we will be on track soon. So overall, do you think your party’s flagship schemes like Ujjwala, Ayshman Bharat, Ujala and Jan Dhan Yojana worked again like in 2017 and 2019 polls in UP?These schemes have been well accepted and successful. But it’s the recent big step of annulment of Article 370 and 35A in J&K that assured people that we fulfilled our promise of manifesto... that we unified and fortified India. Congress has accused BJP of manipulating results in Gangoh assembly seat where its candidate Nooman Masood was ahead of BJP till 15 rounds.Out of 11 seats, Congress is second only in two and is behind either SP or BSP. They can’t even compete against any regional party. Our party workers are honest and neither get involved in bureaucracy nor government functioning or election management. First Congress would blame EVM and now manipulations. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has announced that his party will go solo even in 2022 UP assembly polls.SP has realised how untrustworthy the Bahujan Samaj Party and its president Mayawati are. You had said that you wear nationalism and not your OBC status on your sleeve. Will BJP be able to draw benefit out of caste split between BSP and SP in 2022 now or nationalism.The Dalits, who formed their core vote bank, have realised that BSP is unfaithful. The Yadavs have realised the same about Akhilesh Yadav. They put their trust in BJP because of our non-caste Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas brand of politics. Can incidents like killing of Hindu Samaj Party founder Kamlesh Tiwari affect poll results in UP?Our police swung into action without any consideration of merit or demerit. We are proud of the fact that our police have always maintained law and order situation and not allowed communal riots to take place ever unlike during SP and BSP rule for two decades.

 Selja-Hooda rivalry turns into election jugalbandi | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Given the reins of Haryana Congress barely weeks before the elections, Kumari Selja redirected the party ship that was adrift for months. Where the former Union minister got it right was in ensuring a working relationship with campaign committee chairman Bhupinder Singh Hooda despite past acrimony between them. The stability at the top projected Congress as a credible party, which was not affected by the spectacle that the midway defection of sacked party chief Ashok Tanwar triggered. The Dalit leader worked under the radar as Hooda hogged the limelight to woo voters. The Dalit-Jat combination paid off for Congress. It did exceptionally well in Jat areas as also in SC-reserved constituencies while consolidating votes in general constituencies. Many averred that a timely change of guard in the Congress unit could have taken the party over the line. Considering the performance, if Selja’s aspiration to head Congress in Haryana turned out to be baptism by fire, she can claim vindication. Heartened by the outcome though disappointed that the party fell just short, Selja told TOI, “The change of leadership in the state could have happened earlier. Still, we were able to consolidate our position. It is because of Congress’ strong challenge that BJP fell well short of majority when just months ago in the Lok Sabha elections it won in 79 of the 90 assembly segments.” Selja said BJP was high on propaganda but low on work, and it showed in people’s aggressive voting against the government. “The Prime Minister was in Haryana every second day. Why? His campaign about Article 370 did not resonate with people because after five years, BJP had nothing to show in terms of their work. It was a diversionary campaign,” she argued. The senior leader said that if BJP forms the government in Haryana, Congress will continue to consolidate itself while fighting for people. “It is an ideological battle and we will fight BJP every step of the way,” she said. Drawing a national message from the results, Selja warned BJP, “In a democracy, you cannot write off people’s will. In its arrogance, BJP forgot that people have a mind of their own and their government would have to deliver. Just events and self-promotion do not work. The economic slowdown is hurting the society. We will take up people’s issues nationally.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Two states, many lessons: What the verdict means | India News - Times of India","This was not supposed to be a competitive round. After the big BJP wins in Maharashtra and Haryana in the Lok Sabha elections only 5 months ago and the widely perceived support for decisions on J&K, the party’s win was a given. However, voters sprang a surprise by denying BJP a majority in Haryana and restricting its mandate in Maharashtra. The outcome will disappoint BJP and could trigger introspection about the adequacy of its “nationalist” plank in local leagues, especially amid an economic slowdown. It does not undercut its political pre-eminence but sharply underscores the challenges to its bid for countrywide dominance that Congress once enjoyed. The less-than-impressive saffron show just when it had seemed “unreachable” by a big distance is a tribute to the tenacity of the “local” — short-hand for personalities and factors that influence choices at the grassroots. They may be pushed to the background in an LS poll, yielding an overarching theme or a popular national leader like Narendra Modi, but return with vengeance in state elections. Results of by-elections and, in many cases, success of rebels are also a testimony to the resilience of the rooted. The Indian experience provides validation for former US Speaker Tip O’ Neill, who famously said all politics is local. Economic slowdown: A slowing economy, unemployment and rural distress were issues and the jury is out on whether and to what degree they hurt BJP. Opposition parties predictably brought them up and pointed to a sullen mood. But to what ‘extent’ remains unresolved, considering that BJP picked up over 300 seats in the LS election against what some considered a very adverse setting. Also, BJP faced incumbency in both Haryana and Maharashtra and couldn’t have returned the numbers they did if they had faced large-scale resentment. Possibly, the discontent over kitchen table themes kept BJP from fully leveraging its assets CASTE MATTERS: Caste solidarity which yielded to Modi’s personal popularity and the strength of his plank, proved its salience yet again. The dominant castes of Marathas and Jats, who were feeling downsized, demonstrated their relevance. The performance of Pawar and Hooda owe a lot to caste support which also boosted new regional satrap Dushyant Chautala. The staunch support from their kin allowed their leaders to forge formidable social constituencies at the local level Article 370:Difficult to say to what extent the seemingly popular move to do away with the special status for J&K helped or hindered BJP. For, finding a reliable answer would require complete clarity on how the party would have performed if the ‘nationalist’ issue had not been in play. Also, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda broke ranks with Rahul Gandhi to back the decision, while NCP’s Sharad Pawar and JJP’s Dushyant Chautala refrained from opposing it. But the slim win in Maharashtra and failure to score an outright win in Haryana will reinforce the view that local can trump national in regional arenas. Opposition parties may feel encouraged to resist BJP’s aggressive posture on the matter Regional players: From Arvind Kejriwal to Mamata Banerjee, regional satraps must be relieved.For, an emphatic performance by BJP would have left it thirsting for similar feats on their turfs. It could also have lent impetus to JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar’s scarcely concealed plan to keep BJP as his junior partner in Bihar for the coming state elections had he not fared so poorly in the by-polls GRAFT CASES: Whether allegations of corruption influence polls has been debated endlessly with people voting out the allegedly corrupt only to bring them back the next time. This time too, graft charges failed to dent Pawar or Hooda. Pawar, in fact, shrewdly turned a courtdirected ED inquiry to fend off BJP’s aggressive designs Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Any attempt to disrupt peace and interference in India's internal will not be tolerated: Venkaiah Naidu | India News - Times of India,"BAKU (AZERBAIJAN): India wants to maintain cordial relations with all countries, including all its immediate neighbours, but any attempt to disrupt peace and interference in its internal matters will not be tolerated, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu said on Thursday. ""Peace is a pre-requisite for progress and we cannot allow anyone to derail the journey towards peace and prosperity,"" Naidu said, in an apparent reference to Pakistan, which is accused by its neighbours of providing safe havens to terrorists who carry out cross-border attacks. Underscoring India's broad liberal vision of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the whole world is one family), he said that India wants to maintain cordial relations with all countries, including all its immediate neighbours. ""However, any attempt to disrupt peace and interference with our country's internal matters will not be tolerated,"" said Naidu, who is here to attend the 19th Non Aligned Movement (NAM) summit. Addressing the Indian diaspora here, he apprised them about the recent developments in Jammu and Kashmir and said the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution was a ""step to extend to the people of the state all the benefits being enjoyed by the other Indian citizens."" Naidu said the Indian 'Diaspora' formed the 4th 'D' in the quartet of 'D's that was propelling India forward, the first three being Democracy, Demand and Demographic Dividend. He called for further deepening of ties between India and Azerbaijan. ""I can see many opportunities for Indian companies to engage with their counterparts in field such as Information and Communications Technology, pharmaceuticals, renewable energy, agriculture and food processing to name a few,"" the Vice-President said. He thanked Azerbaijan for releasing a postal stamp to celebrate the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi on the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary.

 Assembly poll results: Victory for BJP with reduced margins | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The BJP's underwhelming show in the two state assembly elections, especially in Haryana, has left the party with issues to ponder on even though it looked set to form governments there as well as in Maharashtra. A BJP leader said the poll outcome in Haryana showed that the ""micro issues"" played a role in the party's below-par performance in the state, where it built its campaign around ""macro issues"" like abrogation of Article 370. Local factors also played a key role in Maharashtra, where the saffron party did not get an overwhelming mandate as it was hoping for. It was also felt that the wide margin between the party's vote share in the recent Lok Sabha polls and these assembly elections show that voters are driven by different factors in different elections, and the BJP's effort to frame every contest around issues like nationalism to subsume local bread and butter issues may not hit the bull's-eye every time. Another party leader, who did not wish to be named, said agrarian issues and large scale defection of opposition leaders to the BJP may have worked adversely against the party's interest in Maharashtra. Asked if NCP veteran Sharad Pawar managed the issue of Enforcement Directorate registering a case against him during elections to his advantage by projecting himself as a victim of political vendetta, he said it was certainly ""bad optics"" for the BJP. In Haryana, he said a consolidation of votes of Jats, the largest community in the state, against the BJP was crucial in harming the party's prospects. The Congress, which failed to bag even one seat in the Lok Sabha polls in Haryana, won or was ahead in 31 of the 90 seats at stake compared to its previous tally of 15. The BJP, which had 47 seats in the outgoing 90-member house, won or was ahead in 40 seats. The half-way mark is 46. From the 58 per cent vote share the BJP had in the Lok Sabha polls, it fell to 36.5 per cent in the assembly polls. As per the results and trends available in Maharashtra, the BJP's tally in the 288-member Assembly was 103 while it was 57 for the Sena. In the 2014 polls, the BJP and the Sena won 122 and 63 seats respectively. They had then contested separately. The saffron alliance vote share stood at 42 per cent against 51 per cent in the parliamentary polls. Though in both states the BJP and its allies are much ahead of their rivals but a creditable performance by the Congress in Haryana when the opposition was considered out of reckoning by most pollsters highlighted the gap between the issues on the ground and the popular narrative, a saffron ally said. Allies of the BJP may feel boosted by the results as it will now have to depend more on a party like Shiv Sena, which was feeling increasing marginalised since 2014 as the BJP replaced it as the senior partner.

 Sharad Pawar: Consummate politician who piloted NCP back into reckoning | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: His party battered by multiple desertions just ahead of the Maharashtra polls, NCP chief Sharad Pawar is the consummate politician who may be down but has just told the political world that he refuses to be out In an election expected to be a one-sided affair with a BJP-Shiv Sena sweep, the Nationalist Congress Party on Thursday was poised to win 53 seats, just four behind the Shiv Sena. Upping its 2014 tally of 41, the Pawar-led NCP also overturned the power equation with ""big brother"" Congress, which was ahead in 46 seats. The icing on the cake was the NCP's win in the Satara Lok Sabha bypoll, with the party's candidate Shriniwas Patil defeating the BJP's Udayanraje Bhosale, who had left the NCP to join the saffron party. The credit for pulling out the party from the depths of an existential crisis goes to the doughty 79-year-old, who has five decades in politics behind him and has proved once again that he is made of sterner political mettle than his detractors would give him credit for, insiders said. With several NCP leaders jumping the ship ahead of the Assembly polls, the never-say-die NCP patriarch went about reviving its prospects by going on a whirlwind tour of the constituencies it contested. Frail in health, he took on the BJP's leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, on key issues like the agrarian crisis and Article 370. Thursday's results are an indication that Pawar's charisma is intact, said NCP spokesperson Sanjay Tatkare. ""The NCP gaining 54 seats and the Congress nearly retaining its 2014 tally after the BJP and Shiv Sena predicted 220 seats for themselves, talks about his charisma. This election will be remembered for the fight put up by Pawar Saheb,"" Tatkare said. Pawar has been a defence minister, opposition leader in the Lok Sabha and three-time Maharashtra chief minister in a career spanning 52 years. He was a member of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and the Lok Sabha for seven times each. Pawar, a former Congress leader, shot to fame in 1978 when he dislodged the then Vasant Patil dispensation in the state to form a government with the Janata Party. He was only 38 at the time and is Maharashtra's youngest chief minister till date. He went on to become chief minister of the state two more times between June 1988 and June 1991 and from March 1993 and March 1995. Pawar served as defence minister from June 1991 to March 1993. The veteran leader parted ways with the Congress in 1999 over party president Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin issue and formed the NCP in the same year. The Congress and NCP came together following the 1999 Assembly election in Maharashtra to form government in the state. Pawar became Agriculture minister in the Manmohan Singh government 2004 and served over the next 10 years. Often accused by his rivals of encouraging dynastic politics, Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule is a three-time MP from Baramati, the NCP's stronghold. His nephew Ajit, former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, will be representing the Baramati Assembly segment for sixth time in a row. Pawar's grand nephew Rohit too will enter the lower House for the first time with the latter's victory over BJP contender Ram Shinde from Karjat-Jamkhed seat. Apart from politics, Pawar has been associated with cricket bodies including the International Cricket Council and Maharashtra State Wrestling Association.

" India lashes out at Pak at UN, says linchpins of terror networks enjoy safe havens in this country | India News - Times of India","UNITED NATIONS: In a veiled attack on Pakistan, India has said that nothing damages the credibility of the cause of human rights more severely than its misuse as a ""decoy"" by a country which provides patronage and safe havens to the ""linchpins of terror networks"". Pakistan this week raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir at the UN, referring to the communications lockdown in the state following the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution. The Pakistani representative noted that the Kashmiri people were being denied their basic rights. Responding to this, First Secretary in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Paulomi Tripathi said, ""Nothing damages the credibility of the cause of human rights more severely, than its misuse as a decoy, to divert attention from the real issues."" ""Unfortunately, one delegation, in yet another such attempt, has referred to an internal matter of my country,"" Tripathi said on Monday in the General Assembly's Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural), making a veiled reference to Pakistan. ""The truth is - as far too many victims of terrorism all over the world languish in trauma, the linchpins of terror networks enjoy patronage and safe havens in this country,” she said. Tripathi asserted that the international community is too familiar with ""this deceitful tactic"" and has ""rejected"" these attempts for what these are - ""desperate attempts to mask territorial ambition."" She said that India does not wish to dwell upon the issue any further. Speaking at the Third Committee debate on ‘Promotion and protection of human rights', Tripathi said a state's human rights obligations extend to all branches and nations need to build the capacity of multiple actors and enable coordination among them. ""Capacity building and technical cooperation, therefore, have crucial role in this matrix,"" she said. Further, the right to development remains important and its operationalisation needs to be prioritised. She also noted that the Universal Periodic Review is a platform for dialogue and cooperation on human rights situations in all countries and nations must avoid turning the review ""into a platform for pushing selective human rights issues."" Tripathi also stressed the need to envision human rights protection measures for the digital age, keeping in view emerging issues such as right to non-discrimination in the age of algorithm; freedom of expression online controlled by private platforms; right to privacy in the era of data collection and how to counter misuse of these technologies that lead to human rights abuses.

" BJP, Shiv Sena continue to surge in Maharashtra | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The BJP and its ally Shiv Sena are continuing to surge in Maharashtra with leads on 99 and 60 assembly constituencies, respectively, as counting of votes is underway, according to official trends of the Election Commission (EC). The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) was ahead in 48 seats and its ally Congress on 40, at the time of filing this report. There are 288 seats in the Maharashtra assembly. Counting of votes began at 8 am today. The state went to polls in a single phase on October 21. The BJP had contested on 150 seats while Shiv Sena had fielded its candidates in 124 constituencies in the state. The remaining seats were left for smaller allies. On the other hand, Congress contested the polls in alliance with the NCP. Most exit polls have predicted the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena alliance getting elected in Maharashtra but have differed in their projection of the number of seats. The assembly elections are the first after the BJP-led government's decision to revoke Article 370. A verdict in its favour will give a boost to the party ahead of the winter session of Parliament next month. A victory will also keep the political momentum with the BJP after its emphatic victory in the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The polls are equally as crucial for the Congress which has faced desertions after its second successive debacle in the Lok Sabha polls. A strong performance will help the party in its process of electoral revival. The BJP has already declared that incumbent Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will continue to lead the state government if the party is voted to power.

 Zakir Musa’s successor killed in encounter : Jammu and Kashmir DGP | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir director general of police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh on Wednesday claimed that al-Qaida-affiliated Ansar Gazwat-ul-Hind (AGH) has been wiped out from Kashmir with the killing of three of its remaining local terrorists. “The three terrorists — identified as Hamid Lelhari, Naveed and Junaid of AGH — were killed during an encounter with security forces at Awantipora in Pulwama district of south Kashmir on Tuesday evening,’’ the DGP said at a press conference here. Singh said Lelhari, Naveed and Junaid were killed as part of the intensified anti-terror operation in Kashmir following the defanging of Article 370 on August 5. He admitted that initially there was some confusion about the identities of the slain terrorists, but later it was found that all three were locals and belonged to AGH. The DGP said after the killing of AGH chief Zakir Musa earlier this year, the command of the outfit was given to Lelhari, who motivated Naveed and Junaid of Pulwama to join his organisation. AGH was working in close coordination with Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) and Hizul Mujahideen. “Lelhari was active since 2016. He was involved in Kakpora attack as well as killing of policeman Fayaz Ahmed and some civilians,” the DGP said, adding, “He had also been harassing people in Awantipora.” The police chief said Lelhari, Naveed and Junaid were involved in the killing of truck driver Sharif Khan, a native of Rajasthan, in south Kashmir on October 17. A day later, the trio killed brick-kiln worker S S Sagar from Chhattisgarh and apple trader Charanjit Singh from Punjab in the same area. Singh said Junaid’s brother Yasir was also a terrorist belonging to another outfit. “We feel sorry that two of them belonged to the same family and went on a wrong path,’’ the DGP said, adding that the two brothers were involved in the killing of two nomads in Tral earlier this month. About the present situation, Singh said, “Terrorists are interfering in people’s lives and they are not desisting from killing citizens to stop them from doing their routine work.” Claiming that since August 5 lesser number of boys have joined militancy compared to the same timeframe in the previous year, Singh urged youths treading the wrong path to shun violence and return to normal life. The DGP said the situation in Kupwara and Baramulla was normal and it was really difficult to move on the roads there due to traffic. Same was the scene in Bandipora. “We hope that the winds of normalcy blowing from north reach south Kashmir too,’’ he said. The police chief rejected speculations that cellphones would be blocked again in Kashmir. “There are no such plans. When the situation demanded, cells phones were shut. But after the situation improved, the services were restored.” About infiltration, Singh said a sizable number of terrorists had infiltrated into Kashmir after August 5 and many infiltration attempts were foiled at Keeran, Karana, Machil and Uri among other places. About the arrests of minors, the DGP said cases of juveniles had been referred to the Juvenile Justice Board. Asked about the FIR against the SIT members for allegedly torturing one of the Kathua rape-and-murder accused, who was later acquitted by the court, Singh said, “The FIR has been filed on the directions of the court. There is nothing to worry.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Violence and intimidation is wholly unacceptable: Boris Johnson on Kashmir protests on Diwali | India News - Times of India,"LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday said ""violence and intimidation anywhere is wholly unacceptable"", as pro-Pakistani demonstrators plan to stage Kashmir protests outside the Indian High Commission here on Diwali day. During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session in Parliament, Conservative Party MP Bob Blackman spoke of the violent protests by similar ""pro-Pakistani"" groups at the London mission during Independence Day celebrations on August 15 and sought action to prevent a repeat of the violence. ""This is a police operational matter and the home secretary [Priti Patel] will be raising it with the police,"" Johnson responded. ""We must all be clear in this House that violence and intimidation anywhere is wholly unacceptable in this country,"" he said. Blackman has been speaking out in favour of India since the decision to revoke Article 370 and withdrawing the special status of Jammu and Kashmir found echoes among Britain's MPs. The north London MP, who is also chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Hindus, has accused the Opposition Labour party of interfering in an internal matter of India. On Wednesday in Parliament, he said: ""In this House, we defence forever the right of peaceful protest. Yet on 15 August, pro-Pakistani organisations held violent protests outside the Indian High Commission. ""This Sunday, there is the threat of 10,000 people being brought to demonstrate outside the Indian High Commission on Diwali, the most holy day for Hindus, Sikhs and Jains. What action is the government going to take to prevent violent protests this Sunday?"" Blackman has also written to London Mayor Sadiq Khan urging him to take steps to ensure the so-called ""Free Kashmir"" march on Sunday does not proceed. ""I am receiving vast amounts of correspondence from multiple diasporas highlighting concerns which stem from community safety perspectives plus the obviously confrontational date selected: the holy festival of Diwali,"" he notes in his letter. Last week, the London Mayor had issued a statement condemning the march and called on the groups to reconsider, while highlighting that the power to ban marches of this nature lies solely with the UK home secretary and not with the mayoral office. ""This march will only deepen divisions at a time when Londoners need to come together. That is why I am calling on those organising the march and all those considering taking part in it to think again and cancel their plans,"" he said, stressing that his City Hall office would be working with Scotland Yard to ensure a ""robust"" policing plan was in place for such a march. According to Metropolitan Police details on the permissions sought for the proposed march, an estimated 5,000-10,000 protesters plan to commence their march from Richmond Terrace near Downing Street and converge outside the Indian High Commission in London. ""This march finishes at the diplomatic mission – the very building which saw prolonged bouts of violence and thuggery in the summer and sadly the building remains scarred from when windows were smashed, objects repeatedly thrown and other ugly scenes,"" notes Blackman in his letter to Khan, in reference to the violent clashes on August 15. ""After the horrific scenes in August the Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist diasporas are worried that authorities in the United Kingdom are not doing enough to protect them,"" he adds. The so-called ""Free Kashmir"" rally is being promoted across social media channels as an annual ""Black Day"" event to mark October 27, 1947, as the day when Indian troops allegedly entered the then princely kingdom of Kashmir. The ""President"" of Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, Sardar Masood Khan, and PoK ""Prime Minister"" Raja Muhammad Farooq Haider Khan are expected to participate in the march on Sunday.

Kashmiris across the board seek healing from a corrupt, oppressive, social and political culture that has emerged in Kashmir for the past 70 years and more intensely in the last 30 years,"" said the report submitted by the group to Union minister Jitendra Singh.

For these sections of the society, independence was achieved on 5th August 2019,"" the report said. However, it would be the responsibility of the state and the Centre to provide a healing touch to the already wronged sections of society, it said. ""With the one nation, one Constitution a reality, it is hoped that the dominance of Kashmir hegemony in J&K discourse will end and Jammu too will get its due share,"" said the report. It said people in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh want the government of India to make the union territories model work in Kashmir. ""They look towards the Centre to reach out to them with real changes. We recommend that the process of healing between the government of India and the Kashmiris be facilitated. Any group or set of persons nationally or internationally trying to derail this process should not be allowed to betray the Kashmiris,"" said the ""Report from Ground Zero: Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh after setting aside Articles 370 and 35A"". Singh, minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office, after meeting with the group said the decision to remove Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution from Jammu and Kashmir in August this year was a historic decision. He said that opposite to the common perception, the state was most exploited under the pretext of Article 370. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has been split into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. These Union territories will come into effect from October 31. ""The changes which are going to come after October 31, would be revolutionary. It cannot be imagined now. People in the state have lived in deprivation. They even don't know what all they have missed or been deprived of. They will feel what all they have been deprived of when they start getting all facilities and benefits of central government-run welfare schemes,"" said Singh, who is also Lok Sabha member from Udhampur constituency near Jammu. He said that contrary to the misinformation being spread by certain sections about the clampdown situation in J&K, this year has been the most peaceful in the last 20-25 years. Singh said that important festivals like Eid and Independence Day have been celebrated in a peaceful manner without any instance of violence after many years. On the militancy issue, the minister said that terrorism and militancy are in the last phase in Jammu and Kashmir. He said that vested interests of some people have led to these misleading perceptions about the threat to identity of people from Jammu & Kashmir. Singh questioned as to whether Article 370 is required to save the identity of people in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and West Bengal? He said that after October 31, many women-welfare related provisions will also be implemented. Singh said central laws including those to check dowry and child marriages were not implemented in Jammu and Kashmir due to Article 370 by previous governments. ""These laws will now be implemented in the state,"" the minister said. Singh said that there are now no barriers in the industrial development of J&K. He said that development in J&K will also curb the ""youth exodus"" from the state as there will be ample opportunities available to them, from which they were deprived earlier. The minister said that the development model of the Northeast can be replicated in J&K. He said that food processing parks can be opened for apples, strawberry and other fruits on the lines of citrus fruit park in the Northeast. The minister said that other products of J&K such as Pashmina also have huge commercial potential which needs to be tapped for the economic well being of people. Founded in 2015, the Group of Intellectuals and Academicians (GIA) is a group of professional women and entrepreneurs, mediapersons and academicians committed to social justice and nation-building.

"Terror needs to be eradicated for people to enjoy rights, Indian-American attorney tells US Congress - Times of India","WASHINGTON: Terror needs to be eradicated, so rights and freedoms mean something, a top Indian-American attorney has said as several US lawmakers underscored the importance of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir after the revocation of its special status. Ravi Batra's remarks came while responding to a Congressional subcommittee on human rights in South Asia. ""When you have people afraid to come out of their house because they don't want to be blown up because cross border terrorism exists as a daily event and homegrown terrorist being nurtured. The first thing somebody wants before they want human rights, they want to live,"" the attorney from New York told the subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I owe India an apology, as when she suffered the Mumbai terror attack on November 26, 2008, when Jews and Americans were singled out for death by Pakistan-based-terrorists, I joined in arguing for 'restraint'. I was wrong. Terror needs to be eradicated, so our rights and freedoms mean something,"" Batra said. Batra said like former US President Abraham Lincoln, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also took extraordinary steps like legal amendments to have legal authority and then installing a massive force to prevent fatalities in Kashmir from motivated fire-fights by cross-border or home-grown terrorists. Batra, who was personally invited by Congressman Eliot Engel, Chairman of the house foreign affairs committee to testify on this important issue, referred to Modi's argument in abrogating Article 370 of the Constitution that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. ""He (Modi) said he did this to bring the promise of equal rights and freedoms to all Indians. His actions on August 5, 2019 were judicious, as they were careful. No war broke out. Terrorists were immobilized, as communications and internet were cut off,” Batra said. ""India, it seems, learned from her Mumbai terror attack. Indeed, landing at JFK airport, when standing in line for immigration inspection, there is no phone service or internet connection. Safety matters,"" he said. Batra also drew a parallel between Jammu and Kashmir and the US states of Louisiana and Alaska. ""A simple point worth making: Kashmir was attached to India by a legal decree duly signed by its then-Hindu ruler Maharaja Hari Singh, several months after the needlessly bloody Partition when tens of millions were killed,"" he said.

India also expressed deep concerns about the unilateral military offensive by Turkey in northeast Syria, saying that Ankara's actions can undermine stability in the region and has the potential for causing humanitarian and civilian distress. On the other hand, Turkey also supported Pakistan during the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) plenary meeting in Paris earlier this month, a stance which did not go down well with India.

The BDC polls are slated to be held on Thursday when over 3,300 sarpanchs and panchs will cast their votes to elect 310 out of a total 520 candidates in fray. The election results will be declared the same day. Out of the 3,300 sarpanchs and panchs, who will exercise their franchise, BJP claims the support of 1,500. Official sources said that 27 candidates, 22 of whom are affiliated to BJP, would be elected unopposed. Many political parties — including Congress, National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Peoples Conference (PC) — have boycotted BDC polls, citing continuous detention of their respective party leadership following defanging of Article 370 on August 5. Both NC and PDP had also stayed away from panchayat as well as municipal polls last year. These parties have been alleging that BDC polls are being conducted to ensure the victory of BJP. Election officials said adequate security arrangements have been put in place. “We have made tight security arrangements to ensure smooth conduct of BDC polls,” an official said. These elections are being conducted just seven days before the state is set to be bifurcated into two Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh. The decision to reorganise J&K was taken by Parliament on August 5 when it turned Article 370, which granted special status to the state, into a dead letter. Earlier, the government had stated that panchayat raj system would be strengthened in J&K to ensure development at the grass-roots level. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

If detaining 200-300 people helps maintain peace, then let them stay there for a little longer. Anyone harming peace process in J&K will be jailed. We can detain 300-400 more people for the new system and there are many jails for such people in India,” Madhav said. Talking about employment in J&K, Madhav rubbished speculations that the dilution of Article 370 would lead to loss of jobs for local youth. “Some people are talking nonsense about job losses and losing land with the repeal of Article 370. No step will be taken against your interests. Each job in the state will be provided to the youth of the state.

 Campus buzz is back at NIT Srinagar on first day for new batch | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Desolate for almost three months, the sprawling Hazratbal campus of NIT Srinagar came alive on Monday with more than half the new batch of students showing up for the start of their new semester, which also marked the resumption of classes across departments after a long period of uncertainty. A fresher from Andhra Pradesh waiting for his turn to complete the first-day formalities admitted to being a tad nervous when he came in, but said he felt relaxed when he saw students milling on the campus. “Everything looks fine now. I am not harbouring any fear,"" he said. A first-year student who arrived in Srinagar from her hometown in Rajasthan a couple of days ago said she was ""relieved"" to find the campus ""as normal as it should be"" and her classmates from Kashmir friendly and helpful. ""Those of us from outside J&K have been receiving invitations from our classmates here to stay in their homes. It's been quite a revelation, really."" Although NIT Srinagar formally reopened on October 15, it was only on Monday that the first classes were held since the August 5 lockdown. “Of the 778 students in the new batch, 494 attended classes on the first day,"" Rakesh Sehgal, the institute's director, told TOI. ""Students in their seventh semester also resumed classes. We are functioning normally."" The new batch has a 50:50 ratio of students from J&K and elsewhere in the country. A third-semester student from Samba in Jammu said the NIT campus was mature enough not to encourage any us-and-them debate. “In the hostel. We don't discuss anything that has the potential to vitiate the atmosphere,"" he said. As TOI went around the sprawling campus, it was hard not to notice the absence of police or paramilitary personnel. NIT Srinagar makes do with its own private security comprising personnel clad in blue uniform, which the institute's director said was a conscious attempt to erase the image of police's omnipresence in J&K. “We don’t need police or paramilitary personnel here. Everything is normal on the campus. The new students are enjoying attending classes in this relaxed atmosphere,” Sehgal said. With the first-day jitters out of the way, the NIT administration has put placements for the outgoing batch on its priority list. Around 550 students received job offers from multinational companies in June, but the rest are still waiting to hear from prospective employers. Director Sehgal said several companies had committed themselves to resuming the placement process. “Nearly 54 students have been offered a starting package of more than Rs 10 lakh,” a teacher said.

" US says support India's objectives on repealing Article 370, but concerned over situation in Kashmir | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Tuesday said while it supports India's development agenda behind the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370, it was concerned over the current situation in the Valley. It said it was closely monitoring the situation in the state following India's August 5 decision. The Indian government has argued that its decision on Article 370 was driven by a desire to increase economic development, reduce corruption and uniformly apply all national laws in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in regard to women and minorities, acting assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia Alice G Wells told subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and nonproliferation of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""While we support these objectives, the US state department remains concerned about the situation in the Kashmir Valley, where daily life for the nearly eight million residents has been severely impacted since August 5,"" Wells said in a prepared statement submitted to the congressional subcommittee on the eve of the hearing ""Human Rights in South Asia: Views from the State Department and the Region"". The US state department, she said, has closely monitored the situation in Jammu and Kashmir following India's August 5 decision to abrogate Article 370 provisions of the Constitution and bifurcate the state into two Union Territories. ""While conditions in Jammu and Ladakh have improved, the Valley has not returned to normal,"" Wells said, adding the State Department has raised concerns with the Indian government regarding the detentions of local residents and political leaders, including three former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir. ""We have urged Indian authorities to respect human rights and restore full access to services, including internet and mobile networks,"" she said. Postpaid mobile service has been restored in the valley, but internet access remains intermittent, Wells said. She said both foreign and local journalists have extensively covered developments in Kashmir, but many have faced challenges in access and reporting due to security restrictions. ""While exact figures are difficult to ascertain, we understand several thousand people have been detained over the past two months, although many have subsequently been released,"" the top US diplomat said. According to government sources, hundreds remain in detention – many without charges – under the Public Safety Act, which allows for administrative detention of up to two years, Wells said. Welcoming actions by the Indian government to improve the situation and address local grievances, she said the Indian home ministry recently said the statehood will be restored to Jammu and Kashmir following a period as a Union Territory, reaffirming what Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in his August 15 Independence Day speech. The US, she said, also encourages the Indian government to follow through on its commitment to hold assembly elections in the state at the earliest opportunity. Some local political leaders were released earlier this month, a trend Wells said she hopes will continue. Government offices, primary schools, and colleges are open, although student attendance remains low, she said. The Indian Supreme Court, Wells said, is planning to hear petitions related to Kashmir on November 14 and the Jammu and Kashmir High Court is reviewing habeas corpus cases. ""While these steps are positive, they are incremental, and we continue to press India to restore everyday services, including SMS and internet communications, as swiftly as possible,"" she said.

Jaishankar, while speaking at the   US-India strategic partnership   forum here, asserted that the change in Article 370 of the Constitution was India's ""internal business"". ""This change is our internal business but obviously there was interest around the world because different people had views about it and our neighbours made a bit of a fuss about it,"" he said. The minister said that after the move to do away with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, India prioritised engaging with the governments of different countries to make them understand what the change was about. ""So, by the time I actually went to the US in September which was about six weeks after the event, we had made considerable progress. I think it was a much more difficult challenge with the media, especially the English-speaking liberal media because partly they were very ideological about it, they had strong preset views on this subject,"" he said. ""In my view...in many ways they did not present a fair picture. Maybe they did not absorb a fair picture either,"" the External Affairs Minister said. A lot of it was really about correcting cumulative impressions that one gets by being at the receiving end of the media coverage, Jaishankar said. ""I found a lot of people... were surprised at the information that the particular provision of the Constitution that was changed was a temporary provision because the media does not say that,"" he said. Article 370 narrowed the scope for business and raised the cost of business in Kashmir which meant that there was less development, Jaishankar said. ""A lot of these things, people were not reading in the press. A lot of them were hearing it for the first time...that was the sum total of my experience (in the US),"" he said.

When asked about the relationship between India and Pakistan and scope for dialogue between the two countries, Madhav said the relationship has had its own ups and downs in the last seven decades. India will certainly be happy to have friendly relations with Pakistan but first of all it has to address this major issue of cross-border terrorism. ""Today we are passing through a phase where Pakistan is not seen as a difficult relationship by India alone anymore...Many countries in the world see affairs in Pakistan as an issue to be concerned about especially talking about the terror infrastructure in Pakistan,"" he said while speaking at a conference organised by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum.  Madhav said there was time when countries used to advise India to have dialogue with Pakistan but today nobody is doing that, as Pakistan has become the epicentre of global terrorism. ""Pakistan is not only a problem of India anymore. Now it has become a global challenge. Terror infrastructure in Pakistan is epicentre of global terrorism. On certain issues like terrorism the entire democratic world has come together to pursue the Pakistan's leadership to act."". Madhav, who also looks after the party's affairs in Jammu and Kashmir, said the way Pakistan responded about Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370, today it ""stands isolated"" in front of the global community. ""But that also shows the real intention seems to be to somehow use the extraneous issues to manage the internal contradictions in the country. Pakistan government is not really serious about managing the internal affairs of the country which should be its foremost priority or obligation.

She said BJP did not raise a single issue related to governance or mention any of its achievement during the campaign. “People said first you should give your report and then ask for vote. They could not give a report and tried to divert attention continuously,” the former Union minister said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 J&amp;K chief secretary chairs high-level meet to review tourism promotional campaign | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir chief secretary B V R Subrahmanyam reviewed on Sunday promotional campaigns for wooing tourists, days after the state administration withdrew its August 2 security advisory for holiday-makers and Amarnath pilgrims. The advisory, asking tourists to leave the Valley immediately due to ""terror threat"", was issued days before the government abrogated the special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. The advisory led to exodus of tourists from Kashmir and had a huge impact on the sector. After the Centre scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5, the Valley was shut leading to losses to stakeholders during the peak tourist season. On October 7, Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik directed lifting the advisory with effect from October 10. Subrahmanyam on Sunday also reviewed the overall functioning of the tourism sector and stressed on outsourcing assets and exclusive marketing portals for houseboats and incentivising paying guest houses, an official spokesperson said. Principal Secretary, Tourism, Navin Choudhary; Director, Tourism Kashmir, Nisar Ahmad Wani; Managing Director, J&K Tourism Development Corporation, Asgar Hussain; Director, Industries and Commerce, Mahmood A Shah and other officers of the tourism department attended the meeting. The chief secretary stressed on promoting the tourism potential of the state at global level through an attractive marketing campaign and providing marketing platforms for the houseboats and paying guesthouses on dedicated web portals to attract niche clientele, the spokesperson said. He also directed the tourism department to launch an exclusive advertisement campaign for houseboats, which, he said, is the unique selling proposition (USP) of the Valley's tourism sector. ""Every region of the state has something unique to offer to every class of tourists and the same should be conveyed through these campaigns,"" he said. The chief secretary also stressed on outsourcing departmental assets to private firms for better operations and commercially viability. ""This will also improve service delivery and ensure better use of these assets,"" Subrahmanyam said. The principal secretary, tourism, informed the meeting that the department is participating in the roadshows both within and outside the country besides using outdoor media for massive promotional campaigns to attract more tourists to the state, the spokesperson said.

" Modi govt to give 'true' self-rule, autonomy to J&amp;K: Jitendra Singh | India News - Times of India","KATHUA (J&K): Union minister Jitendra Singh said on Sunday that Jammu and Kashmir would get ""true"" self-rule and autonomy under the Modi government, and it would be quite different to the ""frivolous slogans"" of such demands raised by Kashmir-centric political parties. Addressing a meeting of BJP candidates contesting the block development council (BDC) election, Singh said it is important for party workers to understand and also make others understand that this is for the first time after Independence the concept of three-tier grassroots democracy comprising panchayats, BDCs and district councils is being introduced in the state. ""Jammu and Kashmir will get true self rule and true autonomy under the Modi government, and that will be quite in contrast to the frivolous slogans of self-rule and autonomy raised by Kashmir-centric political parties, which have been befooling the people of the state for decades, only to perpetuate their dynasty rule generation after generation,"" the BJP leader said. Singh said the question to be asked to the ""champions of so-called autonomy"" is whether they have any moral authority to ""fool"" the people of Kashmir by making such demands after they boycotted the panchayat and BDC elections, which he said are meant to confer autonomy to the representatives elected at the village level. The ""champions"" of self-rule, he said, must reply which self-rule they are talking about when their own government ""resisted"" all efforts to hold panchayat elections and, when the election did happen during the governor's rule, they boycotted it. The minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said the response to both panchayat and BDC elections had been ""enthusiastic"" in Kashmir, adding that the highest number of candidates for the BDC election were not from any district in the Jammu region, but from Kupwara and Baramulla districts in the Valley. According to the minister, the central grant has started reaching directly to the local bodies for the first time, due to which many of the panchayats have already received Rs 20-30 lakh in the first phase itself, which is ""more than the total amount"" received by them in the last several decades. ""Will the Congress party answer why they were hesitant in introducing this provision in Jammu and Kashmir even though it was brought in by their own prime minister Rajiv Gandhi,"" Singh asked. ""And, whether by doing so, were they not hand in glove with the Kashmir-centric dynasties seeking to appease certain section of voters at the cost of the poor man living in rural areas?"" The BJP leader said now it is up to people to liberate their minds from Article 370, which gave special status to the state, because sometimes it still appears that ""we are not able to get over the subdued psyche to which we were subjected for years together"". ""A new era of equitable growth and self-confidence has begun and it is for us to prepare ourselves to avail the best of it,"" he said. Hitting out at the Congress, National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, which had ""predicted an earthquake"" if Article 370 was revoked, Singh claimed that they, too, have accepted that the people across the sections have welcomed this revocation and ""that is why now they do not have the courage to utter the word Article 370"".

‘Ahirwal ka apmaan’: Narendra Modi slams Congress on Article 370 | Gurgaon News - Times of India,"ELLENABAD/REWARI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrapped up his party’s campaign in Haryana, which will go to polls on October 21, with two rallies where his focus remained on Kashmir and the opening of the Kartarpur corridor. In south Haryana’s Rewari, where the rally wasn’t originally planned but chalked in after BJP felt it needed a lift, Modi urged the crowd to punish Congress by not voting for it since it questioned the move by his government to abrogate Article 370, which gave Kashmir special status. Terming the Congress stand ‘Ahirwal ka apmaan (an insult to Ahirwal/as the region is known)’, Modi said the best punishment would be to remove Congress from the political landscape itself. Recounting his visit to Rewari on September 15, 2013, just two days after BJP announced his name as its PM candidate, Modi repeatedly asked the crowd to remember what happened on August 5 this year (when the Centre announced its Kashmir decision). “In 1964, Congress gave a false assurance right in Parliament that Article 370 is temporary and will be repealed within a year. It failed to do that all these years, and now when we finally abrogated it, it (Congress) is seething. (It is) asking what Modi thinks of himself. And it has the audacity to come and seek your votes. This is an insult to Ahirwal,” Modi said. Saying that he could take a strong decision on Article 370 because people of Haryana had strengthened his hands in parliamentary polls, he sought the same support in the assembly polls. At his other rally at Malekan village in Ellenabad (Sirsa district), the stronghold of INLD chief Abhay Chautala, Modi started his speech with a salute to Guru Nanak. “The NDA government is fortunate that the distance between our Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s holy place, Kartarpur Sahib, and all of us is now ending. In 1947, those who were responsible for drawing the dividing line did not think that the devotees should not be separated from the Guru by a distance of only 4km. Even after this, should the Congress government not have tried to erase this distance in 70 years?” Sirsa has significant presence the Sikh community. The PM also said the government would celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in a very special way to tell the entire world about its significance. Taking a jibe at Abhay over the split in the Chautala family, Modi said their (Chautalas’) fight was about distribution of “malai” (wealth), not any principle or ideology. Kashmir and Congress occupied a large part of his speech here as well. “Jammu and Ladakh regions were ignored in terms of development. Sufi culture and Sufism of Kashmir was eliminated and buried completely. More than 4 lakh Kashmiri Pandits were displaced from their homes. Some families in Kashmir used to threaten the rulers sitting in Delhi, citing special status under Article 370 but Congress sat silently and closed its eyes. Earlier, separatists or terrorists used to decide the calendar of Kashmir but now the government or the people of Kashmir shall decide their policies. Desh badal chuka hai (The country has changed now). Kashmir is (more) important than PM’s post,” said Modi. Referring to Article 370, the Modi added, “What was called temporary in Baba Ambedkar’s Constitution lasted for 70 years.” Appreciating the efforts of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to revive Saraswati, Modi promised to make Haryana “sukha mukt” (drought-free) and “jal yukt” (water filled) by launching a special Jal Jivan mission. Modi also accused Pakistan of pushing drugs into India during his rally in Sirsa, one the worst-affected Haryana districts in terms of drug addiction. The Rewari meeting was arranged at the last minute to unite the warring factions in BJP. But leaders from the faction that showed open disagreement with Union minister and Rewari stalwart Rao Inderjit Singh were missing. After the party denied ticket to his daughter Aarti Rao, Inderjit loyalist Sunil Musepur got the nod, a decision that did not go down well with BJP functionaries in Rewari. A senior BJP functionary said, “Before the second list of candidates containing 12 names came out, the mission of 75-plus seats looked achievable. Things changed once this list was announced. This created a flutter within the party and this is the primary reason why we organised additional public meetings in Rewari, Sirsa and Gohana.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

" Congress finalises position, to abide by SC verdict | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Congress seems to have settled on the position that the Supreme Court judgment on the Ayodhya issue would be final and should be accepted by all to bury the long-festering controversy for good. With the apex court judgment set to be delivered next month and the realisation that its controversial nature lends itself to differences of opinion with political consequences, the opposition party is likely to toe the safe and non-controversial line. While the party has in the past skirted controversies relating to Ayodhya by pointing to the case's pendency before the top court, questions about the final Congress stance are being asked now that the judgement is just days away. The issue gains importance in the backdrop of dissonance in Congress triggered by the Centre's decision to revoke special status to Jammu & Kashmir. Many party leaders broke from Congress's opposition of the government move to welcome the defanging of Article 370.

PM Modi openly challenged the Congress with restoring the scrapped law if it came to power and blamed the party for not ensuring proper integration of Kashmir. He said the provision had been used by the adversary to cause trouble. ""During a debate in Parliament in 1964, the country's distinguished leader got upset… there was division in the Congress. There was a demand that Article 370 be nullified and there be a debate on this issue in Parliament,"" he said. ""At that time, Congress leaders, with folded hands, had said that their demand would be met and Article 370 would be nullified in one year. But the matter was again put on the back burner,"" said Modi while addressing his second rally of the day. ""What was the compulsion and what game was being played,"" he asked, urging people to punish the Congress for it in the assembly polls. Home minister Amit Shah said that it took a   PM with '56-inch chest'   to do what Congress didn't. ""No PM ever dared to take the decision.

" BJP upbeat, opposition subdued as campaigning ends for Maharashtra, Haryana polls | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Campaigning for assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and for the bypolls in several states ended on Saturday evening with political parties going all out to woo the voters. On the last day of campaigning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi campainged in Haryana and sharpened his attack on the opposition Congress over issues of Article 370 and the Kartarpur corridor, accusing it of ""destroying the country"" with wrong policies and strategy. Raising the issue of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, Modi said what was called a temporary provision by B R Ambedkar, continued for over 70 years but the Congress did nothing about it. The main contest in Haryana is seen between the BJP, Congress and the Jannayak Janata Party. However, CM Khattar claimed that the opposition was in disarray and the BJP has no direct contest with any party. Union Home Minister and BJP chief Amit Shah led the charge in Maharashtra where he dared Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to declare that his party will restore provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir if voted to power. Addressing a rally in Maharashtra's tribal Nandurbar district, Shah said after Narendra Modi won the second term with a massive mandate in May this year, the first thing he did was to abrogate provisions of Article 370 which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. ""Due to the special provisions, Pakistan fomented terror in the state and over 40,000 people died. Development in Kashmir came to a standstill. But Congress was not ready to scrap the provisions. It was worried about its vote bank and not about the national interest. No PM ever dared to take the decision. It was Modi with his 56-inch chest who made the move,"" he said. Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is seeking a second term, held a massive roadshow in Nagpur city, to garner votes for the BJP. Fadnavis is contesting the polls, scheduled to be held on October 21, from Nagpur South West seat. From Opposition's perspective, it was perhaps the most lacklustre canvassing with the exception of a few rallies addressed by Rahul Gandhi who highlighted issues like the economic slowdown, unemployment, ""failure"" of demonetisation exercise and GST rollout. For the Opposition, Sharad Pawar seemed to be the only saving grace who hit the hustings at the age of 79 and addressed a number of rallies in which he attacked PM Modi and BJP on a string of issues. Pawar took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah for attacking him during the poll campaigning. ""I feel that after taking my name the whole day, they must be taking my name in their sleep as well,"" he joked. The NCP chief also hit out at Shah for questionning his contribution to Maharashtra. Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant expressed hope that people will give a mandate against the ruling government on October 21, day of voting. He equated chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' tenure since 2014 with ""dictatorship"". However, the Congress and NCP failed to hold even a single joint rally in contrast to the joint rally held by the Prime Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai on October 18.

" Modi steps up offensive against Cong, says 'Kashmir situation worsened because govt remained in slumber' | India News - Times of India","ELLENABAD (HARYANA): On the last day of campaigning for the Haryana assembly polls here, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sharpened his attack on the opposition Congress over issues of Article 370 and the Kartarpur corridor, accusing it of ""destroying the country"" with wrong policies and strategy. Raising the issue of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, Modi here in a rally said what was called a temporary provision by B R Ambedkar, continued for over 70 years but the Congress did nothing about it. The situation in Kashmir worsened as the government in Delhi remained in slumber, he said. ""The wrong policies and strategy of the Congress have destroyed the nation,"" he said, stressing that it was people of India and Kashmir who will frame policies now. ""Time has changed, country has changed,"" he said. Justifying the scrapping of provisions of Article 370 for Jammu and Kashmir, Modi said, ""Should Kashmir have been allowed to be destroyed for the sake of power in Delhi? Should Kashmir be more important or post of a prime minister? Every Indian's reply is the same that PMs will come and go, Kashmir has to remain and prosper."" He said for 70 years, ""no honest efforts"" were made to find a meaningful solution to the issue even after innocents kept dying in J&K while the jawans sacrificed their lives for the safety and security of citizens there. He also accused the Congress of opposing the government move with regard to Jammu and Kashmir. On the Kartarpur corridor, which links historic Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the final resting place of Guru Nanak in Pakistan, to Dera Baba Nanak in Indian Punjab's Gurdaspur, Modi said it was nearly completion and the Centre had been making arrangements to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of the Sikhism founder in a grand manner. ""The inability to bring the Kartarpur gurdwara within the Indian territory was a mistake made during the Partition,"" he said, adding that the Congress did not make efforts to ensure that devotees ""were not separated from their guru"". ""But the Congress and those parties connected with their culture, never gave respect to the belief, tradition and culture of the Indians,"" he said. ""What has been the Congress' approach towards our holy places, the same approach they had towards Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. Attacking the Congress, he said, ""The government which was in slumber in Delhi worsened the Kashmir situation. Initially, a portion of our territory was snatched away from us and became Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir."" ""A few years later, Kashmir's Sufi tradition was buried. Its roots were shaken,"" he said, stressing that the Sufi tradition of Kashmir gave the message of unity and brotherhood. ""But those sitting in Delhi could not see this. They thought if they take care of one or two families, Kashmir will be taken care of. Allow these one or two families to do whatever they want ... if they have to loot, let them ... if people are destroyed, let them be...Kashmir will be controlled...such things continued,"" said Modi in a stinging attack. He said later ""discrimination and injustice"" started with Jammu, Ladakh and Kargil. Referring to the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley due to militancy nearly three decades ago, Modi said, ""Then a trick was played when more than four lakh Kashmiri Pandit families were forced to leave their homes in the Valley, a few of them were killed, their houses burnt down and some of the women were raped."" ""Those sitting in Delhi turned a blind eye to what was happening in Kashmir,"" he said. ""And therefore, I ended this temporary provision. When you made me permanent for five years, why would I allow this temporary thing to continue,"" he said. On the sharing of river waters with Pakistan, Modi said India would not allow its water to flow to Pakistan, saying for 70 years ""our rivers kept flowing to Pakistan and our governments failed to act"". ""You tell me, should we allow our water flow to Pakistan. Is this acceptable that our fields remain parched while Pakistan remaining green (harabhara)? How can it happen? You have the right over this water and I will not allow a single drop of water flow to Pakistan,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" No separate flag, Constitution for Nagas; talks can't be held under shadow of guns: Governor Ravi | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Centre has ruled out a separate flag and Constitution for the Nagas as demanded by the NSCN-IM, and made it clear that the endless negotiations with the insurgent group under the shadow of guns is not acceptable. Interlocutor for the Naga talks and Nagaland governor R N Ravi also said that the Central government is determined to conclude the decades long peace process without delay. In a statement, Ravi said a mutually agreed draft comprehensive settlement, including all the substantive issues and competencies, is ready for inking the final agreement. ""Unfortunately at this auspicious juncture, the NSCN-IM has adopted a procrastinating attitude to delay the settlement raising the contentious symbolic issues of separate Naga national flag and constitution on which they are fully aware of the Government of India's position,"" the statement, issued last night, read. Ravi's statement bears significance as the central government on August 5 announced abrogation of special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and bifurcated the state into Union territories. With the annulment of the special status, the separate flag and the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir cease to exist. The ruling BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on many occasions had made it clear that they believe in only one flag and one Constitution for whole India. Ravi said the NSCN-IM has ""mischievously"" dragged in the Framework Agreement and began imputing imaginary contents to it. The framework agreement was signed on August 3, 2015 by NSCN-IM general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah and the government's interlocutor Ravi in presence of Prime Minister Modi. Ravi said in the statement that some NSCN-IM leaders through various media platforms are misleading the people with ""absurd assumptions and presumptions"" over what they have already agreed with the Government of India. In view of such unfortunate attitude of some NSCN-IM leaders, Ravi held a detailed consultation meeting with the primary stakeholders of the Naga society on October 18 in Kohima. The meeting was attended by the apex leadership of all the 14 Naga tribes of Nagaland, all the minority non-Naga tribes of Nagaland, the Nagaland Gaon Burha Federation, the Nagaland Tribes Council, church leaders and civil society organisations. The framework agreement with the (NSCN-IM) and the agreed position with the working committee of Naga National Political Groups were extensively shared with the leaders, pertinent issues discussed and doubts on competencies clarified. Political maturity and wisdom of the Naga leaders who expressed their overwhelming support in favour of a settlement without any further delay is deeply appreciated, the statement said. ""Respecting the Naga people's wishes, the Government of India is determined to conclude the peace process without delay. Endless negotiation under the shadow of guns is not acceptable,"" it said. The Government of India expect all negotiating parties to heed the will of the people, and facilitate conclusion of the Naga peace process within the stipulated time, it said. The framework agreement came after over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 18 years, with the first breakthrough made in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed after decades of insurgency in Nagaland which started soon after India's independence in 1947. Ravi said the Government of India under the dynamic and decisive leadership of Modi has been determined and diligent to honourably conclude the Naga peace process, which has been going on for the last over 22 years. As a result, the Naga peace process, in the last five years, has become truly inclusive and reached the conclusion stage. All Naga armed groups are engaged with the Government of India's interlocutor and have worked out the draft final settlement. Primary stakeholders — tribal and civil society organisations from Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam — were involved in the peace process and made valuable contributions through regular consultations and insightful inputs, the statement said. The church leaders with their constant prayers and goodwill have immensely contributed to the cause of enduring peace. ""It is a matter of great satisfaction that agreements — with NSCN-IM on August 3, 2015 and with seven Naga armed groups under the banner of Working Committee (WC) of Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) on November 17, 2017 — on the political parameters of the settlement were signed,"" the statement said.

They said the curbs, under Section 144 of the CrPC, were imposed in Anchar area under the jurisdiction of Soura police station and the areas around the historic Jamia Masjid in Nowhatta police station on Friday morning. They were imposed as a precautionary measure to maintain law and order in view of the Friday congregational prayers. The restrictions have been lifted from parts of the city here, the officials said. Authorities have been imposing curbs in vulnerable areas of the valley on Friday, apprehending that vested interests may exploit the large gatherings at big mosques and shrines to fuel protests. Friday prayers have not been allowed at Jamia Masjid – the grand mosque of Kashmir in Downtown (old city area) - for over two months. Meanwhile, normal life remained affected across the valley. Shops opened for a few hours early in the morning in some areas, including in the commercial hub of Lal Chowk in the city here, but the main markets and other business establishments were shut, the officials said. Private transport plied unhindered in the city here and elsewhere in Kashmir, the officials said, adding few areas in the city witnessed traffic jams. Auto-rickshaws and few inter-district cabs were also seen plying in some areas of the valley, they said. However, the other modes of public transport were off the roads. Schools and colleges were open, but the students stayed away as parents continued to keep them at home due to apprehensions about their safety, the officials said. Mobile services were restored in Kashmir earlier this week, but the SMS facility was snapped again hours later due to apprehensions of the services being misused. Internet services, across all platforms, continued to remain snapped in the valley, they added. Most of the top-level and second-rung separatist politicians have been taken into preventive custody, while mainstream leaders, including two former chief ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, have been either detained or placed under house arrest. Another former chief minister and sitting Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar Farooq Abdullah has been arrested under the controversial Public Safety act, a law enacted by his father and National Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978 when he was the chief minister.

Yogi Adityanath harps on Article 370 while wooing voters in Gangoh | Meerut News - Times of India,"MEERUT: Revocation of the special status bestowed upon the state of J&K under Article 370 dominated Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s speech at Nanota village on Saharanpur, where he was speaking in favour of Kirat Pal, BJP candidate for Gangoh bypoll. Gangoh is one of the 11 assembly constituencies of UP where elections will be held on October 21. “Even Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution had warned Congress government against special status to J&K but it silently introduced the provision and converted ‘swarg’ to ‘nark’ (heaven to hell) forever, triggering exodus of Hindus and Sikhs (from the Valley) and only a few families became relevant in the state,” Yogi said. Besides Kashmir, Yogi said, the decision to criminalize triple talaq is yet another historical step taken by the BJP-led government at the Centre. The move has given equal rights to women, he added. At the same time, Yogi did not shy away from patting his own back on “improving law and order in the state” despite Supreme Court’s displeasure over the deteriorating law and order in the state. “We are determined to provide security to everyone in the state and no one will be allowed to take law into his hands. For criminals, we have only two places reserved -- either in jail or with Yamraj,” said the CM.

 India slams Pakistan for raising Kashmir issue at UN | India News - Times of India,"UNITED NATIONS: India has slammed Pakistan for raising the issue of Jammu and Kashmir at a forum of the UN, saying the country employs ""empty rhetoric"" to serve its ""distorted agenda"" and continues to engage in spreading unsubstantiated allegations. Minister in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Deepak Misra did not name Pakistan but his remarks were in response to a statement by Islamabad's UN envoy Maleeha Lodhi, who while speaking at forum last week, had yet again raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Lodhi had said that UN's decolonisation agenda will remain incomplete without the resolution of the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and refereed to India's decision to revoke Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. ""We have one delegation which has a penchant for deviating from the subject being deliberated upon in this august forum and making unwarranted remarks not pertinent to the agenda on hand,"" Misra said on Wednesday. ""It seeks to employ empty rhetoric to serve its distorted agenda and continues to engage in spreading malevolent and unsubstantiated allegations,” he said. Misra, addressing the committee, said that since the creation of the United Nations, more than 80 former colonies have gained their independence and joined the family of United Nations. As a result of sustained efforts by the UN membership, today, fewer than two million people live in non-self-governing territories, according to UN documentation. However, he noted that even as seven decades have gone by, the process of decolonisation that began with India's own independence remains unfinished. ""There still remain 17 non-self-governing territories, which are in various stages of the decolonisation process” on the agenda of this Committee. He underscored the need to step up international efforts to conclude this long-drawn process. ""In this inter-connected world, India strongly believes that pursuing a pragmatic approach towards decolonisation would surely lead to fulfillment of legitimate wishes of the people of Non-Self Governing Territories. The complex challenges facing the present world can only be met by coordinating our responses in a spirit of cooperation and collaboration,” Misra said. He added that the international community must strive to enhance cooperation with international agencies and actors and channelise resources for the 17 non-self governing territories that would enable them to build capacities in their just and noble quest towards achieving long cherished goals. Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for its decision to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcate the state into two union territories. After India's decision on August 5, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner from the country.

 Modi misleading nation on Article 370 vote: Congress | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: There was no vote in Parliament on the abrogation of provisions of Article 370, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was misleading the nation on the issue, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma claimed here on Friday. Addressing a press conference ahead of the October 21 Maharashtra assembly polls, Sharma said the Congress did not need a certificate from the BJP on patriotism, as two of its prime ministers sacrificed their lives in the fight against terror. Modi and the BJP have been targeting the Congress during the campaign for assembly polls, claiming that the grand old party opposed the scrapping of Article 370. ""Article 370 was a temporary provision which was to go in a span of time. Parliament only needs to be notified about it. On August 5-6, the government informed Parliament and there was no vote. ""The voting was on Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganisation) Bill 2019 that sought to bifurcate it into Union Territories. The Congress opposed the bifurcation,"" he claimed.

Congress doesn't need a certificate on patriotism and how to counterterrorism. ""Two (Congress) PMs sacrificed their lives fighting terrorism and protecting the integrity of the country,"" he said. He said the Indian Army belonged to everybody and not to any particular party, and lashed out at BJP leaders for claiming that then prime minister Indira Gandhi exploited the victory in the 1971 war with Pakistan to garner votes. ""The Congress-led by Indira Gandhi won 2/3rd majority in the Lok Sabha polls held in March 1971 whereas the Indo-Pak war took place between December 3-16 that year,"" he pointed out. Criticising BJP chief and Union home minister Amit Shah's statement that history needed to be rewritten from India's point of view, Sharma said ""history can't be changed"". Referring to BJP's contention that J&K was only now fully integrated with India, Sharma said, ""The Constituent Assembly of the state was dissolved 65 years ago with a resolution that accession to India was final and irrevocable."" He said BJP's poll manifesto promise to bestow Bharat Ratna on Veer Savarkar showed that the party's celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi was a ""farce"", and termed the demand as one made with an eye on Maharashtra polls. ""Why was no decision (on Bharat Ratna for Savarkar) taken in the past five-and-half years? Why was it (the award) not given during (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee's tenure as PM?"" he asked. He said BJP's promise to implement National Register of Citizens across the country was designed to ""create a scare"" as the Supreme Court has said the exercise was Assam- specific. ""The BJP has nothing to show to the public by way of performance of their governments,"" he said.

Congress didn’t oppose Jammu &amp; Kashmir decision: Manmohan Singh | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Former PM and Congress leader Manmohan Singh said on Thursday that the Congress had not opposed but supported the proposal to revoke Article 370 giving special status to Jammu & Kashmir in both houses of Parliament. “We are not opposed to (the move to scrap) Article 370. Our contention is that the NDA government could not secure the goodwill of the people of J&K owing to high-handedness at all levels,” he said. On the state government’s proposal to confer the Bharat Ratna on Veer Savarkar, Singh said the Congress was never against Savarkar but was against the ideology of Hindutva promoted by him. “None other than Indira Gandhi, when she was Prime Minister, had taken the lead in releasing a postal stamp in memory of Savarkar,” he noted. PM Modi had on Wednesday defended the mention of revoking of Article 370 as an election issue by saying that many soldiers from Maharashtra had sacrificed their lives while battling terrorists in the troubled state. Terming the opposition as “shameless,” the PM told them “doob maro” (go drown) for their stance on the issue. “Look at their faces, they looked dejected and their glow has gone after their plans were foiled. I want them to hear clearly that Kashmir and its people will stay with Mother India. All Indian citizens are with them in fighting terrorism sponsored by the neighbouring country. There is not a single district where soldiers have not sacrificed their lives for maintaining peace in Kashmir,” he had said at a poll rally in the state. The PM had also said that it was due to Savarkar’s “sanskar” (values) that “we consider nationalism as the basis for nationbuilding.” Modi had then added that the Congress had insulted “Babasaheb Ambedkar by delaying the Bharat Ratna for him.” “They abuse freedom fighters like Savarkar, Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Phule and others. Now they’re asking what Article 370 has to do with the Maharashtra elections. For all these years, they had deliberately kept this provision in Kashmir for their obvious vested interests.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
AMU administration forcibly stops Kashmiri students from going on hunger strike | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: A few Kashmiri students, led by former vice-president of Aligarh Muslim University Students’ Union (AMUSU), were forcibly removed by the authorities on Thursday after they staged a hunger strike to protest against the lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir. The strike coincided with the annual Sir Syed Day celebrations. Over 1,000 Kashmiris studying in the university, however, stayed away from the protest claiming that the Valley situation has nothing to do with the founder’s day celebrations. Former vice-president of AMUSU, Sajjad Subhan Rathar, who led the strike, was taken away to the proctor’s office, where he was counselled by a proctorial team. He, however, was not allowed to go out of the office till evening. Speaking to media, before being taken away by the administration, Rathar alleged that the varsity administration was following BJP government’s agenda and dictates and was suppressing his voice. He said, “Protest is our democratic right but we are not being allowed to speak on Kashmir issue.” Proctor of the varsity Afifullah Khan said that their team members counselled him and let him go. He added Sir Syed Day is a very auspicious day for the varsity, as he is highly revered and respected by the AMU fraternity across the globe. He said every student should participate in the celebrations instead of protesting. “We are hopeful of having conveyed the message to him in a right way,” he added. On Wednesday, Rathar had claimed that Kashmiri students in AMU would boycott the annual Sir Syed Day celebrations including the traditional dinner to express their anguish over the situation in the Valley following the abrogation of Article 370. However, other Kashmiri students studying in AMU dubbed Rathar as an “opportunist” as he allegedly uses Kashmiris to draw political mileage. Students said that he has no right to represent all Kashmiris and whatever statement he issues represents his personal stand not the collective voice of all Kashmiri students. National spokesperson of J&K Students Association, Nasir Khuehami, said Rathar is the ex-VP of the AMUSU, not the leader of Kashmiri students. He added that taking refuge in Kashmiri struggle to foster his aspiration of a political career is condemning. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Manmohan Singh: Fix the economy, stop blaming UPA: Manmohan Singh to government | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday said his successor Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman should stop blaming the UPA regime for the crisis in the economy as the NDA had been in office for over five years which is ""long enough period"" for a government ""to do some credible things"". ""When I was in office, what happened did happen. There were some weaknesses, but you can't claim the fault lies with UPA always. Mainly passing the buck to UPA is not enough. The government is obsessed with trying to somehow fix the blame on its opponents. In the process, it is unable to find a solution that will ensure the revival of the economy, particularly strengthening of our banking system,"" said Singh, speaking at a Congress meet on the state of the economy. A couple of days ago, Sitharaman had said Indian public sector banks had their ""worst phase"" when Singh was the PM and Raghuram Rajan was RBI governor. Highlighting what he called NDA's utter failure on the economic front, former PM Manmohan Singh said: ""With growth rate declining year after year, I don't think there's any hope of economy reaching the target of $5 trillion by 2024."" On the PMC Bank crisis, Singh asked Modi and Sitharaman to address the plight of 16 lakh depositors as a top priority. ""Indeed, it is unfortunate that lakhs are suffering following the fraud involving officials and directors of the bank."" The former PM strongly defended NCP leader Praful Patel who has been summoned by ED on Friday in connection with a financial deal involving Hajra Iqbal Memon, wife of the late drug lord Iqbal Memon ""Mirchi"". He said ED's action appears to be an act of political vendetta. ""Our laws are clear. So long as he is not guilty, he is considered as innocent. In my opinion, central agencies should not be used to settle political scores against rivals."" The former PM clarified that Congress had not opposed but supported the proposal to nullify Article 370 in Parliament. ""We are not opposed to (the move on) Article 370.

Maharashtra elections: 'Shiv Sena pact with BJP was due to move on Article 370' | Mumbai News - Times of India,"THANE/MUMBAI: Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said his party's decision to seal a pre-poll pact with BJP was largely influenced by the Modi regime's move to scrap the controversial Article 370. The announcement is largely seen as an attempt to silence critics who have been raising questions over the party's move to accommodate for lesser seats in the alliance. The announcement gains importance especially after Modi recently dared political opponents to rewind Article 370 in the Valley. The Sena president, in Thane to campaign for saffron alliance candidates, praised the 'nationalism' of Veer Savarkar as he forcefully iterated the demand for a Bharat Ratna to be conferred on him. The support for Bharat Ratna could help Sena not only find favour among Marathi-speaking people in Thane, which also has a sizeable Hindu population, but also grow closer to BJP, that has been idealising Savarkar. Earlier, in Manvelpada, Virar (E) to campaign for Nalasopara candidate, Pradeep Sharma, and Vasai candidate, Vijay Patil, he said, in Vasai-Virar, water does not come from taps, it comes from doors, referring to flooding in the region this year.

 New lifeline to J&amp;K apple growers as Nafed opens 2 more centres | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: As the procurement of apples picks up pace in J&K, state-owned Nafed has opened two more new procurement centres in Handwara and Pulwama and as till Thursday nearly 4.5 lakh tonnes of apples have been transported out of the state, a large share by private players. Nafed, which has so far procured nearly 1,700 tonnes in the past one month under a special push in the wake of the post Article 370 restrictions, hopes to significantly add to this over the next twothree months. The key trade has been targeted by terrorists who are well aware of the economic significance of the business and the normalcy it will convey. Hurting the trade increases the frustration of the local populace and builds up resentment against the government and the Nafed intervention is proving a useful lifeline for the apple business. Sources said maximum procurement by all agencies including Nafed has been reported from Anantnag. ""We are making preparations for disposing stock that we will get and are also getting space on hire for storage,"" said a central government official. According to estimates by the J&K government, the total apple production this season would be approximately 12 lakh tonnes and Nafed has set a target to procure nearly four lakh tonnes. Sources said the quantum of procurement has increased since Nafed revised minimum support price (MSP) for the best quality apple from Rs 54 in September to Rs 60 in this month.

""Unlike them (experts), it is not just a figure for us. It is our resolve. We are aware of the reality but we have the confidence,"" Modi said at a rally in Pune. The PM, who had articulated this aspiration during his Independence Day speech, said, ""For the initial 60 years, we were just a one-trillion-dollar economy.

Our foreign policies are being well appreciated.

The PM said India's economy was full of opportunities for the youth and the recent policy decisions, including tax reforms and allowing foreign direct investment, would further boost its growth. The government is also planning to pump in over Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure projects, he said. ""The nature of employment is changing. Skill upgradation is the key,"" he said. Modi tried to strike a chord with the crowd in Pune by opening his speech with remarks in Marathi, "" Kasa kai Punekar?"" (How are you, Punekars?).

 World can see new-found confidence of New India: PM Modi | India News - Times of India,"PUNE: The entire world can see the new-found confidence of New India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said here on Thursday. Addressing BJP's campaign rallies for the October 21 Maharashtra Assembly elections at Pune, Satara and Parli, Modi also said that despite a lot of talk in the last 70 years, it was only his government which dared abrogate Article 370. ""The entire world can see the new-found confidence of New India. Everyone can feel the change. They are discussing HowdyModi (event in the US),"" Modi said at the Pune rally. ""Haven't you felt the effect of the New India in the last 100 days of our second term? Do you see its power? Do you see its decision-making abilities and clarity in ideas?"" Modi asked the crowds. ""Since the last 70 years, the entire country was facing the hurdle of Article 370. There was a lot of talk to remove it, but no one dared to do it. Was this the first government in India with a full majority? No, it is not,"" he said. Modi said the decision (to abrogate Article 370) wasn't an easy one to make. ""Whenever we bring a change to the ongoing situation, protests are expected. But the India of 21st century will not stop at the ongoing situation, and isn't afraid of changes,"" he said. History will take note of those who mocked Article 370 removal: PM ModiThe government has recently taken a lot of measures to bolster the economy, Modi said. ""We have taken steps to promote manufacturing, start-ups, and have given sops in corporate tax,"" he said. 'Doob maro': PM Modi tells opposition over stance on Article 370""Our government will take every step needed for the bright future of the Indian youth and investment,"" he said. India today is one of the top-FDI friendly countries in the world, Modi said. ""Every business leader I have had a discussion with globally is keen to come to India. The growth in investment in India in the last five years has been five times,"" he said. Be it the government, businessmen or the youth, everyone needs to stay ready for the new economy of New India, he said. At the rally in Satara, Modi asserted that his government adheres to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's principles of nationalism and national security, and possess the strength to give a befitting reply to those who have ""evil designs"" on India. Modi said that as Shivaji Maharaj did, his government too has worked to strengthen the defence forces. ""In the last five years, our government has brought our armed forces at par with the armed forces of other countries. Be it Army, Navy or Air Force, modern weapons are a part of our armed forces today,"" he said. The Centre and the state government have adhered to the values of Shivaji Maharaj in the last five years, he said. ""Nationalism and national security are our top priority. Those having evil designs against the country will be given a befitting reply,"" he said. ""We have taken decisions for national integration which earlier governments had no guts to take,"" he said. Hitting out at the Congress-NCP, Modi said the two parties opposed decisions taken in the interest of national security and national integration. The Congress and NCP questioned the bravery of our soldiers, he alleged. ""They even spread false propaganda against Rafale (the deal to buy the French-made fighter jets) and their stand on abrogation of Article 370 has hurt the people of Satara,"" Modi said. ""They leave no chance to malign Veer Savarkar. Congress and NCP does not understand national sentiment. They were taught a lesson in the Lok Sabha elections and now Maharashtra and Haryana will also punish them severely (in Assembly elections and bypolls),"" he said. Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan refused to contest the Satara by-poll as he knew the outcome, Modi said. ""Then the issue of (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar entering the fray came up. But, Sharadrao being Sharadrao, he knows which way the wind is blowing and hence refused to contest,"" Modi said.

 India pushes back at warped narrative on Kashmir issue | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: A concerted pushback by India against what it considers a warped narrative on the Kashmir issue included countering “ridiculously false” claims that New Delhi was piping in “Hindu music” into the Valley to indoctrinate its largely Muslim population. This was just one of the several concerns voiced by US lawmakers on Wednesday to group of Indian diplomats led by India’s ambassador to the US Harsh Vardhan Shringla as it sought to brief them about the ground situation in Kashmir ahead of a Congressional hearing on October 22. The hearing, which has been broadened to survey “Human Rights in South Asia,” will include testimony by Fatima Gul, a Sindhi-American human rights activist, and Francisco Bencosme of the Amnesty International, among others. Indian ambassador briefs US lawmakers on ground situation in KashmirChanneling concerns relayed by their constituents, some of which New Delhi views as valid and others exaggerated or outright false, lawmakers also questioned the Indian team about use of pellet guns, custodial issues, communications lockdown, and lack of access to the region for foreign correspondents. Officials said they apprised lawmakers of the use of pellet guns in only extenuating circumstances (such as rioting which could result in loss of life) and asserted that communications were being restored gradually, with the prime aim of preventing he misuse of facilities such as pre-paid telephony by terrorists who have previously abused the system to carry out terrorist attacks. The important thing was preventing loss of life, which New Delhi had succeeded in doing to a large extent, much to the dismay of those who were eager to see a bloodbath. Officials also pushed back against claims of custodial disappearance of young men from the Valley and offered to address any such cases. But only one such case had been brought to their notice by a US lawmaker and communication has since been established between the detainee and his family. “The sense we got was there is a lot of sensationalism and exaggeration and deliberate misinformation and misleading that is happening as part of what some constituents are telling some Congressmen,” a senior Indian official said of the briefing, noting that most of the lawmakers did not question the fundamental issue of India’s sovereignty over Jammu & Kashmir and its right to conduct its own internal affairs. Some 20 lawmakers, mostly Democrats (and their staffers) filtered in an out of the briefing room on a rainy day in the capital awash with a myriad foreign policy issues, of which the Syria-Turkey-Kurds problem remained center stage. The briefing was convened by California Congressman Brad Sherman, who heads the House sub-committee on Asia and the Pacific, and who will also preside over the October 22 hearing. Separately, a group of Kashmiri Pandits also came to the Capitol to brief lawmakers about their heritage and the ethnic cleansing they suffered at the hands of extremists in Kashmir.

 Manmohan govt had totally failed on every economic parameter: Piyush Goyal | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Training guns at the Congress party, Union minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said that former prime minister Manmohan Singh-led government had totally failed on all economic parameters. ""When we (BJP) came to power, we inherited an economy with double-digit inflation. During Manmohan Singh government, fiscal deficit was over 6.1 per cent and current account deficit was over 2 per cent. In every economic parameter, Manmohan Singh government had failed completely,"" he told ANI. ""In spite of being such an eminent economist, Manmohan Singh reflected either some compulsions or complete lack of understanding of economics and business. Of course, it doesn't surprise me because we saw some of the worst scams and governance under the UPA regime,"" Goyal said. In view of the impending Assembly elections in Maharashtra, Goyal also took a dig at former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan saying his government was ""non-functional"" in the state. ""UPA gave a double-engine government at the Centre and in Maharashtra, double-engine of corruption, ineptitude and bad governance, inefficiency and infighting within the alliance,"" he added. The Union minister said, in contrast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government and Devendra Fadnavis' government in Maharashtra have worked together to revive the economy.

 Digvijaya not even dust of Savarkar’s feet: Shivraj Singh Chouhan | India News - Times of India,"BHOPAL: In retaliation to Congress leader Digvijaya Singh’s remarks against Bharat Ratna for Veer Savarkar, BJP national vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Thursday that Digvijaya is not even the dust of Savarkar’s feet. He said the entire world knows about his sacrifice and bestowing of Bharat Ratna over Veer Savarkar is an honour to patriotism. “Digvijaya Singh should visit Andaman and Nicobar to see the Cellular Jail where Veer Savarkar was detained by the British Rule. He was punished for two lives. His real brother was detailed in the next cell for many years, but he was not aware. In the jail, Savarkar wrote and sang bhajans playing fetters to pray for Mother India. Digvijaya is not even the dust of Savarkar’s feet,” said Chouhan in reply to the Congress leader’s remarks. Digvijaya had on Wednesday hit out at BJP for proposing Veer Savarkar’s name for the Bharat Ratna saying, “Savarkar’s life had two aspects. First his participation in the independence struggle and when he came back after seeking an apology (to the British). BJP shall not forget that his name was registered in a conspiracy behind Mahatma Gandhi’s murder.” Digvijaya also referred the manifesto released by the BJP for Maharashtra elections which had a page on Bharat Ratna awards in which the party proposed the names of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, Savitribai Phule and Veer Savarkar for the country’s highest civilian award. Making a scathing attack on involving BJP in the matter, Chouhan said Savarkar was a great patriot, thinker, ideologue and revolutionary. The entire world knows about his bravery and contribution to the struggle for Independence. Those raising objections over the proposals seeking Bharat Ratna for Savarkar also know him well, he said. “Those who barb comments can do so, but the entire world knows how Savarkar dedicated his life for the nation. Bestowing upon the highest civilian award Bharat Ratna upon him would be an honour to patriotism,” said Chouhan. In August, Digvijaya had responded in a similar way on Chouhan’s remark that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was a ‘criminal’, who committed the crime of imposing Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and also of announcing ‘cease-fire’ in war with Pakistan. Digvijaya had said, “Nehruji ke pairon ki dhool bhi nahi hain Shivraj, sharam aani chahiye unko.” (Shivraj is not even the dust of Nehru’s feet, he should be ashamed).

" Hooda counters BJP's nationalism pitch, says Pakistan split into two under Congress rule | India News - Times of India","UCHANA (HARYANA): Strongly countering the BJP's nationalism pitch in the Haryana Assembly poll campaign, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda asserted that it was the Congress which secured Independence and it was under its rule that Pakistan split into two. Hooda also criticised Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for his remarks against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi recently, saying a person sitting in a position of responsibility should make responsible comments. ""Anyone making irresponsible statements should be condemned"", he said, in reference to Khattar using the Hindi proverb ""khoda pahad nikli chuhiya"" while mocking the Congress' efforts to find Rahul Gandhi's replacement. In an interview to PTI while flying from one campaign venue to another on a helicopter, Hooda said the assembly polls, slated for October 21, are a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP in Haryana as both the JJP and the INLD have become ""irrelevant"". Hooda's remarks dismissing the Jannayak Janta Party and the Indian National Lok Dal as having ""no role"" post polls come after Congress's former Haryana unit president Ashok Tanwar announced his support for Dushyant Chautala-led JJP. Asked about the BJP's claims of getting 75 plus seats in the 90-member assembly, Hooda said, ""Hawa palat chuki hai (the wind has changed direction)."" The Congress' election management committee chief also asserted that his party would get an ""absolute majority"" and form the next government. ""There is a wave in favour of the Congress. Based on the support the party is getting, I believe a Congress government is going to be formed in Haryana,"" he said on his way from Uklana in Hisar to Uchana in the state's Jind district. Asked about the BJP aggressively raising the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir during the election campaign, Hooda said, ""As far as Article 370 is concerned, the whole country knows about my views. But it is not an election issue as it has now become a law."" ""It is the law of the land and nobody is opposing it,"" the two-time chief minister said, adding that there is only one issue now and that is establishing peace in Kashmir. On the BJP making nationalism and Article 370 its main poll plank, he said, ""Congress ke samay mein toh Pakistan ke do tukde ho gaye the (Under the Congress rule, Pakistan split into two). This (Article 370) is not an issue."" ""The issues for electing Members of Parliament were different while the issues of these polls are different ... local issues are important. The BJP government had made 154 promises, but it has not fulfilled even one and because of this all sections — be it farmers, traders, officials, labourers — are not happy,"" the 72-year-old leader said. ""Everyone is a nationalist. Who is not a nationalist in this country? My father was a nationalist, my grandfather was a freedom fighter. It was the Congress that secured independence for the country,"" he said. In a bid to end factionalism in the party ahead of assembly polls in Haryana, the Congress last month named Kumari Selja as chief of its state unit and appointed Hooda chairperson of the election management committee. Congress president Sonia Gandhi also appointed Hooda the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader. Asked if he could be the next chief minister of the state, Hooda evaded a direct answer, saying the aim right now is to form a Congress government. ""In national parties, the sitting chief minister is the face. And in the case of someone who is not the sitting CM, the MLAs and the high command decide. This is true for both the Congress and the BJP,"" he asserted. On people at rallies saying he is their CM choice, he remarked that it was ""people's sentiments"". Dismissing Tanwar's backing to the JJP, he said a person who has resigned from the party can go anywhere he wants and support anybody. The veteran leader also dismissed the ""Modi factor"" in polls, saying people are talking about the failures of the Haryana government and the achievements of his government between 2005-14. ""People will not get diverted, they are intelligent,"" he asserted. Highlighting the promises made by his party in its manifesto, Hooda said loans of farmers will be waived. Talking about key poll issues, he said, ""Unemployment is the biggest issue. Unemployment rate that was at 2.8 per cent has increased 10 times to 28 per cent, highest in the country. No new industry is coming up. The government is busy in event management."" Hooda also asserted there is no infighting in the Haryana Congress and all are united.

" Congress backed scrapping of Article 370, but not BJP's high-handed way: Manmohan Singh | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The Congress does not need a certificate of patriotism from anyone, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Thursday, pointing out that it voted in favour of the abrogation of Article 370, but opposed the high-handed way in which it was done. The economist-turned-politician also said that agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) should not be used to settle ""political scores"". Singh's comments came at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP have been attacking Congress on Article 370 during the campaign for the Maharashtra assembly polls, while NCP leaders including Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel are being investigated by the ED in various cases. Addressing a press conference here, Singh said the Congress opposes the ""high-handedness"" with which Article 370 of the Constitution -- which gave a special status to Jammu and Kashmir -- was introduced in Parliament. Earning goodwill of the people of Jammu & Kashmir was necessary before such a move, the former prime minister said. ""Congress voted in favour of the move (the abrogation) in Parliament, not against it. Congress feels that Article 370 is a temporary measure, but if a change is to be brought, it has to be with the goodwill of the people of J&K,"" he said. The ED, under the NDA regime, has got more powers than ever, and should not be used for political vendetta against leaders of ""different hues"", Singh said. ""Our hope is these powers will be used not to settle political scores,"" he said, expressing confidence that the government will do justice to Praful Patel. Asked about the BJP's poll promise to seek Bharat Ratna for V D Savarkar, who was an accused in the Mahatma Gandhi assassination case but was acquitted, Singh said the Congress only opposes Savarkar's Hindutva ideology. Referring to the Hindu Mahasabha leader with a reverential ""Savarkar-ji"", Singh said former Congress prime minister, late Indira Gandhi had issued a postal stamp in Savarkar's memory. ""(But) we are not in favour of the Hindutva ideology that Savarkar-ji patronised and stood for,"" Singh said. Singh also hit out against the NDA government's Citizenship Amendment Bill, calling it a divisive move that discriminates against the Muslims by facilitating Indian citizenship for persons of all faiths except Muslims. He also claimed that for the first time in the history of Parliament such a divisive bill has been tabled. On the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise in Assam, Singh said the BJP expected that it will exclude Muslims, but 12 lakh out of the 19 lakh people who could not establish their citizenship status were Bengali Hindus. There is a need to look at things in objective manner in matters such as the NRC, and while people would want to identify foreign nationals and ensure they do not get any benefits, we need to look at the issue with full sympathy as a ""human problem"", Singh said. Congress does not need anyone's certificate about its patriotic credentials, as its record during the freedom struggle is well-known, he said, adding that the BJP or its parent RSS were not part of the nationalist movement.

Those having evil designs against the country will be given a befitting reply,"" he said. ""We took decisions for national integration which the earlier governments did not have guts to take,"" he said. Hitting out at the Congress and NCP, Modi said they opposed decisions taken for national security and integration, which caused a ""deep hurt"" to Satara district, which sends maximum number of soldiers in the Indian Army. ""In the land of 'rashtra rakshaks' (protectors of nation), there is no place for those who speak against the national interest. Your excitement, energy is making the opposition lose its sense,"" he told the gathering. Modi said the Congress and NCP questioned the bravery of soldiers. ""They even spread mispropaganda against Rafale (fighter jet deal with France) and their stand on abrogation of Article 370 has hurt the people of Satara. They leave no chance to malign (Hindutva ideologue) Veer Savarkar,"" he said. Congress and NCP do not understand the national sentiment. ""They have been taught a lesson in the Lok Sabha elections and now Maharashtra and Haryana will also punish them severely (in the Assembly polls),"" he said. Modi also said that NCP chief Sharad Pawar did not contest Lok Sabha polls from Satara as he knew which way the ""wind was blowing"". He also said that it felt like a pilgrimage to visit Satara, the native place of his 'guru' Laxmanrao Inamdar. Modi was campaigning for the BJP ahead of the next week's Assembly polls and the by-election to Satara Lok Sabha seat, from where it has fielded Udayanraje Bhosale, who recently quit the NCP.

 Sharad Pawar targets PM Modi over 'doob maro' jibe: Why talk now about bringing back Article 370? | India News - Times of India,"NASHIK: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Thursday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""doob maro"" jibe directed at the opposition in connection with scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Addressing a poll rally in Niphad here in north Maharashtra, Pawar asked Modi why was he daring the opposition leaders to bring back Article 370 of the Constitution after it was nullified by Parliament in August. Pawar also hit out at Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for saying that public sector banks had the ""worst phase"" under the combination of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan. The Maratha strongman was a senior member of the Manmohan Singh-led cabinet. Modi had on Wednesday slammed the opposition leaders, seeking a link between the scrapping of Article 370 and the Maharashtra assembly polls, and told them to ""go drown"" (doob maro) for criticising the nullification of the controversial provision that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. ""How can they (Opposition) say that Jammu and Kashmir has nothing to do with Maharashtra? They should be ashamed of such thoughts. Don't they have any shame? Doob maro,"" the PM had said, using the two-word phrase in Hindi. Referring to the comment, Pawar said, ""Parliament abrogated Article 370. Modi sahib took the initiative. We do not oppose that. Some people kept forth their views on the issue, but they were labelled by some as anti-national. They become anti-nationals?"" ""The Prime Minister yesterday said doob maro. He dares us to bring Article 370 back. It was decided to scrap Article 370, Parliament scrapped it and now why are you now talking about bringing it back?"" he questioned. The former Union minister further said that there were several issues concerning the people, yet BJP leaders were consistently talking about defanging of Article 370. The only answer BJP leaders had for any of the people's issue was Article 370, Pawar quipped. On Sitharaman's remark, Pawar said, ""Are these people not aware of the tradition of this country? We never criticise the Prime Minister when abroad. They should also be mindful of this tradition."" Sitharaman had made the remarks while delivering a lecture at the Columbia University in the US. Pawar targeted the BJP-led government in Maharashtra over farmer suicides and job losses in the state, saying it did not pay attention towards these key issues. Maharashtra, which has a 288-member assembly, will vote on October 21 and results will be announced on October 24. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 EVM now means every vote for Manohar: Haryana CM | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Oct 17, 2019)Rohtak | Jhajjar | Palwal: Pradesh ka imaandaar mukhyamantri, naam Manohar kaam manohar (state’s honest chief minister, whose name is Manohar and work is charming) – such slogans are now customary at Haryana CM Manohar Lal’s rallies, which he addresses at the rate of more than half a dozen a day as he is seeking a second term. Such slogans reverberated at all three of Lal’s rallies that ET attended on Wednesday – in Meham in Rohtak, Badli in Jhajjar and Hathin in Palwal. At Palwal, where he completed 55 rallies this month, the CM introduced a new slogan. “People have started to say EVM means ‘every vote for Modi’. But some say Modi ji's election is now done. So I tell them you can change your slogan – EVM meaning ‘every vote for Manohar’. Is that OK?” Lal asked a boisterous crowd at Hathin. Speaking to ET on the sidelines of the Meham rally, Lal exuded confidence that the BJP would comfortably cross the 75 mark in the 90-seat assembly. “I have 24 more rallies to go this week. The public decided its mind six months ago,” he said. Meham, which neighbours former CM and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s home constituency, Garhi Sampla-Kiloi, is significant for Lal since he was born in a village falling under this seat but the BJP has never won in this Congress stronghold. “Haryana’s 2.5 crore people are not my janta (public) but my parivar (family). This seat is special for me as I was born in a village here 65 years ago. I fight from Karnal but I want my party to win this seat,” Lal told the crowd. Local BJP leaders, who have known Lal for long, said he has come a long way from serving the BJP in Haryana since 1996, in roles such as the state organisation general secretary. “Now he is looking to establish himself as a secondterm chief minister. This is the most crucial election for him,” said a local leader. At Palwal, Lal seemed most enthused about the crowd he got at his earlier rally in Muslim-dominated Nuh for the party's much-talked about candidate, Nauksham Chaudhary. Scrapping of Article 370, the “anaap-shanaap (nonsense)” Congress manifesto and a comparison of his five-year rule to “48 years of misrule” earlier comprised key themes of Lal’s speeches. Lashing out at the Congress for promising doles worth Rs 1.26 lakh crore in its manifesto, Lal said at his Palwal rally that the Congress cannot arrange funds of this order even in “chaar janam (four lives)”. “Terrorism in J&K will be finished after Article 370 has been scrapped,” Lal said in Meham. “This is being spoken about in every household of Haryana as we have a soldier in every house. But Congress does not want us to talk about this..” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Narendra Modi: History will take note of those who mocked Article 370 removal | India News - Times of India,"BEED: In a blistering attack on the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said history will have a mention of those who ridiculed the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and that Maharashtra now has an opportunity to punish them. He also expressed confidence that the BJP-led alliance will break all victory records in the October 21 state polls. Addressing an election rally at Parli in Maharashtra's Beed district, he said the state polls are a battle between BJP's ""karyashakti"" (power of development) and opposition's ""swarthshakti"" (selfishness). ""I trust you and your patriotism that you will teach a resounding lesson to those who speak against interests of the country. History will take note of every person who ridiculed the abrogation of Article 370,"" Modi said, alleging that the Congress leaders provided ""oxygen"" to anti-India elements. He said some Congress leaders said if Kashmir had Hindu population, this decision would not have been taken. ""When it comes to national integrity...you think of Hindu and Muslim. Does this suit you?"" he asked. Continuing his tirade against the opposition party, he said, ""Some Congress leaders said Article 370 abrogation is like murdering someone, India-Pakistan issue is not internal matter, abrogating Article 370 will lead to disaster in the country, Kashmir has been lost...the list is so long that I will have to stay here till October 21 to spell it out."" Modi said the country is looking at an opportunity to punish the Congress. ""The opportunity is knocking at Maharashtra's doors. I have trust in your patriotism that you will teach a lesson those who speak against the national interest,"" he said. He also said that the process of jailing those who ""looted"" public money has begun. Noting that ""lotus"" (BJP's poll symbol) has always bloomed in Beed district, Modi said the next week's poll results will ""break all victory records"". ""The Congress and NCP leaders must be gasping for breath seeing the huge response to BJP's rallies,"" he said. Modi said Beed gave him friends like late BJP leaders Gopinath Munde and Pramod Mahajan. ""These two are no longer around. But, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Pankaja Munde (minister and daughter of Gopinath Munde) are working to fulfil their dreams,"" he said. The BJP cadre is hard-working and winning hearts of the people, he said. ""While the Congress and NCP are fighting against each other, which is why many young leaders are quitting these parties, and the seniors are tired and dejected. Now the seniors are openly saying they are tired,"" he said. ""Can tired people serve you? What is the need of such people? This poll is a battle of BJP's 'karyashakti' versus 'swarthshakti' of the Congress and NCP,"" he said. Notably, senior Congress leader Sushilkumar Shinde last week said his party and the NCP have become ""tired"". Modi also highlighted the 'Jalyukt Shivar' water conservation scheme and the proposed Marathwada water grid, to provide relief to people the perennially parched region, as achievements of the Fadnavis-led state government. He also that said Rs 2,000 crore was already deposited in farmers' accounts (as part of welfare scheme).

 Jat belt’s call remains a key factor in Haryana election | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Oct 17, 2019)Sirsa| Hisar| Rohtak |Jhajjar: The key Jat belt –– comprising 36 assembly seats extending across four parliamentary constituencies –– holds the key to Haryana elections. But which way will Jats vote? Will they remain loyal to the Congress, OP Chautala’s INLD and the newly-formed Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) or switch sides to the BJP, which rode to power in 2014 by tapping into the non-Jat support base? ET travelled through this belt to assess the ground reality. WINDS OF CHANGE?Haryana’s political families of Devi Lal, Bansi Lal, Bhajan Lal and Hoodas have ruled the Jat belt from Rohtak through Hisar to Sirsa. Even as Devi Lal’s INLD has split, the core Jat votebase has stayed with INLD or JJP. The shift to BJP has not happened in the political families’ strongholds. In Barapurra of Sirsa district, the support for INLD is evident. Surender Singh of Barapurra says, “It has always been INLD for our village. If we got jobs, it was during the time of Om Prakash Chautalaji. BJP has done nothing for us.” livebudget updatesmoreupdatesIn Chhattariyan, women swear by the Chautalas. “We are a Jat-dominated village. We have always voted for Chautala ji. Even if there is JJP, our vote will go to him,” says a villager Promilla. Voters in Adampur remain loyal to Congress’ Kuldeep Bishnoi. Roop Chand of Bagla village says, “We don’t care which party he (Bishnoi) is in. He has worked for our constituency. Nobody can take his place.” Pitted against TikTok star Sonali Phogat, Bishnoi is going strong. Villagers are unfazed by corruption charges and raids on their MLA. Rishan, a tea shop owner, says, “Corruption is found in any business. Will Sonali Phogat have the time to spend in Adampur?” Prahlad Singh of Ghudsal of Adampur counts the works. “They weren’t in power, but see how Bishnoi worked for roads, water, irrigation and jobs in Adampur,” he says. What seems to have cemented this mistrust for BJP is the February 2016 Jat reservation agitation. In Narnaund, home constituency of BJP Jat leader and Haryana’s finance minister Captain Abhimanyu, the angst is evident. “He has done nothing,” says villager Satender Singh adding, “Let him come to our village Petwad. He will know. The real fight is between INLD and JJP.” In Narnaund, people count lack of jobs as the biggest reason for anti-incumbency. LOCAL ELECTIONBJP is banking on its governance track record under chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and the popularity of PM Narendra Modi. Though party seniors are playing the nationalism card, and even counting Article 370 as its achievement, there is no reverberation of the issue here. Karamvir Singh of Narnaund says, “I am sitting idle at home. I have no job. Do you think I even care about Article 370? We can buy land there (J&K) –– what does that mean? I can’t buy land in Rajasthan when it is so cheap. It seems like a joke.” TACTICAL APPROACHBJP had been a non-entity in Haryana till the 2014 assembly elections. Actively wooing the Punjabi votebank, BJP came to power on its own. This time, it has given a call of “Ab ki baar pichhattar paar”. Delivering on this call means it would need to win a considerable number of 36 seats, which have remained elusive so far. BJP’s strategy is to wean strong Jat leaders from other parties and give them tickets in seats it hasn’t won in three elections. What could work for the BJP is the split between JJP and INLD. If Jat votes split between the two parties the result would be obvious – Advantage BJP. BJP has wooed leaders in Sirsa, Hisar, Rohtak and Bhiwani-Mahendragarh districts. How much would be the turn depends on factors like triangular fights and effectively managing rebels. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Maharashtra elections: BJP’s tactics like Article 370 will not work out in polls | Nashik News - Times of India,"NASHIK: R C Khuntia, the in-charge of the AICC in north Maharashtra, on Wednesday said that BJP’s tactics such as raising the Article 370 abrogation issue will not work in the state assembly elections. He was critical of the NDA government in the state for its alleged failure in tackling various issues including unemployment, lack of investment, poor condition of roads and farmers’ problems. Khuntia exuded confidence that Congress will win at least 12 of the 17 seats in five districts — Nashik, Dhule, Jalgoan, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar. Speaking to TOI, Khuntia said, “Last time, Congress had won nine seats. However, this time we will win 12 seats in five districts of North Maharashtra. Moreover, UPA will win seats required to form the government.” Khuntia accredited development in various including road transport, education, poverty eradication programme, NRGP, industries and others to Congress. “BJP-Sena combine has completely failed to fulfil its election manifesto regarding farmers’ issues, creating job opportunities, providing drinking water, irrigation water, etc. Hence, we appeal to the people of Maharashtra to support Congress and give us an opportunity to form the government,” he said. He also took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for raising national issues like Article 370 during BJP’s campaign and said that these issues have nothing to do with the state assembly elections as the issues of the state are completely different. “PM Modi and other BJP leaders are raising these issues to hide the BJP government’s failure to bring investment, creat job opportunities and address the issues of farmers in the state,” he said. When asked about former leaders of Congress like Amrishbhai Patel, who quit the party to join BJP, Khuntia said that these leaders enjoyed their position when Congress was in power in the state and the Centre. “The party will not be affected even though such leaders quit the party. In fact, Congress was defeated in last state and Lok Sabha elections because of these leaders. But now, young generation is getting attracted to the leadership of Congress. The party will definitely do well during the upcoming elections,” he said. “Congress was voted to power in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan in Lok Sabha elections. This time too, Congress-NCP alliance will be voted to power in Maharashtra during assembly elections,” he added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"‘If BJP so confident, why’s PM campaigning here?’ | Gurgaon News - Times of India","SOHNA: Dismissing BJP’s claims that it would win more than 75 seats in the Haryana assembly elections, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday said had the party been so sure of a majority, it would not have brought in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah to campaign. “They can bring the PM 10 more times and have Amit Shah campaign in every alley in the city, but the people of Haryana have decided to show them the door this time,” Dushyant said while addressing the public in support of JJP candidate for Sohna constituency, Rohtash Khatana. Around 10,000 people, consisting of a large number of youth, gathered to listen to the Jat leader. And despite arriving nearly four hours late, Dushyant was welcomed with chants of ‘JJP zindabad’ and ‘Devi Lal amar rahe’. Attacking the ruling party on law and order as well as women’s safety, the JJP leader said that the state witnesses a murder every day and three rapes are reported on an average. “Just two days ago, a three-year-old cut was raped and then her hands and legs were cut. This is the condition of women in the state,” said Dushyant. He rejected Khattar’s claims of a transparent and honest government, saying multiple scams had taken place under his rule. On BJP consistently raising the issue of the abrogation of Article 370 to woo voters in a state that sends a significant number of people to the armed forces, Dushyant said Haryana and its people do not need outsiders to come and teach them patriotism. If elected, Dushyant told the gathering, JJP will ensure development in Sohna, 75% reservation in private jobs to local youth, Rs 5,100 pension for the elderly and free education for girls up to the level of PhD, among other things. Addressing the rally, Khatana said, “Both BJP and Congress have fielded outsiders from Sohna and my candidature is solely to defeat these people. Once elected, I will work for the development of the region along with the members of 36 communities.” Khatana fought the previous two polls from Sohna but lost. This time, he is the only local candidate and is up against BJP’s Sanjay Singh and Congress’ Dr Shamsuddin. Meanwhile, Dushyant on Wednesday moved the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking security cover claiming threat to his life. Claiming to have received a call from a person in Dubai, Dushyant submitted that he was threatened not to campaign vigorously in the state assembly elections, else he would face dire consequences.

""How can they (Opposition) say that Jammu and Kashmir has nothing to do with Maharashtra? They should be ashamed of such thoughts. Don't they have any shame?

Modi said Hindutva ideologue V D Savarkar's ""sanskar"" (values) are the basis for nation-building, and rued that Babasaheb Ambedkar was denied the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. ""It is due to Savarkar's 'sanskar' that we put nationalism as the basis for nation-building,"" Modi said. His remarks came a day after BJP's Maharashtra unit sought Bharat Ratna for Savarkar in its poll manifesto.

Addressing a poll rally at Tigaon near Faridabad, Shah said it was only the Narendra Modi government which abrogated the special status for Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, making the region an integral part of the country. The BJP president said several prime ministers before Modi did not dare to take a decision on nullification of Article 370.

Maharashtra BJP manifesto 2019: BJP Maharashtra manifesto vows Bharat Ratna for Savarkar | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: BJP released its manifesto for the Maharashtra assembly elections on Tuesday, promising to propose the names of Veer Savarkar, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule and Annabhau Sathe for the Bharat Ratna. The party also said it would create one crore jobs in the state over the next five years and spend Rs 5 lakh crore on infrastructure. The manifesto, which was unveiled by working president JP Nadda, also said all proposed memorials would be completed. A memorial for Atal Bihari Vajpayee would also be built. The Savarkar announcement triggered sharp reactions from the opposition, which accused the saffron party of showing its ""true colours"" of hardline Hindutva. For BJP, the focus on Savarkar sits well with the assertion by its national president Amit Shah that nationalism and defanging of Article 370 were relevant in the state election. While Hindu nationalists hail Savarkar as a freedom fighter, Congress - Rahul Gandhi in particular - has accused him of kowtowing to the British. BJP looks up to Savarkar as a national icon, as does the Sangh Parivar, as he formulated the theory of Hindutva in the early 1920s. Savarkar was never a part of RSS but was president of the Hindu Mahasabha for five years starting 1937. The promise comes at a time when BJP ally Shiv Sena has been pushing for a Bharat Ratna for Savarkar. The move is seen by a section of political observers as part of BJP's attempt to take an emotive issue away from its now-junior ally in the state. The inclusion of social reformers Sathe and the Phules, all of whom fought for elimination of the caste system, in the Bharat Ratna wishlist is expected to round off the BJP proposal with an inclusive touch. The manifesto also said one crore families would be connected to self-help groups and internet connectivity would be provided across the state. ""The manifesto has been prepared keeping future needs and challenges in mind,"" Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said. Housing for all by 2022, the flagship scheme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be accomplished along with drinking water connectivity and basic civic infrastructure, said the manifesto. The state government along with the Centre will spend Rs 5 lakh crore on infrastructure, besides a separate fund for road infrastructure, said the manifesto. Fadnavis said that given the fact that road construction agencies were overburdened, a separate agency would be set up to carry out maintenance of roads.

 Article 370 blocked northeast success stories from being replicated in J&amp;K: Jitendra Singh | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Union minister Jitendra Singh on Tuesday said Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, had blocked the success stories of the northeast from being replicated in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Addressing the curtain raiser event, as chief guest, on the eve of ""North East Expo 2019"" here, Singh said the revolutionary transformation that the northeastern states have undergone over the last five years of the Modi government, is of such an ""unimaginable magnitude"" that it is to be seen to be believed. The Union minister for the development of the northeastern region (DoNER) said his only regret sometimes is that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been extraordinarily indulgent and patronising to uplift the peripheral regions of India, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh could not receive the same benefits as Northeast, simply because of the vested embargoes imposed in the name of Article 370. The central government on August 5 announced the abrogation of Article 370 and creation of two Union territories — Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Singh said, for example, while a small northeastern state like Mizoram with a population of mere 10 lakh has in the last two years set up Indian subcontinent's first-of-its-kind specialised ""Citrus Food Park"" with Israel's collaboration which has been hailed as a ""Centre of Excellence"", Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, despite their abundant food and horticulture resources, could not achieve a single such achievement.

On campaign trail in Vidarbha for October 21 Maharashtra assembly elections, he also targeted the Modi government for ""waiving"" corporate tax. Addressing a rally in Yavatmal district, Gandhi said the prime minister speaks of the moon mission and abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, but is silent on issues such as farmers' plight and lack of jobs. ""The Goods and Services Tax (GST) and demonetisation broke the back of small and medium enterprises, farmers, labourers and poor people. As long as the Modi government is in power, the issue of joblessness will continue to haunt the country. The problem of joblessness will grow in the next six months,"" he claimed. Criticising the government's decision to ""waive"" (slash the rates of) corporate tax, Gandhi said such benefits were extended to certain industrialists, but not to the poor. The Congress leader also alleged that the Union government was planning to privatise national assets such as ports, coal mines, and public sector units such as Air India. ""Modi is the loudspeaker of (industrialists) Adani and Ambani. Just like a pickpocket, who diverts attention of people before stealing, his (Modi's) only job is to divert your attention so that he can pass your money to a select few industrialists,"" Gandhi said. While the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), Right to Food, land acquisition and laws for tribals were being amended, amendment to the GST act was not acceptable to the government, he said. ""When the poor person gets money, he starts purchasing, when the demand increases, manufacturing gets a boost,"" he said, adding that the NYAY minimum income scheme, proposed by the Congress before the Lok Sabha elections, would have jump-started the economy. The annual budget of MNREGA is Rs 35,000 crore and the Modi government cut corporate tax worth Rs 1.25 lakh crore in a single day, Gandhi said. Referring to defence minister Rajnath Singh's France visit, he said the latter did a puja of the Rafale fighter jet (while taking symbolic delivery of the first aircraft). ""But Rs 35,000 crore were stolen from the jet deal. The media will not write about this because it is being controlled by industrialists. Your money is given to the media so that they publicise Modi,"" he alleged. Maharashtra has the opportunity to solve all these problems by voting for the Congress and NCP, he said. ""We will install a government which will work for the poor, farmers, labourers, and small and medium businesses,"" he added. At a rally at Arvi in Wardha district, Gandhi accused the Modi government of weakening all pro-poor schemes of the UPA regime, including the MNREGA, RTI Act, Right to Food and the land acquisition bill. ""BJP made fun of MNREGA which had given a boost to the economy,"" he said. The GST's purpose was to finish off small and medium businesses, the Congress leader claimed. ""Don't let this happen in Maharashtra. Let's stop this here,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" Haryana elections: BJP faces a battle in Jat, Muslim belts | India News - Times of India","(This story originally appeared in  on Oct 15, 2019)NEW DELHI: BJP is tipped to win the Assembly elections in Haryana but the ride to power is not without hurdles. The party is facing a tough battles in Jat-dominated central Haryana, Muslim-dominated southern part of the statea and areas adjoining Delhi. Some BJP leaders who have been denied a ticket are also creating roadblocks. BJP sources said the party brass does not want the cadre to get complacent and all efforts are afoot to fight with all its might. BJP chief Amit Shah and working president JP Nadda are holding rallies across the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to hold four rallies, the first of which was organised on Monday at Ballabhgarh, Faridabad. Modi will address two rallies on Tuesday- in Kurukshetra and Charkhi Dadri. Aware that the development plank is not a selling point in elections where caste and some anti-incumbency in the last five years are at play, BJP is raking up the nationalism issue to win votes with abrogation of Article 370 being a major issue. BJP’s assessment is that it is facing a challenge in the Rohtak-Sonipat region and may lose some seats to Congress. Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and BJP general secretary in-charge of the state Anil Jain are camping in this area to improve the party’s prospects. BJP candidate Meena Narwal is on a weak wicket in Kharkhauda reserved seat in Sonepat. After losing in the Lok Sabha elections, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda is giving the party a tough fight in other seats of this region as well. In Hisar, though ex-Congress state unit chief Ashok Tanwar quitting the party will help BJP, the road is tough due to Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) and INLD. Kuldeep Bishnoi (Congress) is also a strong candidate against Tik-Tok star and BJP nominee Sonali Phogat. Though BJP has fielded wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt in Baroda (Jind), sources said it is not an easy battle and the party will have to make a strong effort to pull through. The party is also facing some rebellion in Faridabad and Gurugram where those who were denied a ticket are covertly opposing the BJP candidates. BJP is faced with the same problem in Rewari and a few other neighbouring constituencies. BJP has always been weak in Mewat, the region located in south Haryana. A sizable Meo Muslim population here has either backed Congress or INLD in the past. BJP has little hope in Punahana seat in Nuh district where Nauksham Chaudhary is the candidate. It has pinned all its hopes on Zakir Hussain and Naseem Ahmed in Nuh and Ferozepur Jhirka seats, respectively. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 District-wise plans in works to push central schemes in J&amp;K | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Oct 15, 2019)NEW DELHI: The Centre is preparing a plan to ensure 100% coverage of its direct benefit schemes for students and youngsters in Jammu & Kashmir after a review showed the schemes had failed to meet targets. A series of inter-ministerial meetings chaired by the home secretary in New Delhi last month also decided to draw up district-wise ratings to assess the exact spread, reach and delivery of individual beneficiary centric schemes. The meetings assessed individual benefit schemes run by the human resource development ministry, skill development ministry, tribal affairs ministry and the ministry of minority affairs. The HRD ministry’s centrally sponsored scholarship scheme for colleges and universities was expected to reach 1,285 students by March 2020, but only 81 students have benefitted so far and not a single student has availed of the special scholarship scheme meant for 983 students in J&K. The interest subsidy scheme target was 11,079 beneficiaries but only 3,563 have availed of it. The national merit-cum-means scholarship for school goers has reached only 235 children. The tribal affairs ministry reported that no one sought pre-matric and post-matric scholarships in J&K. The minority affairs ministry’s scheme for formal school education and skilling of school dropouts had about 7,000 beneficiaries from J&K against a countrywide target of one lakh. The ministry, however, has met targets and exceeded them in certain schemes. Against expected 1.14 lakh beneficiaries of its pre-matric scholarships, there were 1.72 lakh beneficiaries in J&K in 2018-19. Similarly, over 56,000 students benefited from post-matric scheme against the 19,142 projected beneficiaries. The Maulana Azad National fellowship covered 178 students against a projection of 38 beneficiaries. The ministries have now been asked to outline the percentage of people covered through schemes vis-à-vis the total population and help draw up a district-wise ratings. The reach of similar schemes in other states will also be assessed and compared with implementation in J&K. It also emerged at the meeting that certain schemes were demand driven and there can be progress only when there are sufficient applicants from the state. Special efforts, therefore, need to be made to reach out to potential applicants. The meetings also took on board proposals the J&K administration had made. The union territory has sought funds to set up 50 new colleges, 500 new higher secondary schools, 100 libraries, hostels for students from scheduled tribes, a Rs 200-crore skill development programme — proposals which are under discussion at the Centre.

 Abrogating Article 370 a decisive step for peace in Kashmir: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Stating that the Narendra Modi government had taken a decisive step towards uprooting terrorism by abrogating Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday exuded confidence that lasting peace would be established in the Valley. “India has for long suffered from Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. I doubt if there is any other country that has waged such a protracted fight against terror. Recently, the government under PM Modi’s leadership took a big step towards uprooting terror by abrogating Article 370 in J&K and bringing security to the state. I am confident that we will be able to establish lasting peace in Kashmir,” Shah said in his address at NSG’s raising day function in Manesar near Gurugram. Reiterating that the Modi government was resolute in its policy of zero-tolerance against terrorism, Shah said the NSG‘s proven counter-terror capabilities, both in terms of commando skills and equipment, were enough assurance that the country was secure against terror threats. “NSG commandos and the various commando units of the states trained by NSG together form an impregnable barrier against terror strikes and give us confidence that the country can progress on the path of development and peace,” Shah said after an impressive display of NSG’s capabilities at the Manesar grounds. Recalling that NSG has since 2014 been empowered in terms of mobility surveillance, firepower and counter-drone capabilities, adding to its skills in counter-terrorism, anti-hijacking operations, securing international and national events and bomb disposal, Shah said he could now confidently say that the country is secure against terror threats. “Of course, it is not the equipment of the force but the valour, motivation and patriotism of its men — all of which are the trademark of NSG commandos — that assure it of victory...I know that NSG is fully prepared to fight terror 24x7 and hence we are reassured about the country’s internal security,” he said.

Harking back to an issue that Congress had turned into one of its major campaigning points against the government in the Lok Sabha elections held earlier this year — the Rafale fighter jets deal between India and France — Modi said BJP had remained committed to modernisation of the armed forces despite Congress’ “conspiracy” to cancel the Rafale deal. “There was a conspiracy to ensure that we do not get a modern fighter jet. But despite this, India got Rafale,” said PM. He also blamed Congress for the delay in development of the indigenously built light combat aircraft Tejas, which got operational clearance for induction into the air force this year. “I don’t know what kind of pressure they were under to delay it. We gave wings to Tejas and now it is a proud member of our forces,” said Modi. “I will not allow our jawan to fight without ammunition and modern equipment.

"Haryana polls: Water, not Article 370, an issue in Haryana’s soldier factory | Gurgaon News - Times of India","CHANDENI (CHARKHI DADRI): The BJP government in Haryana is largely banking on changes in the Article 370 and nationalism to return to power in the state, which is a hub of the armed forces. However, the areas with high proportion of ‘fauji families’ instead want focus on developmental issues. TOI visited Charkhi-Dadri’s Chandeni, a village with illustrious history of sending more soldiers to armed forces than apparently any other in the state, and found it struggling for basics of life like water. The villagers are forced to buy water from private persons, who have laid own pipelines connecting the storage tanks to their borewells. This water is available on payment of Rs 350 per month but is not potable. Meanwhile, the groundwater table has dropped to 600 feet and what is drawn can only be used for washing clothes and livestock. As it is semi-arid area, borewells provided by the government to supply water are not sufficient to cater to the requirement of the village. The government school has no faculty for science stream. Although the general mode of communication is mobile, many departments communicate via post. The village has no post office because of which sometimes important mails are delayed. “Unfortunately, the government has permitted opening of a liquor vend at the entry of village rather than declaring it an adarsh (ideal) village for being the fertile ground for recruitment into armed forces,” says Pawan Sangwan who runs a private school on the outskirts of the village. He added that there cannot be any better achievement and contribution than to declare Chandeni an adarsh (model) village. To put it in perspective, there are 600 houses in the village, a population is around 3,000 with around 2,300 voters and almost every single family has serving or retired soldiers. Around 600 soldiers from the village are serving in the armed forces, around 300 are pensioners and an equal number of widows of soldiers are getting family pension. “Abrogation of Article 370 is a political decision but the soldiers of the country continue to serve in accordance with the orders received from seniors. Use of such issues in elections is not going to have much impact. Soldiers work on borders and would be happy if the basic facilities to their families are provided,” said Subedar Dharam Chand, 93, one of the oldest pensioners in the village. Another veteran, Havildar Tribhuvan Singh said the government should focus on providing water to them. “The water has gone down to 600 feet. Villagers are forced to purchase water through private pipelines but that is also not consumable. A water tank constructed in our village around 15 years ago is yet to be connected to government supply lines,” he added. Explaining the reasons behind such high number of people joining the armed forces, local resident Hari Kishan said that all the villagers have a total of 840-acre land only, which is insufficient for 600 families living here. “Initially, they had no option expect to join armed forces but later it became a tradition,” he added. The village comes under Badhra assembly constituency from where former chief minister Bansi Lal’s son Ranbir Mahendra, Dushyant Chautala’s mother Naina Chautala and BJP MLA Sukhwinder Sheoran are in a fierce triangular contest. Why is Chandeni important? Located around 25 km from the newly-carved Charkhi-Dadri district, Chandeni village has the distinction of giving 29 commissioned officers to the armed forces. Interestingly, both grandson and granddaughter of former minister Satpal Sangwan, who is also a native of the village, have joined the Army recently. As many as 21 soldiers from this village have laid down their lives for the country in various wars and military operations. One of them, Havildar Dayanand was awarded Vir Chakra, country’s third highest wartime gallantry award in the 1971 war. On most of the village roads, streets and fields, memorials of martyrs can be seen. Five generations in Army At 93, Subedar Dharam Chand, who retired in January 1975 after around 28 years in Brigade of the Guards regiment, is the eldest pensioner of the village. He had participated 1948 J&K war, 1965, and 1971 Indo-Pak wars. In 1962 Chinese aggression, he was instructor at Dehradun. Interestingly, his five generations have served in the army. His grandfather Nihal Singh was in British Indian Army, his father Kharga Ram had served in Jat regiment and he himself retired as subedar from Brigade of the Guards regiment. His two sons also served in the same regiment, and his grandson Sanjeev Kumar has followed their footsteps. One of his grandsons works with BSF. British army had named a garden, located inside a training centre at Bareilly “Kharga Bagh” after his grandfather in recognition of his services as an efficient drill instructor. Like Dharam Chand’s family, there are many in the village whose several generations are in the Army. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

 Two terrorists kill Rajasthan apple truck driver in Shopian | India News - Times of India,"SHOPIAN: Two terrorists killed the driver of an apple truck at Sindhu Shirmal village in Shopian while he was loading the cargo from an orchard on Monday evening. ""It is learnt that the villagers tried to save the civilian. In turn, the terrorists thrashed them as well and committed the gruesome crime. As per the initial investigations, the terrorist groups of Jaish-e-Muhammed or Hizbul Mujahideen are behind this terror act,"" said SSP Shopian Sandeep Chaudhary. Incidentally, this comes on the first day of partial restoration of the communication network in the Valley since the clampdown imposed on August 5 after the defanging of Article 370 granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

"Narendra Modi says soldiers lost lives because of Cong's 'love' for Article 370, asserts country has backed his decision | India News - Times of India","BALLABGARH (HARYANA): Launching a broadside against the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked the opposition party to explain ""its love"" for Article 370 to the families of security personnel martyred in Jammu and Kashmir. Addressing his first of four election rallies in Haryana this week, he said the opposition was shedding ""crocodile tears"" and challenged the Congress to tell people that it will rescind the Modi government's decision on J-K if voted to power. Modi also targeted the Congress over Rafale, saying he was happy that despite its best efforts to stall the deal, the country had received first of the fighter jets, and stressed that the BJP was committed to strengthening security forces. After it swept the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP has again made nationalism its major poll plank in upcoming assembly elections, which will be the first in the country after the Centre's decision to scrap special status to J-K on August 5. Asserting that India is now taking big decisions like on Article 370 which were unthinkable earlier, the Prime Minister said the massive mandate from the people gave him the strength to take the step which, he asserted, has the backing of the entire country including Haryana. Some people whose interests have been affected are raising questions on this decision and seeking help in foreign nations, the Prime Minister said, while again targeting the opposition on the issue as he did in poll-bound Maharashtra on Sunday. Modi said the opposition parties in Haryana were crumbling and their attempts to come together are falling apart, while the BJP had a ""strong team and a strong captain"" in chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. ""India is taking big decisions, which no one could think of earlier. Which decision am I talking about? This decision on Article 370,"" he said. Modi said there was feeling in Haryana and the entire country that J&K needs to be pulled out of spiral of violence and put on path of development. ""J&K and Ladakh are moving on path of trust and development and credit for this does not go to Modi, but it goes to 130 crore people of this country and voters of this country. You gave us big mandate and I derive strength from you to realise your dreams,"" he said. Modi accused the opposition parties of politicising the issue of Article 370.""The entire country is also seeing people whose interests have been affected by the decision on Article 370 are in a state of shock. These people are raising questions on this decision and seeking help in foreign nations."" ""Those who are unable to sleep and 'j in ke pet mein chuhey daud rahe hain', if these people have so much liking for Article 370 and 35-A, then I challenge them why don't they muster courage and go before people of Haryana and tell them that if they win elections, they will bring back Article 370 and 35-A,"" Modi said. On Sunday, Khattar too had used a Hindi proverb "" khoda pahad nikli chuhiya"" to take a swipe at the Congress' three-month effort at choosing a president, drawing ire of the opposition party. The proverb suggests there was much ado about noting. Though literally, it means finding a mouse after digging a mountain. He said those opposing the decision know that Modi government got overwhelming public mandate and support because of which the Centre was able to take a decision on Article 370. He asked people to go to villages and make people understand the benefits of the step. Training guns on opposition, he said ""because of their love for Article 370 mothers lost their brave sons and young women were widowed"". ""The brave jawan of Haryana who was protecting innocent citizens of J&K, who fell to bullet of terrorists and when his body came back wrapped in tricolour, ask those mothers how many sons-of-soil lost lives because of your love for Article 370... ask how many were widowed and how many children were orphaned,"" he said at the rally in the state which sends a large numbers of youths in security forces. ""Those who lost their dear ones for peace in J&K, Congress leaders must tell them why they love Article 370 so much. They must tell in what way this Article benefited the state,"" he said Taking a dig at Congress, Modi said, it should ""tell people that it will reverse what Modi has done. And when Lok Sabha elections come, mention in manifesto that they will reverse these decisions. Do they have the courage to say so?"" He said the Dalit community in Jammu and Kashmir was deprived of decent jobs there. He said that wards of people belonging to 'Valmiki' community were never considered capable of other jobs than sweeping and toilet cleaning for four generations. Modi also accused the Congress of doing votebank politics over triple talaq issue, alleging the opposition parties made every kind of excuse to stall the law against triple talaq. ""Congress and other parties like them stood like a wall in the way of each betterment and change you have seen,"" Modi alleged. A day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi again rake up the Rafale deal issue, the Prime Minister alleged that the opposition made their best efforts to ensure the agreement for fighter jets was cancelled. You remember, during Lok Sabha polls, how they made a hue and cry over the Rafale deal. They were beating their chests and made their best efforts to ensure that the agreement for Rafale was cancelled, he said. Modi said that he was happy that India had got its first Rafale aircraft. He said that it was not acceptable to him that country's soldiers become victims of the enemy in the absence of necessary arms and ammunition. Modi accused the previous Congress government of putting Tejas project, the home-built jet, on the back burner. ""Don't know (it was done) under whose pressure. Our government has removed all the bottlenecks and gave wings to this project,"" he said. He said undertaking development and bringing change in people's lives has always been his priority. Modi praised Khattar, saying his team has taken Haryana to new heights of development. He said the more the opposition parties are trying to come together, the more they are falling apart. Modi began his address by saying the place is not far from here where during Emergency days former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was arrested and put behind bars for 19 months. Seeking to strike an emotional chord, he said, ""When I am amongst you, when I come to Haryana, I always feel like I am coming to my home. Haryana taught me a lot...""

He also said that telephone lines were being used by terrorists for mobilisation and carrying out attacks. ""People used to make noise that there is no telephone. We stopped telephone services because terrorists were using them for their activities, mobilisation and indoctrination. For us, the life of every Kashmiri was important and not telephone.

 Scrapping of Article 370 is final nail in terrorism coffin: UP CM Yogi Adityanath | India News - Times of India,"PUNE: Campaigning for the BJP for the October 21 Maharashtra assembly elections, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for removing special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, a move he described as the ""final nail in the coffin of terrorism"". Addressing a public rally in Lonavla in Pune district in support of BJP candidate Sanjay Bhegde, Adityanath said that by nullifying Article 370 Modi turned the idea of ""One nation, great nation"" into reality. ""Kashmir, which is called as paradise on the Earth, turned into hell under Article 370. Terrorists used to kill innocent civilians and Indian soldiers,"" he said, adding that the withdrawn provision was a major impediment in development of Jammu and Kashmir. The chief minister also said that it was Syama Prasad Mukherjee, the founder of the BJP's forerunner Jana Sangha, who had staunchly opposed the idea of ""two prime ministers, two signs, and two Constitutions"" under Article 370. ""The idea of 'one nation, great nation' became a reality thanks to Narendra Modiji and (Union home minister) Amit Shah. With this decision, the final nail was put in the coffin of terrorism. The move has sent the message that terrorism has no place on the Indian soil,"" he said. Adityanath also praised Modi government for working for the cause of the empowerment of women, which he said was previously restricted only to ""slogans"". He listed schemes like ' Beti Bachav, Beti Padhao', ' Ujjwala Yojana', and the law to criminalise triple talaq to make his point. He said his Maharashtra counterpart Devendra Fadnavis, who is seeking a second term, has ""transformed"" the lives of people by implementing several welfare projects. ""Gone are the days when thousands of farmers used to commit suicide. The Fadnavis government has not only stopped suicides by launching pro-farmer schemes, but also generated employment opportunities for people,"" he added. Adityanath said Fadnavis government broke the back of crime in the state. ""There was time when goons of the 'D' (Dawood Ibrahim) gang used to extort money; bomb blasts occurred, but in the last five years all these elements have disappeared and a secure atmosphere prevailed in Maharashtra,"" he said. The assembly polls are scheduled to be held on October 21. Counting of votes will take place on October 24. Nullification of Article 370 has become a focal point of the BJP's electoral discourse, drawing allegations from the Opposition camp that the saffron top brass is skirting core issues like ""economic downturn"" to ""divert"" attention of voters.

" British-Indian organizations write to Jeremy Corbyn, slam Labour Party's Kashmir resolution | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Over 100 British-Indian organisations, representing diverse communities across the UK, wrote to the leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn on Monday condemning its ""ill-conceived and partisan"" Kashmir resolution in wake of the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K. The UK's Opposition Labour Party had on September 25 passed an emergency motion on Kashmir calling for party leader Jeremy Corbyn to seek international observers to ""enter"" the region and demand the right of self-determination for its people, drawing criticism from the Indian diaspora. In the letter addressed to Corbyn, the British-Indian organisations expressed dismay that the party had abandoned a long-standing cross-party position on Kashmir as a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.

""We are also highly concerned about the wider attempts to bring the Kashmir issue into the domestic politics of the United Kingdom, which has serious ramifications for the community harmony. ""At a time when Brexit has already created deep divisions within our country, the last thing we need is to further divide different communities within the UK whilst destroying our diplomatic relations with the world's largest democracy and long standing, valued strategic partner,"" the letter said. The letter further said, ""We are particularly dismayed by the virulent reaction by the Labour Party to the removal of an outdated, temporary provision that was hindering development of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, development for people of all religions, of all genders, of all ethnicities. Progress, human rights, and values which we would have expected the Labour Party to stand for. ""For the avoidance of doubt, our organisations do not take party political positions and include members of all parties and none. However, in this instance, we feel compelled to highlight this serious issue. We are consulting with members and community colleagues to reconsider the level and nature of engagement with Labour Party representatives going forward in the light of the strident position your party and you have taken,"" it added. In contrast with the British government's official stand of Kashmir being a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan, the Opposition resolution tabled at Labour's annual party conference in Brighton called for intervention by Corbyn to ensure someone from the party is represented to attend the United Nations Human Rights Council on the issue.

Amit Shah continues attack on Pawar for opposing Article 370 abrogation | Kolhapur News - Times of India,"KOLHAPUR: BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday continued his attack on NCP chief Sharad Pawar for questioning the government’s decision to scrap Article 370. Addressing an election rally here, Shah said Pawar has been questioning the relevance of abrogating Article 370 because he does not understand the “pain of the families of 40,000 people who lost their lives in Kashmir due to terroristic activities over the years”. At a rally in Sangli a few days back, Shah had similarly targeted Pawar and Rahul Gandhi, asking them to clarify whether they were for or against scrapping Article 370. “Kashmir was disconnected from India, and Pakistan resorted to terrorist activities because of Article 370. Abrogating Article 370 has made Kashmir an integral part of India in the true sense. It is the biggest achievement of the Modi government,” Shah said. Shah also claimed that the Congress had no national security policy. “Rahul Gandhi opposed the abrogation of Article 370. Manmohan Singh never uttered a single word when Indian jawans were beheaded by terrorists. It was only because of Modi’s decision that the Indian Army opted for a surgical strike,” he said. “Maharashtra and Haryana are the first states to go for assembly elections immediately after the scrapping of Article 370. Voters should seek a clarification from the Congress and NCP on their opposition to its removal,” the BJP president said at the rally to campaign for Amal Mahadik, the BJP nominee from Kolhapur South, and other candidates of BJP-Shiv Sena alliance. The BJP president also came down heavily on the Congress for opposing the triple talaq law. Shah, who attended another meeting in Karad to campaign for BJP LS bypoll candidate Udayanraje Bhosale, again criticised Pawar for saying that the BJP-Sena had stopped the work on water projects in the Krishna valley due to corruption. He challenged Pawar to prove at least one corruption case against chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “He (Fadnavis) is honest and you can’t even level a single allegation against him,” Shah said. Shah raised the issue of alleged corruption in the irrigation schemes during the previous Democratic Front regime. “Irrigation scam of Rs 70,000 crore took place when Congress and NCP were in power, but the Fadnavis government spent just Rs 9,000 crore and provided water to 18,000 villages under the Jalyukta Shivar scheme,” he said. Shah also lashed out at former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan. “Chavan was working in Dehi for so many years, but Karad continued to be deprived of development,” he said, adding that the Congress-NCP claims to have spent Rs 70,000 crore on irrigation schemes but farmers did not get water. “Where has the money gone?” he asked. “The Fadnavis government started all those works in the Krishna valley that had been closed for 15 years. Modi government has provided Rs 15 lakh crore for 34 water projects in the Krishna valley and we will complete them,” he said, adding that the Fadnavis government had brought 48,000 hectares under irrigation in the past five years.

"Bring back Article 370 provisions in manifesto, PM Modi dares position | Nashik News - Times of India","JALGAON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday dared the opposition parties to declare in their manifestoes that they will roll back the abrogation of Article 370 and scrap the triple talaq law. Addressing his maiden poll rally in Jalgaon in north Maharashtra, Modi described Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as the “crown” of the country and challenged the opposition parties to make a promise in their manifestos for the upcoming assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, as well as for all future polls, that they would “bring back” Article 370. “This year, on August 5, our government had taken an extraordinary decision — to abrogate Article 370. Our opposition could not even think of this when they were in power. They are now unable to digest our decision. As a result, they have been making remarks on the issue that are only delighting our neighbour (Pakistan),” he said. “I am throwing an open challenge to the opposition — to make a promise in their manifestos in the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly polls and in all future polls in the country that they would roll back the Article 370 abrogation if they come to power. But they will not do so, as they know that the people of the country have hailed our decision and will not spare anyone who tries to bring back Article 370. The opposition must stop shedding crocodile tears on this matter,” he said. Modi said that under Article 370, the people of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh had been deprived even as terrorism thrived. “We have made a new beginning that will usher in development and fulfil the aspirations of the local people. J&K and Ladakh is not only a piece of land within India, it’s a crown,” he said, adding that after the abrogation of Article 370, his government had to take measures there to prevent anti-national elements from carrying out subversive acts. Modi also accused the opposition of creating hurdles in the triple talaq law. “The opposition parties, led by the Congress, tried to create hurdles to prevent the passage of the triple talaq bill, as they did not want Muslim women to benefit. If they have the guts, let them publicly announce that they will do away with this law if they come to power. But they would not do so either, since they are also convinced that the law not only benefits Muslim women but also men in the community,” he said. “Muslim men are not only husbands. They are also fathers and brothers of Muslim women, and our government has brought this law to prevent any injustice to our Muslim mothers and sisters,” he said. Commenting on the Congress-NCP alliance in the state, Modi said the coalition is a “tired lot.” “The two parties have come together to fight the polls but they are incapable of fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Maharashtra. The coalition cannot work in as transparent a manner as the Devendra Fadnavis-led NDA government has,” he said. Modi said his government’s priority is to overcome the water problem in the country and his government is working hard on the issue.

"Maharashtra assembly elections: BJP using Article 370, Moon mission to divert attention, says Rahul Gandhi | Aurangabad News - Times of India","AURANGABAD: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday hit out at the BJP, saying it was diverting public attention from real issues by invoking the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and India’s Moon mission. “While campaigning in Maharashtra, PM Narendra Modi and (BJP president) Amit Shah are not uttering a single word on real issues. They are instead trying to make political mileage out of the abrogation of Article 370 and Isro’s efforts. The ruling party leaders are unmindful of the fact that public anger is mounting due to core issues such as agricultural distress and unemployment,” he said. Gandhi kickstarted his poll campaign for the assembly elections in Maharashtra from Ausa in Latur, around 290km from here, where Congress candidate Basawraj Patil has locked horns against BJP’s Abhimanyu Pawar, the personal secretary of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. At the start of his nearly 20-minute address, Gandhi took a dig at the BJP’s 2014 poll campaign by asking the audience if “acche din” had arrived. “Has unemployment affected you? Have farmers received good returns for their agricultural yield? Have loans of farmers been waived off?” he asked the large audience that had gathered in the hot and humid weather. Stepping up his attack, Gandhi alleged that farmers’ distress and unemployment are widespread across the country under the current regime. “The country is experiencing the highest rate of unemployment in the past 40 years. Over 40,000 factories have shut down. Automobile, textile and diamond industries, among others, have taken a blow,” he said. Referring to the current economic slowdown, the former Congress chief said it was just the beginning of the “disaster” ahead. “The country’s economy will be doomed in the next 6-7 months. Congress and former PM Manmohan Singh had built the economy by working hard for years, but the ruling party leaders have ruined it in no time,” he alleged. Gandhi reiterated his charge that the BJP-led government has favoured big players from the industries by waiving off loans and offering tax relief running into thousands of crores. “On the other hand, poor farmers are locked up in jails if they do not pay their dues. Demonetisation and GST implementation were aimed at snatching money from poor and lining the coffers of the rich,” he said. He also hit out at the Centre’s Make In India campaign, saying the initiative has been finished due to the influx of China-made products.

"Maharashtra elections: Centre harping on Article 370 while country in crisis, says Raj Thackeray | Mumbai News - Times of India","MUMBAI: MNS president Raj Thackeray on Sunday slammed the Centre for harping on Article 370 when the country is passing through a grave financial crisis. ""Nearly two crore people have lost jobs, industries have downed shutters and banks are collapsing. The Modi government has miserably failed to tackle the escalating economic crisis. Hence, it keeps harping on Article 370 and J&K to whip up emotions,"" alleged Thackeray. What use is there for Article 370 for Maharashtra which faces economic slowdown, loss of employment and natural calamities? But, those in power are whipping up emotional issues to sidestep key issues of development,"" he said. The Centre's plan to start a Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train was a drain on resources, he said and added that ongoing trains from Mumbai to Ahmedabad were running on a mere 48% booking. Thackeray hit out at the Centre for leaving depositors of the Punjab Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMCB) high and dry. ""The PMCB depositors have lost the savings of their lives. However, the Centre says the RBI will take a call, while the RBI has refused to take the depositors' responsibility,"" said Thackeray. He was addressing a party rally at Magathane in Borivli which has a large percentage of the PMCB depositors.

"Stop crocodile tears on Article 370, PM Modi tells opposition during a rally in Maharashtra | Pune News - Times of India","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched his poll blitz in Maharashtra by daring the opposition parties to declare in their manifestos for the assembly elections - and all future polls - that they would roll back the nullification of Article 370 and scrap the triple talaq law. Addressing a rally at Jalgaon in north Maharashtra, Modi put J&K and Ladakh at the heart of his speech to articulate how his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was going full steam ahead with ""extraordinary"" decisions while the opposition was just being a stumbling block. ""We have made a new beginning (in Kashmir) that will usher in development and fulfil the aspirations of the local people. J&K and Ladakh aren't just about a piece of land within India; together they are its crown,"" he said. ""This year, on August 5, our government took an extraordinary decision to nullify Article 370. Our opposition could not even think of this when they were in power. They are now unable to digest our decision. As a result, they have been making remarks on the issue that are only delighting our neighbour,"" he said, hinting at Pakistan. Modi then threw what he described as ""an open challenge"" to the opposition - to make a commitment in their manifestos to undo what NDA had done. ""But they will not do so, as they know that the people of the country have hailed our decision and will not spare anyone who tries to bring back Article 370. The opposition must stop shedding crocodile tears on this,"" he said. The PM also accused the opposition of trying to block the triple talaq law. ""The opposition parties, led by Congress, tried to create hurdles to prevent the passage of the triple talaq bill because they did not want Muslim women to benefit. If they have the guts, let them publicly announce that they will do away with this law if they come to power. But they wouldn't do so, as they are also convinced that the law not only benefits Muslim women but also men of the community,"" he said. ""Muslim men are not only husbands. They are also fathers and brothers of Muslim women, and our government has brought this law to prevent any injustice to our Muslim mothers and sisters."" On the Congress-NCP alliance in Maharashtra, Modi said the two parties were a ""tired lot"". ""They have come together to fight the polls, but they are incapable of fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Maharashtra. This coalition cannot work in as transparent a manner as the Devendra Fadnavis-led NDA government has."" At Sakoli in Bhandara district, his second rally of the day, the PM urged the people of the state to ensure a ""historic mandate"" for the BJP-Shiv Sena combine. Unlike in Jalgaon, he didn't mention J&K even once. He started his speech in Marathi, saying, ""I thank the people of Maharashtra for their support in the Lok Sabha elections. I had addressed a public meeting in Gondia before that election. The result proved all political pundits wrong. The result of this assembly election is known beforehand.""

 Only PM with 56-inch chest could nullify Art 370: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"KOLHAPUR: Union home minister Amit Shah credited ""PM Narendra Modi with a 56-inch chest"" for the nullification of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir saying none of his predecessors showed courage to take such a step. ""No other prime minister had the courage to abrogate Article 370. ...It was PM Narendra Modi with a 56-inch chest who showed the courage to abrogate Article 370,"" Shah said at a poll rally here. At rallies in Kolhapur and Sangli, Shah attacked NCP president Sharad Pawar for questioning the government's move on Kashmir saying the latter did not understand the pain of the families of 40,000 people who had lost their lives to terrorism. ""Kashmir was disconnected from India and Pakistan resorted to terrorist activities because of Article 370. Its nullification has made Kashmir an integral part of India,"" he said. The Union home minister also alleged that Congress leaders did not have a national security policy. ""Rahul Gandhi opposed the nullification of Article 370. However, (then PM) Manmohan Singh never uttered a word when Indian jawans were beheaded by terrorists.

 PM Modi dares opposition to declare bringing back Article 370 in manifesto | India News - Times of India,"JALGAON: Stepping up attack on the Congress and NCP over abrogation of Article 370, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday dared them to declare in their manifesto that they will bring back the provisions which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Earlier PMs couldn't do what 'man with 56-inch chest' did:ShahAddressing his first rally ahead of the October 21 Maharashtra assembly polls, Modi said Jammu and Kashmir was ""not just a parcel of land, but crown of India"", and assured it will not take more than four months to normalise the kind of situation that prevailed there for 40 years. He accused the opposition parties of politicising the issue of Article 370 and charged them with ""speaking on the same lines as that of the neighbouring country"". The Prime Minister lavished praise on the Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government for its five-year performance, which he said, was ""corruption-free"" and inspired confidence among all, including farmers and industries. Attacking the Congress and NCP, PM Modi said it was ""unfortunate"" that they were ""politicising"" the ""unprecedented"" decision of scrapping of Article 370. Their leaders thought exactly opposite of what the entire nation feels about Jammu and Kashmir, he said. ""You look at the statements made by Congress, NCP of late ... They seem to be speaking one lines of the neighbouring country,"" Modi said, without naming the leaders as he apparently referred to Pakistan. Accusing the opposition leaders of shedding crocodile tears on the issue of Article 370, he said, ""I challenge them, if they have guts, declare in their manifesto for state election and future polls too, that they will bring back Article 370 and 35A, which the BJP, the Modi government scrapped ... that they will change the August 5 decision."" ""Stop shedding these crocodile tears,"" Modi told the opposition parties. Wondering whether bringing back Article 370 will be acceptable to people, he said the opposition parties will have no future if they were to do so. Hailing the move, Modi said earlier it was ""unthinkable"" that such a decision (of abrogating the Article) could be taken, and noted that only separatism and terrorism spread in Jammu and Kashmir over the years. The scope for development of the poor, women, dalits and the exploited sections was slim, he pointed out. Members of the Valmiki community in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh were even deprived of their human rights, he said. ""Today, I can say bowing before Bhagwan Valmiki that I have the fortune of embracing those brothers,"" he added. PM Modi said there was ""no difference"" between what the BJP-led government preached and practised. He also hit out at the opposition over the issue of banning triple talaq, alleging they tried to see that Muslim sisters did not get justice. ""But, I kept the promise made to Muslim mothers and sisters,"" he said, and also challenged the opposition ""to bring back the practice of triple talaq"". Taking a dig at the opposition, Modi, without naming any party, said the ""tired allies"" can extend each other support, but cannot fulfil the dreams of Maharashtra and aspirations of its youth. Notably, senior Congress leader Sushilkumar Shinde recently remarked that both his party and the NCP are ""tired"". Without naming NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Modi also referred to a video clip featuring the veteran leader and alleged that he elbowed away a party worker as he was being garlanded at a poll rally in Akola. In the video clip, which went viral on social media recently, Pawar was purportedly seen being honoured with a big garland by NCP workers. At the same time, a party worker tried to get into the garland and was purportedly nudged by Pawar. ""I don't know whether the clip is genuine or not ... such a big leader whose photos appeared in newspapers all these years, who was seen on TV, but he has such a small heart that he elbowed the young man (the worker) as he tried to get inside (the garland),"" Modi said. Modi ""thanked"" people for reposing their faith in the BJP-led NDA government, saying their votes for an ""able and strong New India"" in the Lok Sabha elections will help the country attain the place it deserves in the world. ""Because of this mandate, India's voice is being heard by each of the world's strong force ... The world is seeing a reinvigorated New India. This not because of Modi, but because of your one vote. Only my 130 crore countrymen are behind it,"" Modi said. Praising the Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government, the Prime Minister said it ensured communal harmony in the state over the last five years and managed to inspire confidence among farmers and industries. Modi said he has come to Maharashtra to seek people's support for re-electing Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister for a second term. He also listed several works and initiatives launched by the BJP-led Centre as well as the Maharashtra government.

When our government came under Devendra Fadnavis 18,000 villages were provided with water with the help of Jal Yukt Shivar and that too by spending just Rs 9,000 crore.

The government led by the saffron party not only talked about women empowerment, but also ensured that it was done, Adityanath said, pointing out that the ruling dispensation had put an end to triple talaq. ""The land of Haryana was helpful in teaching a lesson to Pakistan.

 You will run govt or cook? Sharad Pawar on Shiv Sena's Rs 10 meal promise | India News - Times of India,"SOLAPUR: NCP chief Sharad Pawar mocked the Shiv Sena on Saturday for its poll promise to provide a meal at Rs 10, reminding that it had, in the past, introduced `zunka-bhakar' centres which later vanished. Ahead of the October 21 Maharashtra Assembly polls, the Sena has promised to provide a full meal to the poor at Rs 10. At a campaign rally at Barshi in Solapur district, Pawar reminded that in the 1990s, the first Shiv Sena-BJP alliance government had started centres to sell zunka-bhakar, a rural staple, at subsidized price. Nobody ever realised when these centres folded up and Sena workers `grabbed' the space provided for them, he said. ""And now this Rs 10 meal scheme. Are people asking you to run the state or to cook meals?"" Pawar asked. He also referred to statements by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray that the opposition was not putting up any fight in this election. ""The chief minister said their wrestler is ready, but there is none (to fight). But you fight with a wrestler, and not with 'such' people,"" Pawar said with a suggestive waving of the right hand. ""If there is no strong opponent in these polls, why there is a need for nine rallies of prime minister Narendra Modi, twenty rallies of home minister Amit Shah?"" Pawar asked. ""They will find out on October 24 when `gulal' (of victory) will be applied to our candidate,"" Pawar added. The only answer Shah, in his campaign speeches, is offering to people's questions about unemployment, agrarian issues, women's safety and development of villages was abrogation of Article 370, the NCP chief said. ""From morning to night, he talks about Article 370. You abrogated it, we are happy, we support it. But there is also Article 371 about north-eastern states (which, like 370, makes special provisions for those states). Why don't you remove Article 371?"" Pawar asked. The government which swears by warrior king Shivaji has not made any progress on the work of his memorial off the Mumbai coast, he alleged. He also questioned Fadnavis's claim of providing Rs 50,000 crore package to farmers. ""I was Union agriculture minister, I have been roaming across Maharashtra, I could not find anything (anyone benefiting). In reality, 16,000 people committed suicide during this period,"" he said.

He observed that Maharashtra was leaping forward on the path of development under the chief minister's leadership. ""The people of the state will once again bring to power the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance with an absolute majority so that the development vehicle continues to move forward,"" he added.

 Restrictions lifted in 99% areas in J&amp;K: Govt | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Restrictions on the movement of people have been lifted in ""over 99 per cent"" areas of Jammu and Kashmir, state government spokesperson Rohit Kansal said on Saturday. Speaking to reporters here, he asserted that the curbs were necessary to prevent ""externally-aided terrorists"" from disturbing peace in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of abrogation of the state's special status under Article 370 in August. He also said the cases of those who were detained, including political leaders, were being reviewed by the government for their release. Kansal said there was a gradual lifting of restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir since August 16 and most curbs were lifted by the first week of September. ""Barring eight to ten police stations, movement restrictions have now been completely removed. Over 99 per cent of the areas of Jammu and Kashmir have absolutely no movement restrictions,"" he said. He said tourists are welcome to visit the state and the government would facilitate their visit. Internet facilities are being opened at tourist spots to assist those who would want to access it, he added. The government spokesperson said the imposition of restrictions ensured that no lives were lost to terrorism. ""In the light of important constitutional changes that were made in relation to J-K in August 2019, a number of restrictions were imposed from August 4 in order to prevent externally-aided terrorists from disturbing peace and inflicting casualties on civilians,"" Kansal said. The spokesperson said it is well established that there have been sustained attempts from across the border, in the past and more so in the last two months, to promote militancy in the state to create a sense of fear among the people. ""It is also a fact that there are attempts from across the border to disturb normal life. Credible inputs continue to be received on the likelihood of large-scale terrorist attacks sponsored by forces inimical to the nation and from outside its borders,"" Kansal said. ""These terrorist attacks are meant not only to cause large-scale damage to life and property, but also create an atmosphere of fear and terror among the people of J-K, the vast majority of whom are peace loving,"" he added. Kansal said banned terrorist organisations like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Hizbul Mujahideen continue to make attempts to terrorise the people of the state. ""It was in anticipation of this, that restrictions were imposed so that externally-aided terrorism does not lead to loss of innocent lives,"" he said. ""This is remarkable, given the history of events in 2008, 2010 and 2016. Some killings and injuries have been inflicted by terrorists, including on a baby, to prevent traders, businessmen, transporters from doing their normal business,"" he said. Asked about the release of those detained in Kashmir, including political leaders, Kansal said each case is being reviewed. ""If there have been arrests, there have been releases as well. It is a dynamic process and cases are being reviewed,"" he said. Most of the top-level and second-rung separatist politicians were taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders, including two former chief ministers -- Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, were either detained or placed under house arrest on the night of August 4. On August 5, the Centre revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and announced its decision to bifurcate the state into two Union Territories. Another former chief minister and sitting Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar Farooq Abdullah has been arrested under the controversial Public Safety Act, a law enacted by his father and National Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978 when he was the chief minister. Meanwhile, normal life remained affected in Kashmir for the 69th consecutive day on Saturday as main markets continued to be shut and public transport stayed off the roads, officials said. Few vendors set up stalls on the TRC Chowk-Lal Chowk road here. Private transport was plying unhindered in Srinagar and other districts across the valley, the officials said. Students continued to stay away from schools and colleges, they said. The Kashmir valley has been witnessing continuous shutdown since August 5. In a full-page advertisement published in local dailies this week, the state administration asked people not to be afraid of militant threats and resume their normal activities.

 Kashmir issue not raised or discussed during India-China informal summit: Foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale | India News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: The Kashmir issue was not raised or discussed during the second informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale. ""This (Kashmir) issue was not raised and not discussed. Our position is anyway very clear that this is an internal matter of India,"" Gokhale said at a special press briefing following the culmination of the two-day summit. India had previously taken exception to references concerning Kashmir following talks between Xi and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan ahead of the Chinese President's visit to India for the informal meet. ""We have seen the report regarding the meeting of Chinese President Xi Jinping with Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan which also refers to their discussions on Kashmir. India's position has been consistent and clear that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. China is well aware of our position. It is not for other countries to comment on the internal affairs of India,"" Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said at a briefing this week. A joint statement released by China and Pakistan after Xi-Khan meeting on Wednesday said that Beijing is ""paying close attention to the current situation in Jammu & Kashmir"" and that the matter should be ""properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements."" In August, India abrogated Article 370 which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir, hiving the region into two Union Territories. While New Delhi has maintained that its decisions in Kashmir are entirely a matter of its internal affairs, Pakistan has tried making an issue out of it on the international platform but to no avail.

While voice calls and SMS shall be enabled, mobile internet will remain barred for now. The lifting of ban on mobile communication in the Valley comes days after the J&K government withdrew its advisory issued in early August, urging tourists to leave the state as a precautionary measure. Cellphone services in J&K were suspended ahead of abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, as part of a general lockdown imposed to prevent Pakistan-backed terrorists from disturbing peace and inflicting casualties on civilians. They were subsequently restored in Jammu and Ladakh regions and in Kupwara district of Kashmir. Monday onwards, cellphones services -- both of state-owned BSNL and private service providers -- will be up and running across all 10 districts of Kashmir. ""With this step, tourists will be able to visit the state without being handicapped by the lack of phone connectivity, students can be in touch with parents while attending schools, businessmen can be in touch with customers, transporters can contact clients, and contractors can be in touch with staff,"" said Kansal. Sources said the J&K police and security forces are geared up to tackle any eventuality on account of restoration of mobile communication, including heightened terrorist activity and attempts by Pakistan-backed separatist elements to mobilise crowds for violent protests. “The government urges businessmen, industrialists, traders, transporters, shopkeepers, hoteliers and contractors not to be frightened by the threats of terrorists and separatists and go about their normal activities. The government is firm in its resolve that the attempts of these disruptive elements will be foiled. The government thanks the people of Jammu & Kashmir for being cooperative and helping in maintaining peace and public order,” the J&K government said in a statement. Appreciating the patience of the people of J&K, the statement noted: ""It is a tribute, both to the people of Jammu & Kashmir and to the security forces, that these measures have ensured that there is no unnecessary loss of life in Jammu & Kashmir. This is remarkable, given the history of events in 2008, 2010 & 2016. Some killings and injuries have been inflicted by terrorists, including on a baby, to prevent traders, businessmen and transporters from doing their normal business"". Since August 16, there has been a gradual and phased removal of the restrictions and by the first week of September, most restrictions were removed. Barring 8-10 police stations, movement restrictions have been completely lifted, said a J&K government press release. Over 99% of the area of Jammu & Kashmir has no restrictions on movement, it added. Besides, the release said landline phones were fully restored and are functional for over six weeks now.

 Postpaid mobile phone services to resume from Monday in Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: In a major step in easing the 69 days lockdown in the Kashmir valley, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on Saturday announced restoration of all postpaid mobile phone services from Monday noon. Government spokesman and senior IAS officer Rohit Kansal told reporters that all postpaid mobile phones will be resorted from October 14 noon. The services were likely to be resumed on Saturday but a last minute technical hitch led to deferring of the resumption of services. The subscribers will have to, however, wait for some more time for Internet services to resume in the Valley, they said. The state administration has been examining various options with regard to suspension of mobile phone services which have come in for severe criticism for causing hardships to some seven million residents of the Valley. At one point it was planned to open only BSNL services followed by allowing activating only incoming calls run by private telecom operators. The move comes barely days after the Centre issued an advisory opening the Valley for tourists. Travel association bodies had approached the administration, saying that no tourist would like to come to the valley where no mobile phones working. The mobile services in Jammu and Kashmir were shut down on August 5 after the Centre announced in New Delhi the abrogation of the special status guaranteed to the state under Article 370 of the Constitution. Partial fixed line telephony was resumed in the valley on August 17, and by September 4 all landlines, numbering nearly 50,000, were declared operational.

Refresher course by Priyanka Gandhi for Congress newbies | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: The new Congress leadership in UP will have to attend and pass Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s paathshala on politics. The Congress general secretary would moderate lectures on key social, political and economic issues of Uttar Pradesh for new office-bearers at a three-day workshop from October 14. The exercise, divided into several sessions, will have modules on social media, public speaking and public connect, besides lessons and tips on giving media bytes. “Many members in the team are new and need to be apprised of party’s ideology and stand on key social, political and economic issues. Priyanka Gandhi will also speak to delegates in the workshop,” said Rajiv Tyagi, national spokesperson, Congress. Sources said issues like Article 370, triple talaq and Ram Temple will also be taken up in the workshop in addition to topics like what has Congress given to the country in the past governments. Senior party leaders said that training was integral to Congress work culture, the tradition remained irregular till the then party president Rahul Gandhi segregated training department from organisation department. Congress also had plans to set up a training centre to periodically update its members and leaders, but the project is yet to see light of the day. A section of leadership is not happy about the timing of the workshop. “Byelections are round the corner. Instead of pinning the focus on campaigning for candidates, leaders would be taking notes in the class.

Interesting fight on card in backward tribal area in Amravati | Nagpur News - Times of India,"DHARNI (MELGHAT): Jo sachhe Hindustani hain humko unse bair nahin, hat gayee 370 hain gaddaro ki khair nahin (we are not the enemies of those who are true Indians, but traitors beware, Article 370 has been scrapped), played the song on loudspeakers mounted on vehicles moving around the sleepy tribal town of Dharni in Amravati district, ahead of the visit of Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday. Amid a strong security built up, Shah visited the town in Melghat Hills, known more for malnutrition among tribals, for the first time. He is also among the few national leaders, including Indira Gandhi, to have visited this place. As Shah campaigned for BJP’s Ramesh Mavaskar, deputy commissioner (civil supplies) who quit the state government job to contest elections, sources said the visit to Dharni was planned barely a week ago. Son of a former MLA, Mavaskar is contesting for the Melghat assembly seat. The other two candidates to reckon are former BJP man and two-time MLA from Melghat, Rajkumar Patel, now contesting under the banner of Prahaar Jan Shakti headed by Achalpur MLA Bacchu Kadu, and NCP’s Kewalram Kale. The seat is reserved for tribals. Shah flew down to Dharni in a chopper from Karanja near Akola city. Party workers said earlier he was supposed to address a rally in Dhamangaon or Morshi in Amravati but the party workers insisted that Shah should rather come down to Dharni instead. “Even the chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is putting all the efforts to ensure party’s victory in Dharni. There is grapevine that if Mavaskar wins he may also be made the state’s minister for tribal affairs,” said party workers. The party is leaving no stone unturned to ensure his victory, said a grass roots level workers. Shah’s visit to this sleepy town has also fuelled another speculation in the political circles. Observes an veterans in Amravati say this means Mavaskar’s win may not be as easy. This is the reason a leader of Shah’s stature has come down all the way to Dharni, they say. Patel, who was the MLA here before 2009, is expected to be a formidable rival. Kadu already has a strong base in neighbouring Achalpur and is famous for his attention seeking stunts and firebrand image, said locals. Patel’s father Dayaram had been the state’s forest minister. Locals say Patel also enjoys a strong base among the tribals as against Mavaskar who is more considered to be an elite as he was a government officer. Amid speculations of triangular fight between Mavaskar, Patel and Kale, it’s being dubbed that the ultimate battle will be between Mavaskar and Patel. Kale refuted any chances of Patel having any major impact. “Traditionally, it has been a fight between Congress and BJP in Melghat,” he told TOI. He said his focus will be on improving the living condition of the tribals in Melghat and fighting malnutrition. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra elections: Spotlight on Article 370, Brand Modi; opposition asks what about local development | Nagpur News - Times of India","NAGPUR: The dominance of national issues such as Article 370, relations with Pakistan and the Brand Modi factor is evident in state poll campaign, leading the opposition to claim that the BJP-Shiv Sena government has nothing to show for its last five years. TOI had reported last month on how the BJP is training its workers regarding Article 370 and has planned public awareness events about the same. Even party president Amit Shah had made it clear that Kashmir issue will be the major talking point of Maharashtra polls. Ashish Deshmukh, Congress’s candidate pitted against CM Devendra Fadnavis in South-West Nagpur, said that it’s a ploy to deflect attention. “Article 370 etc have nothing to do with issues of peope in Maharashtra. Fact is that Fadnavis has failed in clearing backlog of Vidarbha and has nothing concrete to take to the people, which is why they have to rely on national issues,” said Deshmukh. He added that social media management of BJP won’t work this time. “BJP has a big paid online army that pushes these fabricated messages on social media, but it does not reflect the actual mindset of voters. The latter have realized what’s fake now,” said Deshmukh. BJP’s city president Pravin Datke disagrees saying that Deshmukh is trying to misguide people. “If he feels that local issues need to be raised then ask him to talk about problems specific to South-West constituency. Is he aware of any problem that exists there?” he said. BJP’s Nagpur Sampark Pramukh Deaven Dasture claimed that development has happened at both national and state level. “Brand Modi will be a major factor because the PM has ensured actual development. The ‘Make in Maharashtra’ campaign is modeled after Modi’s ‘Make in India’ and that has led to major investments and job creation in our state. Big brand educational institutes have been started in Nagpur under Fadnavis and Gadkari, hence to say that we don’t have any local development to talk about is incorrect,” said Dasture. According to senior academician Lalit Khullar, youth are usually susceptible to issues that project a ‘macho’ image of either a person or an issue. “Farmers’ suicides in Vidarbha, or the loan distress are not glamarous enough for majority of the youth. They would prefer following up on issues that are trending even though it may have no connection with Vidarbha. WhatsApp and Google are the go-to centres of knowledge for many of our youth, and they decide their thought-process,” said Khullar. Dr Sanjay Deshpande, a well-known medical practitioner, said that while national issues are important, people must differentiate between types of elections. “State polls are there to discuss issues related to a specific geographical area. I feel parties should be talking about violence against doctors, bureaucratic challenges being faced by small nursing homes and even excess reservations in jobs and education,” said Dr Deshpande. Gaurav Choukasey, a businessman said that it will come down to people choosing between emotive and real issues. “Emotive issues like Article 370 and Ram Mandir will always find a soft corner with people, forcing them to overlook immediate local issues. And real issues like economic slowdown, farmer distress have all been sidelined because the opposition is in complete disarray and unable to make local issues a talking point,” said Choukasey.

Amit Shah seeks apology from Rahul Gandhi on Kashmir issue | Nagpur News - Times of India,"BULDHANA/MELGHAT: Union home minister and BJP national president Amit Shah on Friday targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over a delegation of the party’s overseas UK unit meeting Britain’s Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and discussing Kashmir. Corbyn has been vocal against India on Kashmir. “Rahul Gandhi must apologize for this as it is against India’s stated stand that there will be no third party role in Kashmir and the state is India’s internal matter. Rahul Gandhi should clarify his stand on the issue,” he said. After the meeting, the Congress disowned its overseas Congress unit in the UK, saying it is not authorized to talk on India’s internal matters with outsiders. Addressing an election rally in Buldhana district, Shah slammed the opposition for criticizing scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the historic decision. Shah said these are first elections in Maharashtra (and also in Haryana) after scrapping of Article 370 on August 5 and they provide an opportunity to voters to show they are one on this crucial issue. “The people of Maharashtra have a choice to make. The Congress and NCP work for the welfare of their respective families, whereas the BJP and Shiv Sena have only the country’s interest on their mind,” Shah said. He challenged NCP chief Sharad Pawar to debate on his 55 years of work on the “chauraha” (crossroad) of Nagpur. “I will send the president of the BJP Yuva Morcha (the party’s youth wing) to debate with him,” Shah said. At another rally in Dharni, a remote town in Melghat constituency in Amravati district, he said even the tribals find a connect with Kashmir. “I have heard that Mr Pawar has questioned what has Article 370 has to do with Maharashtra. I am asking the tribals of Melghat who have come here for the rally, do you have no relation with Kashmir. Leave aside Maharashtra people of the entire country are ready to lay down their lives for Kashmir,” said Shah. “When I reached the Parliament with the amendment bill on Article 370, I was warned by Congress and NCP that there will be bloodbath after that. Both Gandhi and Pawar should take note that it has been two months since the special status was removed, not a drop of blood has been shed and people of Kashmir are happy,” he said. Continuing with the statements made during the election rallies held at Haryana, Shah, who was addressing an over 15,000 strong audience, mainly of tribals coming from nearby Melghat Hills, also raised topics like Howdy Modi, and clearing the country of infiltrators. Shah in a reference to NRC said the BJP government will throw each and every infiltrator out of the country by 2024, no matter how much hue and cry is raised by Sharad Pawar and Rahul Gandhi. After listing the works done during the BJP government in the state since 2014, like easing the rules for bamboo transport, bringing power lines to the tribal villages, higher allocation for tribal development, Shah came back to the Article 370 and international politics. “A number of things may have happened for Melghat during the Devendra Fadnavis regime, but more than that I would stress that India has won respect globally. At the Howdy Modi event, even US president Trump was amazed to see the support Modi enjoyed and had to say that he is the most popular global leader,” said Shah. Directly naming the Congress leaders, he said when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, Pakistan used to carry out terror attacks in the country at will. There have been no corruption charges against Modi and Fadnavis, hence it means that there is a non-corrupt government unlike earlier regime. Irrigation works worth RS 70,000 crore were undertaken under the Congress-BJP regime but hardy any results can be seen. On the other hand Fadnavis has irrigated over 18,000 hectares by spending just Rs9,000 crore under the Jalyukta Shivar, he said.

Uddhav Thackeray says Congress-NCP to blame for farm crises in Maharashtra | Pune News - Times of India,"PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said the Congress and the NCP, during their rule in the state, had made farming difficult for people. He was addressing a rally for three BJP-Shiv Sena-RPI (A) and other alliance candidates in Pimpri on Friday. “We have fulfilled two important assurances given during the Lok Sabha elections__one is Article 370— for which I congratulate home minister Amit Shah. Kashmir is an integral part of India. NCP leader Sharad Pawar said after the abrogation of Article 370 who will go there to farm? You (Congress-NCP) created such conditions that it was difficult to practise agriculture in the state and we are facing the consequences,” he said at the rally. On Congress-NCP’s farm loan waiver promise, he said, “We will not give ‘karjamafi’ to farmers as one who has committed a crime is given ‘mafi’. We will make them ‘karjamukta’ (free of loans) after coming to power.” He also promised funds to 15 lakh educated youth to earn a living and slum rehabilitation schemes in Pimpri assembly constituency. Thackeray said ‘one rupee clinics’ will be started if they returned to power. “They will be opened in various districts. Check-ups are expensive and these clinics will conduct them for just a rupee,” he said. He said Congress and NCP had committed wrongdoings and were being questioned about it. “We need to know where Rs 70,000 crore from the irrigation scam and the money from co-op banks scam have gone,” he said.

 LoC saw 600 ceasefire violations in 2 months | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Line of Control with Pakistan remains extremely volatile, with over 600 ceasefire violations being recorded over the last two months and New Delhi warning Islamabad to desist from targeting civilian areas in the ongoing cross-border mortar and artillery duels. Army sources on Friday said the hotline between the two directorate generals of military operations was used last week to warn the Pakistan Army to stop shelling civilian areas or be prepared to face the consequences.  The Army commanders' conference, which will be held from October 14 to 19 under the chairmanship of General Bipin Rawat, is also slated to review the operational situation along the LoC with Pakistan as well as the ""northern borders"" with China. ""The apex level leadership of Indian Army will brainstorm on all the current emerging security and administrative challenges to chart the future course for the force,"" said a senior officer. Overall, the number of ceasefire violations (CFVs) recorded by the Indian Army along the 778-km long LoC has already crossed 2,320 this year, breaking all annual records since 2003.  The security forces have gunned down 147 terrorists in different operations along the LoC as well in the hinterland in J&K, while 31 soldiers have laid down their lives till now this year. ""There has also been frequent calibre-escalation during the CFVs, which in effect means that heavy mortars and artillery guns are coming into play instead of just small arms and light mortars. The Indian Army is responding pro-actively,"" said a source. The already violent LoC turned especially red-hot after the Modi government on August 5 revoked the special status of J&K and moved to split the state into two Union Territories. ""Though there was an upward trend in the CFVs since July, the number drastically shot up after August 5. There were 307 CFVs in August. In September, the number stood at 292, which is triple the number of CFVs recorded in September in 2017 and 2018,"" said the source. In July 2018, the Army had recorded 13 cases of CFVs, followed by 44 in August and 102 in September. In 2017, there were 68 cases of CFVs in July, followed by 108 in August and 101 in September. Just in September, there were as many as 61 incidents of calibre-escalation, with the two armies targeting each other with light artillery guns, anti-tank guided missiles and heavy mortars with civilians being often caught in the middle. The fiercest cross-border duels have taken place in areas like Nowshera, Poonch, Bhimber Gali and Krishna Ghati, among others. ""Pak Army often uses CFVs to push in infiltrators across the LoC. The Pak Army-ISI combine is desperate to plug the leadership void among the terror outfits in the valley. In September, for instance, 28 terrorists attempted to cross LoC, as per intelligence estimates, but only around a dozen managed to get through,"" said the source.

" Congress is like driverless train, pilotless plane: Yogi Adityanath | India News - Times of India","AMBALA/SONIPAT: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday likened the Congress to a ""driverless train"" and a ""pilotless plane"", taking a dig at the party that remains without a full-time president. Adityanath was addressing poll rallies in support of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is aiming to return to power in Haryana after the October 21 assembly polls.  ""The condition of the Congress is like that of a driverless train and a pilotless plane as Rahul Gandhi resigned from his post of president after the party's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, and now even after four months the party has no president,"" he said at an election rally.  The Congress picked Sonia Gandhi as its interim president after Rahul Gandhi refused to take back his resignation.  Addressing election meetings in Ambala, Sonipat, Jind and Panchkula, Adityanath accused the Congress of corruption when it was in power in the state.  The BJP leader praised Narendra Modi for increasing the clout of the country and ensuring its security, bringing up the Balakot air strikes.  ""Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan who earlier used to threaten to attack India is now pleading that India should not attack them,"" he said.  ""It is fanciful thinking to expect the country's development from a party that does not have a future of its own,"" the UP chief minister said.  He accused Rahul Gandhi of ""fleeing"" from the country, saying the Congress leader knew the results of the upcoming assembly polls.  Gandhi is, however, in the country -- and even appeared before a court this week -- after speculation over a visit abroad.  Adityanath indirectly referred to allegations by Congress rebel Ashok Tanwar, who quit the party after claiming that bribes were being paid for tickets.  ""The Congress has neither the country nor Haryana to put up for sale, so now the party leaders are selling tickets and their party,"" he said.  He claimed that the Congress does not take pride in country's increasing strength.  ""Congressmen ridiculed defence minister Rajnath Singh when he performed the 'shastra pujan' of a Rafale fighter jet on Vijayadashami,"" he said, referring to the ritual conducted during the recent handing over of the plane to India.  Massive investment is taking place in the state these days due to the policies of the Haryana government, Adityanath claimed.  Mentioning the Karnal-born American astronaut who died in a US space mission, the BJP leader said Haryana's daughter Kalpana Chawla had brought laurels to the state and the country.  He blamed the previous Congress governments in Haryana for the state's skewed gender ratio, and claimed that it is being set right through Narendra Modi government's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' campaign.  ""Dishonesty and corruption are part of the DNA of Congressmen,"" he charged, and also alleged that the previous governments in Haryana used to auction jobs.  ""As many as 72,000 youths got government jobs in a transparent manner and without any discrimination when BJP's Manohar Lal Khattar government took charge in Haryana,"" he claimed.  He also referred to alleged land scams by Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra.  ""The 'damad ji' scam also took place in Haryana. The Congress 'damad ji' (son-in-law) did not leave even a single patch of land from Gurgaon to Panchkula, where he set new records in corruption,"" he alleged.  He mentioned the large turnout at the Kumbh mela organised by his government in Uttar Pradesh, comparing it with the Commonwealth Games held at far greater expense in Delhi when the Congress was in power at the Centre.

 India raises with Pakistan issue of targeting civilians in ceasefire violations | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India has raised with Pakistan the issue of targeting civilians during ceasefire violations along the Line of Control which has seen a spike since the repealing of special provisions of Article 370 in August, Army sources said on Friday. The issue was raised by the Army during the functional level talks held by the Directorate General of Military Operations with its Pakistani counterpart on October 1. Last month, the Army rescued school students amid shelling in the Poonch district, an official said. In July, there were 296 cases of ceasefire violations (CFVs), 307 in August and 292 in September, sources said.

Army sources also said that the July-September period of this year recorded only 24 cases of 'terrorist-initiated incidents' as against 114 and 31 in the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2017, respectively. They claimed that 85 cases of pelting of stones, five incidents of civil protest and three instances of bandh were reported in the Valley in September.

""Nearly all countries supporting India after it scrapped Article 370, or big and powerful countries honouring prime minister Modi with their highest civilian awards, it all clearly establishes India's growing strength across the world,"" Naqvi was quoted as saying in a statement. He credited Modi with removing ""stains of failures"" of 10-year rule of the Congress-led UPA. The NDA government at the Centre succeeded on several fronts including national security, economy and foreign policy, the minister said. The world now looks at India with a ""positive approach"", Naqvi said. Major countries of the world are with India in the fight against terrorism, and the world now realizes that Pakistan has become a ""factory of terrorism"", he said. On economy, Naqvi said the foreign exchange reserves have touched a record high of $434 billion. India has become the ""most attractive and safe"" investment and manufacturing hub of the world due to the ""historic and big"" economic reforms undertaken by the Modi government, he claimed.

The Kashmir valley has been witnessing continuous shutdown since August 5 when the Centre revoked the state's special status under Article 370 and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.

"Jeremy Corbyn creates row by tweeting on his meet with Congress leaders, party clarifies Kashmir India’s internal matter - Times of India","LONDON: UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn’s tweet on Thursday about “a very productive meeting” on Kashmir with leaders of the Indian Overseas Congress (IOC) has created a controversy for Congress in the middle of campaigning for assembly polls, forcing it to clarify that it had only met the British MP to oppose a motion passed by his party recently which said there was a “humanitarian crisis” in Kashmir. Posting his picture with senior leaders of IOC (UK), including its president Kamal Dhaliwal, Corbyn tweeted: “A very productive meeting with UK representatives from the Indian Congress Party where we discussed the human rights situation in Kashmir. There must be a de-escalation and an end to the cycle of violence and fear which has plagued the region for so long.” A very productive meeting with UK representatives from the Indian Congress Party where we discussed the human right… https://t.co/cU5n3uCm3H— Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) 1570642862000The statement prompted a host of reactions from Congress leaders, who stressed that any issue pertaining to J&K was an internal affair of India. Notwithstanding Congress’s reactions, senior sources at Labour head office told TOI that the tweet was “entirely accurate”. Clarifying on the objective of the meeting, IOC (UK) spokesperson Sudhakar Goud told TOI: “We don’t accept interference from any external country in our internal matters. There are no human rights violations in Kashmir. And if there were any, we would fight them internally. We said that the only concern we had was about the way BJP had revoked Article 370 without consulting the J&K assembly and clampdown on communications."" Congress leader Anand Sharma said in Delhi that he was “shocked by this misrepresentation and any unauthorised statement” made on behalf of his party. “No chapter of IOC has the mandate to speak on any matter that pertains to policy on domestic issues. They are supposed to be confined to diaspora. The Congress party's position is firm and clear, as given in the CWC resolution, that any issue pertaining to J&K is India's internal affairs. We are conveying this to the Labour Party leadership,"" he said. Goud said at the meeting, IOC (UK) had raised concerns of the diaspora about London mayor Sadiq Khan, who is of Pakistani origin, “supporting” the violent protests outside the High Commission of India. “Corbyn said it was not true and that Sadiq was sad about it. He also told us there was no National Executive Committee approval of the emergency motion and he himself was not happy with it but that it got through without proper debate as it was an emergency motion. I don’t think Labour will withdraw it but they will issue a statement,” Goud said. Dhaliwal said they had met Corbyn on his invitation “to discuss the situation in Kashmir”. “We told him that the Labour Party should not interfere in India’s internal matter and Kashmir is an integral part of India and the Labour Party’s resolution on Kashmir is inappropriate.” “As everyone knows, the root cause of unrest in Kashmir stems from Pakistan. We urged Corbyn to put pressure on Pakistan to stop funding and providing training to terrorist groups in Pakistan. He should speak on that,” Dhaliwal added. The Labour Party has been criticised for having an anti-Semitism stance since Corbyn’s election as leader in September 2015 with many in the party being vocal against Israel. Corbyn has also been criticised for having links to the IRA, Hamas and Hezbollah.

 Shiv Sena never destabilised BJP-led government: Uddhav Thackeray | India News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said his party never destabilised the BJP-led government in Maharashtra and always played a key role in the state's development. Thackeray, whose party suffered a setback when it lost the Aurangabad Lok Sabha seat to the AIMIM six months ago, asserted that this time, the Sena will ensure candidates of the Hyderabad-based outfit lose their security deposit. ""When the saffron alliance won a majority of Lok Sabha seats all over the country, it lost Aurangabad. Citizens were angry here and hence didn't vote for the Sena candidate. ""We lost one election, but it's not all over. This is the time to correct that mistake. We will surely seize the deposit of the AIMIM this time here (in assembly polls),"" Thackeray said. The Sena chief was addressing a poll rally here in central Maharashtra. State AIMIM president Imtiyaz Jaleel won from Aurangabad defeating his nearest rival, Chandrakant Khaire of the Shiv Sena, by a narrow margin of 4,492 votes. ""The Shiv Sena has played a vital role in development of the state. Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray gave the idea of Mumbai-Pune expressway, though the project was completed by (former PWD minister) Nitin Gadkari. ""Today when Samruddhi Highway (connecting Mumbai with Nagpur) is under-construction, Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena (a minister in the BJP-led government) is playing a key role in it. We never tried to make this government unstable,"" he said. After scrapping Article 370, which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir, enactment of a Uniform Civil Code and action against Bangladeshi infiltrators should be on agenda now, the Sena chief said. ""The central government's move to nullify Article 370 was welcomed by our party. We are expecting implementation of a Uniform Civil Code and action against Bangladeshi infiltrators now,"" Thackeray said. The BJP and the Sena are contesting 162 and 126 assembly seats, respectively, in the October 21 polls. The state has a 288-member assembly.

 Modi-Xi summit to focus on how to move beyond differences: Chinese media | India News - Times of India,"BEIJING: As Chinese President Xi Jinping heads to India on Friday for his 2nd informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, official media in China said, their meeting would focus more on how to move beyond the historical and present differences to   forge a cooperative partnership   . Xi is scheduled to leave Beijing for Chennai early on Friday and reach the city by late noon to be in time for his 2nd informal meeting with PM Narendra Modi at the nearby   picturesque Mamallapuram tourist centre   . Ahead of Xi-Modi meet, India, China talk tough on KashmirAbout the summit, Chinese vice foreign minister, Luo Zhaohui told the media on Wednesday that, officials of both sides have made meticulous preparations for the summit through close interactions. ""Now the solid ground has been laid. With the joint efforts of the two sides President Xi's visit to India will be a full success and set the tone and direction for further growth of bilateral ties and lead to new progress and fruitful results in exchange of cooperation between the two sides,"" he said. ""Since it is an informal meeting, the two leaders will have a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere to have free exchange of views without fixed topics,"" he added. Quick Edit: India, China remain far apart on core issuesAlso no agreements were expected to be signed. Starting from Friday evening, PM Modi and President Xi were expected to have several meetings, mostly accompanied just by their translators to discuss the way forward for the Sino-India ties which faced numerous headwinds, especially over Beijing's backing to Pakistan's shrilled campaign against India over the revocation of Article 370, removing the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. While Luo struck a highly positive note, a surprisingly candid editorial in the state-run China Daily on Thursday said it remains to be seen what the two leaders can accomplish in the next two days. ""The belated official announcement of Xi's visits to the country's two South Asian neighbours, (India and Nepal) only 48 hours ahead of the informal meeting, was proof that Beijing and New Delhi cherish the opportunity to improve bilateral ties through the personal chemistry between their top leaders,"" the editorial said. Ahead of Xi Jinping's visit, security heightened in Mamallapuram""That both Beijing and New Delhi announced the meeting will take place, quashed the earlier speculation that the two leaders would postpone any meeting and sent the reassuring message that they want nothing to get in the way of constructive engagement,"" it said. ""Xi's meeting with PM Modi in the southern Indian city of Chennai on Friday and Saturday is expected to focus more on the two countries' historical and present differences, and how to move beyond them to realise their cooperation potential,"" it said. ""While it remains to be seen what Xi and PM Modi can accomplish in Chennai, the potential of greater bilateral engagement certainly supports a relationship that is far more positive than one that is just stable,"" it added. China this week appeared to have softened its stand on Kashmir, with foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang while replying to a question on the issue omitted references to UN and UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. China whose traditional stand on Kashmir issue was that it should be peacefully resolved between India and Pakistan, started referring to UN and UNSC resolutions, after Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi's visit to Beijing days after India revoked article 370 on August 5. China also backed Pakistan's call for an informal UNSC meeting on Kashmir, which ended without any statement, and its foreign minister Wang Yi in his address to the UN General Assembly said ""no actions that would unilaterally change the status quo should be taken"". Geng's comments this week raised hopes of China softening its stance ahead of the Chennai summit, but Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit along with army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and their meeting with Xi has drastically changed Beijing's stance. It is still a mystery why China worked out the visit of Khan just ahead of Xi's trip to India. In his meeting, Xi assured Khan that the friendship between China and Pakistan is ""unbreakable and rock-solid"" despite changes in the international and regional situation. He also said, ""China is paying close attention to the Kashmir situation and the facts are clear"". A joint press release issued at the end of Khan's visit said China was “paying close attention to the current situation in Jammu & Kashmir and reiterated that the Kashmir issue is a dispute left from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements."" ""China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation. Parties need to settle disputes and issues in the region through dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect,"" it said. India reacted sharply to Xi's references on Kashmir with the external affairs ministry saying, Beijing is ""well aware"" of New Delhi's position and it is not for other countries to comment on its internal affairs. Indian government sources also said there was no question of any discussion on the issue as it is India's sovereign matter but added that PM Modi will update Xi on the matter if there is a query. On Thursday, Geng, however, treaded cautiously, declining to go into China's stand on Kashmir in detail. Asked at a media briefing whether the Kashmir issue would figure in Xi-Modi talks, Geng said, ""China's position on the Kashmir issue is consistent and clear”. ""On President Xi and Prime Minister Modi's meeting, we will release information in due course,"" he added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" PoJK displaced persons' delegation calls on Union minister Singh, thanks govt for resettlement package | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: A delegation of Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) displaced persons on Thursday called on Union minister Jitendra Singh and thanked him for the government's decision to include 5,300 families in the rehabilitation package. The meeting came a day after the Centre approved a resettlement package under which Rs 5.5 lakh will be given to each of the 5,300 displaced families which had come from PoK, initially settled outside Jammu and Kashmir and later relocated to the state. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here. The delegation members wanted to seek certain clarifications about the implementation part of the decision and requested that the benefits of the rehabilitation package should be uniformly available to 5,300 displaced families which had been left out of the package earlier and the procedure for this should be simple. Singh arranged a meeting of the delegation - comprising Mahendra Mehta, Shyam Gupta, Madan Mohan, Bodh Raj, Manoj Khandelwal and others - with senior officers of the Union home ministry dealing with the rehabilitation package. The members of the delegation said their inputs and suggestions were received with patience, which the Home Ministry would examine in course of time and try to make the procedure as simple and convenient as possible. Describing the cabinet decision as yet another major breakthrough for Jammu and Kashmir under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, Singh said the government has the capacity and courage to resolve these issues. The minister appealed to ""guard against false rumours or misinformation sought to be spread by certain vested interests, who are uncomfortable with the government's decisive approach to resolve all the Jammu and Kashmir related matters, whether that be Article 370, 35-A or West Pakistan Refugees or PoJK displaced persons or Kashmiri Pandits"". Singh assured that the new set up after October 31 will unfold huge benefits. The cabinet on Wednesday approved the inclusion of the families from Jammu and Kashmir which were displaced in 1947 and had initially moved out of the state but later on returned, in the Centre's rehabilitation package. In the wake of the 1947 Pakistani aggression in Jammu and Kashmir, 31,619 families migrated from PoJK to Jammu and Kashmir. Of these, 26,319 families settled in Jammu and Kashmir and 5,300 families initially moved to other parts of the country. Further, during the Indo-Pak wars of 1965 and 1971, a total of 10,065 more families were displaced from Chhamb-Niabat area. Of these, 3,500 families were displaced during the 1965 war and 6,565 families were displaced during the 1971 war. The 36,384 displaced families covered under the package approved by the cabinet in 2016 included 26,319 displaced families from PoJK settled in Jammu and Kashmir and 10,065 displaced families displaced from Chhamb-Niabat area. The 5,300 displaced families of PoJK who initially moved out of Jammu and Kashmir were not included in the approved package in 2016 but are now being included, according to an official statement.

" Maharashtra polls: Sharad Pawar, Amit Shah slug it out over use of Article 370 as election issue | India News - Times of India","NAGPUR/LATUR: Union home minister Amit Shah and NCP president Sharad Pawar on Thursday sparred over BJP's use of Article 370 as an issue in the Maharashtra assembly elections. Pawar, addressing a rally at Hingna near Nagpur, said his party welcomed the abrogation of Article 370, but the BJP was exploiting it to target Opposition. Responding to the attack, Amit Shah said his party will raise the issues concerning national security. ""One cannot get votes by constantly raising Pulwama (terror attack), Article 370 issues. The article was abrogated in Parliament. Today, the leaders of the BJP are asking us our opinion about it,"" Pawar said at Hingna. Shah, earlier in the day, had sought to know whether Pawar and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi were in favour of the abrogation of Article 370 or against it. ""Parliament abrogated the Article. Only four-five people opposed it. What they (those who opposed) said was that the decision can be taken, but the people in Kashmir should be taken into confidence first,"" Pawar said. ""But the rulers today are criticising the opponents by raising the Article 370 issue instead of talking about what they are doing to resolve basic issues of people,"" he added. Why doesn't the Narendra Modi government ""show courage"" to also scrap Article 371 of the Constitution, which bars people from other parts of India from buying land in the northeastern states, Pawar said. ""You scrapped Article 370, why don't you show the courage to scrap 371? We will support you...They (BJP) are misleading people in the name of 370, Pulwama,"" Pawar alleged. He also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of seeking political mileage out of air strikes on terror camps in Balakot after the Pulwama terror attack in February. The former Union minister said the decision to take hard measure to combat terrorism was taken ""unanimously"" by all-party leaders (at a meeting called by Defence Minister) and not by a ""single individual"", he said. ""But political mileage was sought out of the valour shown by security forces, which was not right,"" Pawar said. Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi did not seek to exploit, politically, the victory in the 1971 war, he said. ""She gave credit to the security forces. But political mileage was sought ...(after Balakot) and the BJP benefited from it in the Lok Sabha polls,"" he added. Agrarian crisis deepened on the BJP's watch but the government did not pay heed, he said. Pawar also alleged that ""not an inch of work"" was carried out on Chhatrapati Shivaji Memorial in the Arabian sea after Modi inaugurated the work (in December 2016). Countering Pawar at a rally in Latur's Killari, Shah said the issue of national security and Article 370 was ""important"" for the BJP. ""Sharad Pawar and leaders of Congress asked me is Article 370 the only issue ... Maharashtra runs on the ethos of Shivaji Maharaj's swarajya (self-rule). The issue of national security will be discussed in the polls,"" the BJP chief said. ""You run away if you want, we will definitely appeal to people of Maharashtra on the issue of national security,"" he added. ""You cannot face us on the issue of development, Pawar Saheb. You (Congress-NCP government) gobbled up money of the poor people of Maharashtra,"" he alleged. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Tourism stakeholders not upbeat about lifting of travel restrictions in Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Tourism stakeholders in Kashmir are not upbeat about the revival of the sector even after the state government withdrew its security advisory of August 2 which had asked tourists in the Valley to leave. In that advisory issued days before the Centre announced abrogation of provisions of Article 370 and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories, the state government had asked the tourists in the valley to curtail their stay. The advisory led to the exodus of tourists from Kashmir and had a huge impact on the sector. After the Centre scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5, the valley was shut and has since been in a lockdown, leading to losses to stakeholders in the peak tourist season. On October 9, the state government withdrew the security advisory, saying the tourists desirous of undertaking a visit to the state, would be provided all necessary assistance and logistical support. However, tourism stakeholders in Kashmir are not impressed. ""This would help, but the complete revival of the tourism in Kashmir is not possible until and unless the restrictions on the communication are lifted,"" Asif Burza, president of a hotel industry association of Kashmir, told PTI. He said tourists are likely to avoid travelling to Kashmir due to the prevailing situation and the continued suspension of mobile and internet services in the valley. Bilal Ahmad, a Shikara owner in the famous Dal Lake, said the months of September and October are the peak season in the valley because of a rush of tourists from various states especially West Bengal due to Puja holidays, which the valley has lost. There is no hope of a brisk arrival of visitors due to the prevailing situation, he claimed. ""The season is gone. This time around, the Dal lake used to be full of tourists. But see around, this place looks deserted. I do not see many of them coming as the situation is such,"" Ahmad said. A tour operator, who did not wish to be identified, said organising bookings and other logistical support for the tourists would be extremely difficult due to restrictions on mobile and internet services. ""We cannot reach the tourists and they cannot reach us. How do we know which tourist has booked for Kashmir? How do hotels know about the arrival of the tourists? All this happens systematically and in the absence of the mobile and internet services, all this becomes extremely difficult,"" he said. The tour operator said the government needs to restore mobile and internet, even if only leased-line or BSNL's broadband services, to ensure logistical support to the tourists intending to visit the valley. He said there are other issues like safety and security which the government needs to take care of. The stakeholders said they have brought such issues to the notice of the government and expressed hope that the administration would address those issues. ""Tourism in Kashmir is on ventilator and needs serious help. The government has assured us that it will look into these issues,"" Burza said.

Addressing poll rallies in Maharashtra's Sangli and Solapur districts to campaign for the BJP, Shah accused the Congress and NCP of opposing the move for their politics of vote bank and appeasement. The BJP president lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for strengthening India's image across the world. He claimed the Congress and NCP have already conceded defeat ahead of the October 21 Maharashtra polls, and urged people to re-elect the BJP-Shiv Sena and allies with two-third majority, or 222 out of total 288 seats, in the state. Shah also asked Pawar to come clear on what the Congress-NCP governments did for people of Maharashtra. ""After becoming prime minister again, Modiji brought a historic proposal in Parliament...he did a great job of abrogating Article 370 and 35A from Kashmir ... Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's dream of an integrated India stands fulfilled today,"" Shah told a gathering in Sangli's Jat area. He said the Congress and NCP, however, opposed Modi and the proposal. ""I want to ask Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and NCP chief Sharadraoji Pawar, Sharadraoji should tell the people of Maharashtra whether you are in favour of scrapping Article 370 or not?"" Shah asked. ""I want to ask why did you oppose the proposal when the entire country wanted Kashmir to be an integral part of India. Because you wanted to play politics of vote bank, of appeasement,"" he charged. Shah said Gandhi and the Congress had claimed that ""river of blood"" was flowing in Kashmir. Dismissing the same, the BJP chief said Kashmir is peaceful and ""not a single bullet"" was required to be fired. ""These people ran a false campaign in the country and across the world following the scrapping of Article 370, saying it will lead to problems. Modiji went to the UN, the entire world is standing with him on the issue, while Pakistan stands isolated in the world,"" he added. Shah also sought to underscore a difference between the Congress and BJP over the issue of national security, saying his party gives priority to the nation's interest. To drive home his point, Shah said late BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the first to congratulate former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi after erstwhile Pakistan was divided into two parts (leading to creation of Bangladesh) following the India-Pakistan war in 1971. ""We were in opposition, but for us nation's interest was before the party's interest. But you are opposing the scrapping Article 370, surgical strike and Air Force's strike in Balakot,"" Shah alleged. The Indian security forces carried out surgical and air strikes in Pakistan after terror attacks in Uri and Pulwama. Under Modi's watch, the national security has strengthened, Shah said, adding that ""the entire world has realised that if one Indian jawan is martyred, 10 enemies would be killed."" Shah also accused Rahul Gandhi of siding with the ""tukde tukde gang"" as he referred to the JNU sloganeering episode. ""Rahulji, if you want, you can abuse me, my party, Modiji. We will not say anything to you. But if you stand with those talking about disintegrating 'Bharat Mata', the BJP-led government will jail those who speak about disintegrating the country,"" he said. Unlike the Mahmohan Singh-led UPA regime, there is a change in the way world perceives India now, Shah said, and credited Modi for bringing about the change. Addressing another rally in Solapur's Akkalkot area, Shah accused Rahul Gandhi of speaking on the same lines as Pakistan. ""Rahul Gandhi demanded evidences of surgical strike, so did Pakistan. Rahul Gandhi and Pakistan opposed scrapping of Article 370. I fail to understand why Pakistan and Rahul Gandhi are on the same lines,"" he said. He said that former prime minister Manmohan Singh made more foreign trips than Modi, but the latter made more impact. Shah also accused the Congress and NCP of encouraging dynastic politics and claimed the Devendra Fadnavis government in the state fared better in all areas than the previous dispensations.

"On Haryana poll stage, Manohar Lal Khattar talks Article 370, Modi government’s ‘resolve’ | Gurgaon News - Times of India","GURUGRAM: Nationalism with a dash of the local – that’s chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s campaign formula for the assembly polls. Long before other parties had even begun strategising for the election, BJP was on the road with the Jan Ashirvad Yatra – roadshows by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar across all 90 constituencies from August 18 to September 8. The yatra set the tone for BJP’s agenda in Haryana — a sharp focus on national matters with a reiteration of two local issues: jobs and corruption. And if 2014 was all about the NaMo wave, his supporters were determined to make 2019 about him. A group of volunteers, ‘Apna Modi Apna Manohar’, have come up with the term ‘MaNo’ to drive home the ‘NaMo’ link and establish a personality cult around him. And the issues that dominate his speeches remain, largely, national — Article 370, Pulwama, India’s presence in the global stage and so on. “Removing Article 370 was our resolve and we did it. I dare Congress to make their stand on the issue clear. They are confused … The Centre is dealing with terrorism with a strong hand, while Congress chief Sonia Gandhi shed tears after the death of a terrorist,” Khattar said on Wednesday at a rally in Sohna, going back to the oft-repeated BJP claim that the Congress interim president had cried for those killed in the Batla House encounter. Playing up the nationalism plank, Khattar trained guns on Congress over the ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ remark made by its Gurugram candidate Sukhbir Kataria. “They (Congress) cannot see beyond a family while for us, the country is our mother and everyone in the state is our family member,” Khattar said. The rhetoric was low on local issues. The Kherki Daula toll plaza did not find a mention, nor did the Aravalis. But Khattar had an explanation: “Why should we not talk about the nation? We are part of this nation. Along with national issues, we will also talk about the work we have done in Haryana and in other states.” Zooming in on the local issues that top his agenda, employment and corruption, Khattar said, “Corrupt practices landed one former chief minister in jail and another ex-CM is on his way to prison.” He went on, “Under BJP, most government services have been taken online. The change in the system has left middlemen and brokers unemployed.” The chief minister promised to make the utilisation of government funds even more transparent with a social audit system, in which qualified people from the society will assess the work done and audit the funds used at the panchayat level.

"When CM told partymen, ‘Give me a chance to speak’ | Gurgaon News - Times of India","SOHNA: For a long time, Manohar Lal Khattar, who came out of anonymity in 2014 and was appointed Haryana chief minister, appeared unsure. Halting in his speech, he gave the impression that he’d rather be elsewhere. But Khattar has warmed to his task, and embraced the challenges of governing a state. So much so that, before he helicoptered his way to Sohna (after a stopover in Rewari), speaker after speaker extolled what they believed was his transformative leadership.  On Wednesday, a confident Khattar played to the gallery by equating Congress with corruption (and taking potshots at The Family). He also tapped into the prevailing mood, in Haryana and across the country, which maintains that the BJP alone is capable of taking decisive action (sample the scrapping of Article 370) and protecting the nation’s borders (Pulwama). “Why did you call me here if you were going to detail all that I have achieved?” he joshed with a party functionary. “At least give me the chance to say something!” Before the main course was the starters, overdone with the full-throated, megaphone variety of nationalism. The obligatory ‘Bolo, Bharat Mata ki Jai’, was repeated on loop, not all the time with the gusto those on the dais wanted the crowd to summon. Aurangzeb Khan from Punhana, who not long ago was seeking a ticket, set the tone with his party-above-self loyalty, even warning that pressing the wrong button would not be a wise move. Meanwhile, Mahant Balaknath, BJP member of parliament for Alwar, asserted that the Ram Mandir will indeed be built (and soon). Cue, applause. Another thundered that the day of Akhand Bharat is not too far away, now that Article 370 has been done away with. “Modi taking office in 2014 set right all the wrongs of the past,” he added, for effect. Khattar promised more ‘vikas’ if voted back. Of course, the thought of BJP not returning to power was not even barely entertained, so bullish were the party faithful about another five years. But, 75 seats? “Even 90 seats won’t be enough,” argued the Mahant. The men of the BJP (for there were no women on the stage) did their best to outdo each other in chest-thumping patriotism and allegiance to party. It felt more like a victorious homecoming than a campaign halt. And the folks in Sohna were happy to oblige. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Shehla Rashid quits electoral politics in Kashmir | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Six months after her foray into mainstream politics, former JNU student leader Shehla Rashid announced on Wednesday she is quitting electoral politics in Kashmir following the move to hold block development council elections, saying she can’t be a party to the exercise of legitimising “suppression” of people. Rashid, who became a prominent face of student activism following a controversy over a 2016 event at JNU during which alleged anti- national slogans were raised, had earlier this year joined Jammu and Kashmir People’s Movement floated by former IAS officer Shah Faisal. The former JNUSU vice president said she was compelled to dissociate “with the electoral mainstream in Kashmir” due to the move to hold BDC elections later this month, which she termed a “sham electoral exercise”.

"In Haryana, Amit Shah trains guns at Congress over Article 370 | Chandigarh News - Times of India","KAITHAL/ROHTAK: Union home minister and BJP national president Amit Shah bolstered his party’s campaign for the Haryana assembly elections during a rally at Kaithal by attacking the Congress and counting PM Narendra Modi government’s achievements, including the abrogation of articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. He also took on outgoing Kaithal MLA Randeep Singh Surjewala, who is the Congress communication and media wing in-charge. Attacking Surjewala, Shah said, “When Prime Minister Modi takes any initiative for the development of nation, Surjewala gets a stomach ache. He even opposed the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Voters will teach a lesson to Surjewala, who raised questions on the surgical strike by the Indian armed forces, revocation of Article 370 and action against terrorists and illegal immigrants. The Congress top brass should make it clear whether it is in support of abrogation of Article 370 or against it.” Flaying the Congress, he said election campaigning had started in Haryana, but the old grand party looked shattered everywhere. “Congress leaders are confused from which direction they should start their rallies,” Shah said. He also hit out at criticism over defence minister Rajnath Singh performing a “shastra pooja” on a newly acquired Rafale fighter jet in France on Tuesday. “Should the ‘shastra pujan’ tradition be observed or not? Should we keep this tradition alive or not,” he asked the gathering. Shah claimed that Congress leaders were upset over the ceremony performed by Rajnath. Shah said no previous government had dared to scrap J&K’s special status, but the Modi government acted in the first session of Parliament after coming back to power. “We expected to get support from all parties because it was not the BJP’s job, but related to the country's security,” he said, while singling out the Congress He said several soldiers from Haryana had sacrificed their lives over J&K. Contrasting the BJP’s stand with that of the Congress, Shah said former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee had praised Indira Gandhi over the war against Pakistan that brought Bangladesh into being. He said it was because it was a matter of national interest and not a Congress victory. Shah also mentioned the Balakot air strikes and the surgical strike, saying the government had sent a strong message to Pakistan. The Union home minister said Modi had undertaken fewer foreign visits than former PM Manmohan Singh, but the perception was the opposite. He said this was because Singh’s visits failed to make an impact. Shah attacked the previous state governments led by Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Indian National Lok Dal’s Om Prakash Chautala, accusing them of playing caste politics. He alleged that ‘goondaism’ and ‘corruption’ increased during their terms. He praised the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government in Haryana, saying it was corruption-free.

" Aversion to BDC election exposes 'hollowness' of Congress, NC, PDP: BJP | India News - Times of India","JAMMU: The Jammu and Kashmir BJP on Wednesday slammed the Congress, the PDP and the NC for not contesting the first-ever Block Development Council (BDC) polls being held in the state on October 24. A notification was issued on Tuesday for the election of chairpersons of BDC in 310 blocks of Jammu and Kashmir, the first polls in the state after abrogation of its special status on August 5. The Congress has decided to boycott the election, the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will not any candidates. State spokesperson of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Brig (Retd) Anil Gupta said the ""hollowness"" of the three parties had been exposed and they were unable to digest the effort made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to strengthen democracy in the state. ""The power-brokers who have always put their political interests above the interest of the common man and kept him disempowered are now scared of the emergence of new faces and new leadership in the form of Chairmen of BDCs,"" Gupta said. ""These Chairmen will fill the political vacuum created due to the current leadership being obdurate,"" Gupta said, adding Panchs and Sarpanchs duly empowered would provide the grass root leadership and work for the betterment of people. He said Panchayati Raj Institutions are inseparable part of our democratic system and are meant to compliment the system and not act as a parallel centre of power. ""This reality needs to be accepted by the NC and the PDP as much as they need to accept the reality of abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A. They need to reorient in order to remain relevant as mainstream political parties,” Gupta said. Claiming that the Congress, the NC and the PDP have lost ""complete contact"" with the ground level workers, Gupta alleged that the parties had got so used to ""drawing-room politics"" that they have completely ignored grass root workers. ""With the process of conducting elections for the BDC underway, the hollowness from which the main political parties of the state suffer has been exposed,"" he said, adding ""disillusioned and leaderless, their cadre has gone into hibernation."" He said as far as the NC and the PDP is concerned, their leadership was never sincere about devolution of power to the lower rung. ""They were always scared of the seat of power shifting from Gupkar Road to grassroots leaders at Panchayat and block level. The new power structure in the form of Panchayati Raj was always viewed by them as a challenge to their dynastic politics,"" he said.

Xi will attend the second   informal meeting   with Modi at Mamallapuram near Chennai from October 11 to 12 and pay a state visit to Nepal on October 13, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Wednesday. China snubs Imran Khan, says resolve J&amp;K bilaterallyThis is the 2nd informal summit between Modi and Xi. The first one was held last year at the Chinese city of Wuhan, which enabled the two countries to normalise the relations on all fronts after the 73-day standoff between the two militaries at Doklam in 2017. The standoff took place over the Chinese military's plan to build a road close to the narrow Siliguri corridor also known as Chicken Neck corridor connecting the northeastern states. The standoff ended with both sides withdrawing from the standoff site after the Chinese military called off its road building plans. The Wednesday's announcement about Xi's visit to India by China, coincides with the ongoing visit of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and its Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa. Khan who arrived on Tuesday held talks with Premier Li Keqiang and expected to meet Xi on Wednesday.

Malik directed the state home department on Monday to withdraw the advisory issued in August asking tourists to leave the Valley, and that tourists are welcome from October 10.

Amit Shah launches Maharashtra election campaign with poser on Article 370 | Aurangabad News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday launched the BJP’s campaign for the Maharashtra assembly elections from Savargaon Ghat village, the birthplace of 20th century saint Bhagwan Baba in Beed district, with a poser on Article 370 and 35A. “Was the move to abrogate Articles 370 and 35 correct,” asked the minister while addressing a mammoth Dasara rally, attended mainly by the OBCs from across the state. Shah said people should take the message of nationalism to every household, indicating that the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A, ending Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, will be the BJP’s key poll plank in the current elections. The BJP president said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had removed these Articles to unite the country and exhorted the gathering to question those who are still opposing the Modi government’s J&K move. In his brief address, which lasted for about seven minutes, Shah said the country was making progress at a tremendous pace under the Modi regime. He said it was his first public meeting after the announcement of the state assembly elections in Maharashtra and that he would refrain from making political statements and speak at public meetings later. Without elaborating much, Shah claimed that for the first time in 70 years, the OBCs have got Constitutional recognition. He insisted that the Modi government has been doing a lot for the upliftment of the OBCs and ‘vanchit’ (oppressed) people. The minister was given a 370-gun salute and the organisers also displayed 370 national flags at the venue to show appreciation for the government’s move to abrogate Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution. Pankaja Munde, following in the footsteps of her father Gopinath Munde, organised the event at the Savargaon Ghat village of Patoda taluka in Beed. It was also a show of strength for her. Meanwhile, PM Modi and Amit Shah are scheduled to address two campaign meetings each in the Marathwada region. Party general secretary Surjeet Singh Thakur told TOI that Shah would address two meetings in Tuljapur and Ausa on October 10, while Modi would campaign for party nominees in Partur and Parli. In Tuljapur, BJP has fielded Rana Jagjitsinh Patil, a close relative of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, against Congress veteran Madhukar Chavan. Meanwhile, in Ausa, the party has fielded Abhimanyu Pawar, the chief minister’s personal assistant, who is facing a tough challenge in the wake of strong opposition from many senior BJP and Sena activists, who consider him an outsider. The PM will make it to Partur on October 16, where Babanrao Lonikar, a minister in the Fadnavis cabinet, is the BJP nominee. On October 17, he will address a rally in Parli, where Pankaja is facing a stiff challenge from her cousin, Dhananjay Munde, the opposition leader in the legislative council.

 US Congress ups pressure to end blockage in Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: US Congressional pressure is increasing on India with regards to the situation in Kashmir Valley even as New Delhi is signaling that it is easing restrictions while maintaining that its priority is to prevent violence and loss of life even if it means provisional curtailment of civil liberties in some areas. Two prominent Democratic Senators and the House Foreign Relations Committee have expressed disquiet over the past 24 hours at the slow pace of normalization while implicitly accepting constitutional changes New Delhi has effected to mainstream the erstwhile state where a few districts are sporadically wracked by separatist violence and terrorism. The criticism, stemming from constituent pressure and lobbying by Pakistanis, Kashmiri expats and human rights activists, has been respectful of New Delhi’s position, and generally in line with the position of the US government, which has also urged a speedy return to normalcy while not opposing India’s move to end special status for Kashmir. Democratic Senators who expressed concern about the situation included Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Virginia Senator Mark Warner. The Democrat-led House Foreign Relations Committee has also pitched in, saying in a tweet on Monday that “India’s communication blackout in Kashmir is having a devastating impact on the lives and welfare of everyday Kashmiris,” and it’s “time for India to lift these restrictions and afford Kashmiris the same rights and privileges as any other Indian citizen.” The committee’s statement seeking normalization while implicitly recognizing the validity of New Delhi’s move generated pushback from India partisans who pointed out that abrogating Article 370 was aimed at giving Kashmiris the same rights and privileges as any other Indian citizen. Similar pushback followed a tweet by Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren who prefaced her statement saying “The US-India partnership has always been rooted in our shared democratic values,” while expressing concern about recent events in Kashmir, including a continued communications blackout and other restrictions. The rights of the people of Kashmir must be respected, she added. When Warren followed it up with a separate tweet about gun violence in the U.S (following another mass shooting in Kansas) and the need for action to end gun violence, she was reminded by pro-India activists that she should allow New Delhi to take steps to curb violence and terrorism even if it meant provisional curtailment of communications, which was in any case restricted to a few districts in the Valley. “J&K is a diverse area with many religions, backgrounds, classes. India and the region can’t allow Taliban and similar groups to terrorize Kashmiris,” she was told by one critic. Indian officials have been making their case along these lines in meetings with lawmakers. Several US lawmakers, while expressing concern about the communications blockage in the Valley, have indicated that as long as India normalizes the situation quickly, they have no problem with New Delhi’s effort to change the status quo. “While I understand India has legitimate security concerns, I am disturbed by its restrictions on communications and movement within Jammu and Kashmir. I hope India will live up to its democratic principles by allowing freedom of press, information, and political participation,” Virginia Senator Mark Warner tweeted. US lawmaker concerns are typically driven by pressure from constituents. Pakistan has mounted a concerted effort to press lawmakers using not only its expat community but also drafting disaffected Kashmiris and malingering Sikh separatists to its cause, even as India is pushing back through offshore nationalists with its own version of events. So while Pakistan partisans are advertising the fact that House Foreign Relations SubCommittee on South Asia has scheduled a “hearing on Kashmir” on October 22 and are hoping to put India on the mat on the occasion, Indian activists are pointing out that the hearing is on “Human Rights in South Asia,” and aside from the focus on the situation in Kashmir Valley, the committee has also said in a September 20 statement that the “hearing will also focus on the Tamils of Sri Lanka, the human rights situation in Pakistan, including the Sindh Province and Muslims in Assam. In fact, Indian activists, seeking scrutiny of the human rights situation in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK), Gilgit-Baltistan, Balochistan, and Sindh, are also pressing for witness testimony from these regions, in addition to having from Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist representatives from Jammu and Kashmir testify at the hearing.

The witness list has not been announced so far, but the principal witness is likely to be Alice Wells, the State Department's point-person for South Asia.

" China calls Kashmir bilateral issue, drops UN references | India News - Times of India","BEIJING: As Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for talks with Xi Jinping ahead of the Chinese President's important visit to India, China said the Kashmir issue should be resolved between New Delhi and Islamabad, significantly omitting its recent references to the UN and UN Security Council resolutions. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang during his media briefing here on Tuesday did not make any official announcement about Xi's visit to India. However, Chinese officials informally said an announcement would be made simultaneously in Beijing and New Delhi on Wednesday. The foreign ministry has also called for a special media briefing on Wednesday on ""Chinese leader's outbound visit"". ""India and China have a tradition of high-level exchanges. Both sides have communication exchange over high-level visit. Any new information will be released soon,"" Geng said in response to questions on Xi's visit to India. Both India and China are major developing countries of the world and major emerging markets, he said. ""Since the Wuhan informal summit (last year), our bilateral relations have gathered good momentum,"" he said. ""We have been advancing our cooperation and properly managing our differences. We have a tradition of high level exchange and our two sides are maintaining communication on high level exchange in the next phase. We should make good atmosphere and environment for this,"" he said. When asked about Khan's visit to Beijing ahead of Xi's trip to India and whether the Kashmir issue will figure in his talks with the Chinese leaders, Geng said that China's stand is that the Kashmir issue should be resolved between India and Pakistan. ""And so you are paying attention to the Kashmir issue, right? China's position on Kashmir issue is clear and consistent”, he said. ""We call on India and Pakistan to engage in dialogue and consultation on all issues including Kashmir issue and consolidate mutual trust. This is in line with interest of both countries and common aspiration of the world,"" he said. His comments marked a significant shift on what China has been saying on Kashmir in recent weeks in the aftermath of India's move to revoke Article 370 of the Constitution removing the special status to Kashmir. In its first reaction on August 6, the Chinese foreign ministry issued two separate statements. In one statement, China also expressed its opposition to India's move to create a separate Union Territory of Ladakh highlighting Beijing's territorial claims in the area. The second statement said, ""We call on both India and Pakistan to peacefully resolve the relevant disputes through dialogue and consultation and safeguard peace and stability in the region"". But, China added UN and UNSC resolutions on Kashmir when Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi visited Beijing few days later and met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. ""It (Kashmir issue) should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreement,"" Wang had said. A closed-door meeting of the UNSC on Kashmir where China maintained the same stand ended without any outcome or statement, in a snub to Beijing and Islamabad. Later, Wang in his UN General Assembly speech mentioned the same which drew protests from India. Geng's comments on Tuesday marks China's return to its original stand that Kashmir issue should be resolved bilaterally. Observers say it is significant shift ahead of Xi's visit to India for his 2nd informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On Khan's visit, Geng said China attaches ""great importance"" to his trip. Khan arrived here on a two-day official visit to China during which he would meet the country's top leadership including President Xi and discuss issues of regional and bilateral significance. Significantly, Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa arrived here ahead of Khan on Monday night, according to the Pakistan army's media wing - the Inter-Services Public Relations ISPR). Gen Bajwa would also attend Khan's key meetings with Xi and Premier Li Keqiang, highlighting his powerful position in Pakistan's power structure. ""COAS arrived China on official visit. COAS will meet Chinese mil leadership including PLA Army Commander, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission & Commander Southern Theater Command. COAS will also join PM for meeting with Chinese PM and President,"" the ISPR tweeted. Their visits came ahead of Xi's planned visit to India. ""China and Pakistan are all weather strategic cooperation partners. We have good tradition of close exchange and communication. We have strategic mutual trust and advancing practical cooperation. Our cooperation in CPEC is bringing more outcomes to our peoples,"" he said. Geng, however, did not respond to question about General Bajwa's visit.

US Congress committee urges India to end communication blackout in Kashmir - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: India's communication blackout is having a ""devastating impact"" on the lives and welfare of the people of Kashmir, a powerful US Congressional Committee has said, urging New Delhi to lift its more than two-month long restrictions in the Valley. Restrictions were first imposed across Kashmir on August 5 when the Centre announced its decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Normal life has remained affected in Kashmir for over months as main markets continue to be shut and public transport off the roads. Mobile services remain suspended in Kashmir except in Handwara and Kupwara areas in the north, while Internet services - across all platforms continued to be snapped in the Valley since August 5. ""India's communication blackout in Kashmir is having a devastating impact on the lives and welfare of everyday Kashmiris,"" House Foreign Affairs Committee said in a tweet on Monday. ""Its time for India to lift these restrictions and afford Kashmiris the same rights and privileges as any other Indian citizen,"" it said. The House committee comes nearly a month after Indian-American lawmaker Pramila Jayapal, along with 13 other US Congressmen, urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address concerns over the human rights situation in Kashmir and lift the communications blackout. The Asia-Pacific and Non-Proliferation Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee has scheduled a hearing on human rights in Kashmir and other parts of South Asia on October 22. On August 5, India revoked Article 370 of the Constitution removing special status to Jammu and Kashmir, evoking sharp response from Pakistan. Pakistan expelled the Indian High Commissioner soon after deciding to downgrade diplomatic ties with New Delhi.  India has categorically told the international community that its move to scrap Article 370 of the Constitution was an internal matter and has also advised Pakistan to accept the reality.

""The Modi-led government, which came to power with a thumping majority, revoked Article 370 in just three months of winning the elections (held earlier this year). Now, people should ask the opposition why they were unable to revoke Article 370,"" Shah said. The BJP-led central government has been undertaking several developmental projects, he added. The Dussehra function in Beed was organised by state Cabinet minister Pankaja Munde. She organised a special welcome for Shah with the firing of 370 canons in air and waving of 370 flags, to appreciate the Centre's decision to abrogate the Article which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Munde said the abrogation of Article 370 united the country. Addressing the gathering, she further said, ""The people present here have to take sickle in their hands to harvest sugarcane and earn their bread and butter.

Addressing the Vijayadashmi function of the RSS at Reshimbagh ground in Maharashtra's Nagpur city, he said the word 'lynching' does not originate from Indian ethos but comes from a separate religious text, and such terms should not be imposed on Indians.

Ramlila in Agra to celebrate abrogationof Article 370 &amp; Chandrayaan 2 mission | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: This Dussehra, people of Agra will be treated to a unique spectacle. Ramlila will not just conclude with the epic ritual of setting Ravan into flames but will be followed by a special display of fireworks celebrating the country’s recent landmark events such as abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and Chandrayaan 2 mission. Divulging the details on the eve of Dussehra, Shri Ramlila committee spokesperson, Rahul Gautam, said, “The re-enactment of the epic battle between lord Ram and Ravan will start at 7:30 pm. The giant effigy of Ravan will be set on fire at 10 pm. Then, a massive show of colourful fireworks will start and continue until midnight. These celebratory fireworks will mark the recent events of abrogation of Article 370 in J&K and Chandrayaan 2 mission. Various other highlights such as plastic ban, Swachh Bharat Mission and water conservation have been added this year.” And the people can hardly wait for the 110 feet tall effigy of Ravan to be put into flames at the Ramlila ground in front of the historic Agra fort marking the symbolic triumph of good over evil. Three to five feet of readymade effigies of Ravan fitted with firecrackers are available in the market - all in high demand. On Monday, people got a taste of what to expect with the burning of a 90 feet tall effigy of Ravan’s warrior son Meghanad. Communal harmony is also a key highlight here. Effigies of Ravan, Meghanad and Kumbhakarn have been prepared by Muslim artisans. Sameer Ali and his family - residents of Mathura - are contributing with their creative efforts to make the effigies for four generations. In fact, members of the Ramlila organising committee said that the event would remain incomplete without contribution of Sameer Ali, his uncle Zafar Ali and other family members. Septuagenarian Zafar Ali told TOI, “We have been preparing effigies for the main event on the occasion of Dussehra for the past one month. Ravan’s effigy this year will be 110 feet tall, 10 feet more than last year. We will be using a crane to install it. After completion of art work on the effigies, my friend Chaman Mansoori will add the firecrackers. We are going to put up an attractive show for spectators.” Mansoori, along with his team, has been working on the fireworks show for more than a decade. Mansoori told TOI, “We are going to dedicate this year’s fireworks to the abrogation of Article 370 and mission Chandrayaan 2. We have planned a special display of fireworks relating to recent developments in national interest.” Ramlila is a dramatic folk re-enactment of lord Ram’s life culminating in a 10-day battle between Ram and Ravan as described by the epic ‘Ramayana’. Every year, effigies of evil characters of ‘Ramayana’ are set into flames. The Ramlila in Agra is one of the most prestigious events of its kind in north India, Gautam said, adding that it has several key messages such as communal harmony and environment.

The governor directed withdrawal of the advisory with effect from October 10. The advisory was issued on August 2, days before the issuance of the presidential order revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, negating the Article 370 of the Constitution. Malik issued the directive for lifting the security advisory for tourists at a ""situation-cum-security review' meeting with the advisors and the chief secretary here, an official spokesman said. He said the governor was also informed that as Block Development Council (BDC) elections, scheduled to be held on October 24, are party-based, the delegations of parties having their leaders in jail are being allowed to meet party presidents once so that they can take decision on elections and authorise someone to approve candidates. Kashmir situation normal, people happy with Article 370 abrogation: Prakash JavadekarThe governor directed that the Home Department's advisory asking tourists to leave the valley be lifted immediately.

" Silent on Article 370, is National Conference softening towards Delhi? | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: The intriguing silence of National Conference on the nullification of Articles 370 and 35A on Sunday, when a 15-member delegation of party leaders was allowed to meet their bosses for the first time in two months since Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar were detained, seems to be part of a well thought out strategy, if party insiders are to be believed. In what could well be an indication of going soft towards the Centre on the contentious provisions which are now defunct, NC sources told TOI on Monday that the party would “rather focus on pressing for restoring statehood to Jammu and Kashmir”. It may be noted that while NC members deliberately chose not to talk about the withdrawal of special status to J&K after they met the party bosses on Sunday, they focused on their twin demands for the release of all detained political leaders, including the Abdullahs, and the “lifting of lockdown” in Kashmir. Farooq Abdullah demands unconditional release of all detainees for political process to begin in J&amp;KThe meeting of NC members with party leaders was allowed by the Satya Pal Malik administration as a step towards restoring political activity in the state. Lok Sabha MP Hasnain Masoodi told mediapersons on Sunday after the two meetings (with Omar at Hari Niwas and Farooq at Gupkar Road) that both father and son were “in good spirits”. A political analyst said on condition of anonymity that the statements by NC leaders, coupled with the pictures of a beaming Farooq with a victory sign, flanked by wife Molly and MPs Mohammad Akbar Lone and Masoodi, were a sure sign of softening of NC’s stand towards the Centre.

PDP had announced on Sunday that a delegation led by party general secretary Ved Mahajan would meet Mehbooba on Monday. However, the party announced late Sunday night that the meeting was cancelled. On Monday, PDP member Firdous Tak said the meeting was cancelled due to differences within the party. It was decided not to meet Mehbooba “till there is consensus”, he added. Tak’s clarification came even as party general secretary Surinder Choudhry emphasised that PDP was not “NC’s B-team to follow in its footsteps”.

Barkatullah University to hold special PhD test for Kashmiri students | Bhopal News - Times of India,"BHOPAL: Barkatullah University will hold a special PhD entrance test for Kashmiri students, who could not appear in the exam due to the aftermath of the scrapping of Article 370.  Around 60 Kashmiri students get into BU for PhD every year, but not a single one could make it to exam day on August 21 due to restrictions imposed in the Valley. The Union government abolished Article 370 on August 5, and BU issued the notification for the PhD test the next day. With internet and phones down in Kashmir, many students could not get information on time. Several Kashmiris, who were already studying in Bhopal, filed their applications, but rushed back home out of concern for their families. They, too, missed the entrance test as they couldn't return. BU went ahead with the test on schedule for 1,700 PhD seats. Realising that these students may lose an entire year, the BU administration on Monday decided to give them a second chance. Only those who have already applied will be allowed, said an official. BU vice-chancellor Prof R J Rao told TOI that university does not want any student to lose out.

An NC spokesman said the party president also told the delegation that the people of the state have voiced their disapproval over the revocation of the special status and bifurcation of the state by protesting in a peaceful manner and the party cannot ignore these sentiments. A 15-member NC delegation were on Sunday allowed to meet Farooq Abdullah and party vice president Omar Abdullah for the first time since their detention.

 Colonial role of police not in sync with today’s reality: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Monday said the colonial role of police as an agent of fear was not in sync with today’s reality and should be replaced in ‘New India’ by a work ethic that requires police to practice “minimum use of force with maximum effectiveness”. Addressing IPS probationers of the 2018 batch here, Shah insisted that IPS as an institution must ensure that a positive behavioural change in the police percolates to the grassroots. He said that in the Prime Minister’s vision of a ‘New India’, there is a need for the police personnel to incorporate a human touch and sensitivity in their dealings with the people. Shah called for a conceptual change in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), saying the amended codes must be in line with India being a welfare state rather than their original purpose of preservation of the British Empire. Addressing the young IPS officers, Shah encouraged them to focus on discharging their official duties honestly and making a positive contribution to betterment of the society. Shah said reforming the system does not mean shunning the traditional ways of policing. Rather, he added, it was a continuous process of adaptation of the old methods to address new challenges. He noted that the challenges faced by societies change, and so should the responses to them, from laws to technology. “Maintenance of peace and stability is very important to achieve PM, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of a $5 trillion economy,” he was quoted as saying. Speaking on taking tough yet right decisions, Shah asserted that some bold decisions must be made for people’s benefit without getting bogged down by the fear of a backlash. He quoted the example of Jammu and Kashmir and said that not a single bullet had been fired or not a single person killed after the abrogation of Article 370. On the need for a National Register of Citizens (NRC), he said NRC not be seen as a political exercise but a Constitutional one, as it is very important to have a national citizen register in order to ensure that benefits of development reach all our citizens. Shah told the probationers that as IPS officers, their job is to ensure that there is freedom to take required decisions while owning up of responsibility at all levels, without overstepping of boundaries. He urged the young officers to build capacity of constables. The minister said lady IPS officers could inspire other women to join the police, while adding that a gradual change in the societal mindset and not gender-based reservation was the solution to inadequate representation of women in the police.

 PDP leader lashes out at party colleagues | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Differences in the PDP over the issue of a party delegation meeting its detained president Mehbooba Mufti in Srinagar came out in the open on Monday with a senior leader alleging that those involved in the decision did not take on board the leadership in Jammu. PDP general secretary and former legislator Surinder Choudhary alleged that some ""land grabbers and land mafia"" within the party have taken the decision on the meeting. Within hours of announcing that a team of party leaders from Jammu led by general secretary Ved Mahajan will meet Mehbooba in Srinagar on Monday following permission from administration, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) late on Sunday said it has decided to defer the scheduled meeting but gave no reason. Sources within the party, however, had said that the had visit was deferred because of lack of unanimity on the composition of the delegation. ""They are not the well wishers of the party and have in fact destroyed its base in Jammu,"" Choudhary told reporters. Mehbooba is under detention since August 5, the day the Centre abrogated Article 370 provisions of the Constitution and announced bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories. The PDP's announcement that it has been permitted to meet Mehbooba had come on a day when a 15-member delegation of the National Conference from Jammu met their party president Farooq Abdullah and vice president Omar Abdullah in Srinagar, for the first time since their detention. ""I do not know where the (PDP) meeting took place and who took this decision (sending a delegation to meet Mehbooba). ""I visited Kashmir twice after the abrogation of Article 370 to meet Mehbooba but was denied permission by local authorities,"" Choudhary said. He said PDP is not the National Conference's 'B team' to follow its footsteps. ""Why no meeting was convened to discuss the prevailing situation post abrogation of Article 370.? Kashmir is shut, people in Ladakh are not satisfied and Jammu region has its own grievances after facing discrimination over the past 70 years,"" he said. He also questioned the timing of the meeting. ""How did they ignore these festivals to plan a visit of the delegation to Srinagar?"" he asked. ""Those who have taken this decision are in fact land grabbers and land mafia who have destroyed the party in Jammu and do not even guarantee vote of their own spouses to the party,"" he alleged. ""What stopped them from visiting the party president... they are basically afraid (of action by the state administration) because of their misdeeds,"" he said.

General (retd) Musharraf, now based in Dubai, also referred to Kargil conflict, and alleged that India was repeatedly threatening Pakistan despite Islamabad's peace overtures. ""Perhaps, the Indian Army has forgotten the Kargil war,"" he said, claiming that India had to seek the US president's help in ending the conflict in 1999. The 76-year-old All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) Chairman made the remarks while addressing party workers on the APML's founding day in Islamabad via telephone from Dubai on Sunday. He took a break from political activities last year because of his deteriorating health. Kashmir is in the blood of Pakistani nation, the former president said, in probably his first public comments since the worsening of relations between India and Pakistan after the Indian government revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5. ""We will continue to stand by our Kashmiri brethren no matter what,"" he said, adding that the Pakistani nation and Pakistan Army will fight till the last drop of their blood,"" Musharraf was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune. He said that Pakistan's desire for peace should not be seen as weakness, adding, the Pakistan armed forces are ready to give a ""befitting response to any Indian misadventure."" Tension between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5. Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner. India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". India has also asked Pakistan to accept the reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric. Musharraf also criticised Indian politicians and military commanders for ramping up tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours with their ""irresponsible statements."" Musharraf has been living in Dubai since March 2016 and is facing the treason case for suspending the Constitution in 2007, a punishable offence for which he was indicted in 2014.

Although party sources said the number of rallies may change depending on the need of the campaign, they confirmed that the two leaders will campaign rigorously with national issues like nullification of Article 370, Modi government's anti-corruption drive and the saffron push for nationwide NRC being the top planks. Sources said the feedback received on government’s decision to end Jammu & Kashmir’s special status was encouraging and people also looked “favourably” at its push for action against big names, many of them opposition leaders, allegedly involved in corruption. By giving saffron campaign an overarching theme powered by national issues, BJP hopes to come back to power with a bigger mandate. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Priyanka Gandhi looks for house in Lucknow | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Oct 6, 2019)NEW DELHI: Congress’ UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi is unhappy over recent actions by some leaders going against the party line. She has asked the party officials to take strict action against such leaders. This came after Congress MLA from Rae Bareli Aditi Singh attended the special assembly session called by UP government on October 2. In the past, Aditi Singh had also spoken in support of withdrawal of Article 370 . Sources in Congress tell ET that a show cause notice to Aditi Singh has been issued at the instance of Priyanka Gandhi. Congress workers also protested in front of Aditi’s house in Rare Bareli on Friday. According to party sources, they were well aware of Aditi Singh’s getting closer to the BJP. That’s why while deciding for the faces in the new PCC team, her name was not considered. The party is yet to announced the new PCC. However when her father and former MLA Akhilesh Singh passed away in August, Priyanka Gandhi visited native house of Aditi Singh in Rae Bareli. Post Lok Sabha elections, two Yadav leaders who had contested on Congress ticket left the party. Bhalchandra Yadav, who died last week had contested on Congress ticket from Sant Kabir Nagar. Yadav has moved to BSP post elections. Another leader Ramakant Yadav too has joined Congress during Lok Sabha elections and contested from Bhadohi. Last week after knowing that he would join SP, Congress expelled from the party. Yadav on Sunday joined SP in Lucknow. Priyanka has now given instructions that party would focus on getting new people in politics rather than leaders from other parties joining the party. The message is for the ideological expansion of the party rather than anyone who joins the party for their vested interests. She is also planning to devote more time in state and personally lead from the front before 2022 assembly elections. For that currently house hunting is going on in Lucknow for her. One of the possible houses is Indira Gandhi’s maternal aunt Sheila Kaul’s bungalow on Gokhale Marg in Lucknow. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" Jaish's new poster boy in PoK: Informer-turned-terror kingpin, Nengroo | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Lure of big money turned Aashiq Ahmed Nengroo, a truck driver from Pulwama, from a police informer to a terror kingpin. Once seen as a pro-Indian Kashmiri, Negroo, succumbed to the lust for money and finally became one of the largest 'exporter' of arms, narcotics and terrorists into the Indian territory. After the recent drone droppings in Punjab, Indian security agencies have launched a massive manhunt in the Kashmir Valley to nab more than 40 terrorists despatched by Nengroo, the new poster boy of Jaish-e-Mohammed, the Pakistan-based terror outfit, desperate to escalate it's anti-Indian operations. The well-trained terrorists infiltrated through the international border in Jammu and Kashmir by Nengroo, also includes a few small groups of fidayeens. With the connivance of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan, Nengroo orchestrated the sensational arms dropping case in which drones were used to smuggle lethal weapons into India from across the border, last month. Once an informer for the Indian Army, Nengroo had helped security agencies by providing tip-offs about some of the dreaded terrorists who were killed in encounters. As a driver, hailing from Kakapora area (Pulwama) located 12 km away from Srinagar, Nengroo had built a strong network among the separatist leaders and anti-Indian rogues. Due to this network Nengroo had a deep insight into the terror activities centred in and around Srinagar, reveals the dossier prepared by Intelligence agencies on him. However, lure of money turned Nengroo into a sympathiser of th separatists. The dossier says that Nengroo later came into contact of a Hijbul Mujahideen leader, who subsequently assigned him to organise stone pelting incidents in Pulwama, a hub of stone pelters in the valley. For every anti-Indian assignment, Nengroo fetched a couple of thousand rupees. Eyeing such lucrative assignments Nengroo left Hijbul and became ISI's key player in the Valley. Getting handsome funds from his handlers, he bought a few trucks and got involved in smuggling of weapons and also helped terror outfits in transportation of terrorists. Finally he joined the Jaish and sneaked into Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. The intel dossier also reveals that Nengroo's brother, Mohammed Abbas was a Jaish terrorist and was killed in a police encounter, a few years ago. His other brother, Riyaz also joined the Jaish and was arrested last year on charges of transporting three terrorists from Jammu to Srinagar in September 2018. Sources in the Jammu and Kashmir Police revealed that in a bid to execute a series of terror attacks, after the abrogation of Article 370, Nengroo had planned to smuggle weapons into the valley. However on September 12, a truck bearing number JK3E 2000 was intercepted by security agencies at Lakhanpur, on the Punjab-Jammu and Kashmir border. Four AK 56 and two AK 47 rifles were recovered from the truck. Sources said that after the recovery of these weapons, agencies unearthed a vicious terror plan of the ISI to be executed by a Jaish module at the behest of Nengroo. At present, National Investigation Agency, in coordination with Punjab and J&K Police is investigating this case. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" Kashmir situation normal, people happy with Article 370 abrogation: Prakash Javadekar | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The situation in Jammu and Kashmir is ""normal"" and the people there are ""happy"" over the abrogation of Article 370 provisions as they will now get benefits and entitlements on par with citizens of rest of the country, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar has said. He also asserted that there have been no restrictions on media and that all newspapers are being published in the Valley without any difficulty. The minister also rejected the opposition's charge that the BJP was using withdrawal of Jammu and Kashmir's special status as a poll plank in the run-up to assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra, saying it was the people who were talking about the historic move as it caught their imagination. Terrorism will be eliminated from J&amp;K with removal of Article 370: Amit Shah""Article 370 has caught the imagination of people. The people are welcoming it all over the country. So what can you do, all sections of the society (have welcomed it),"" he said. Asked about the situation in Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370 provisions, he said the situation remains ""good"" and it is ""normal"". ""People in the Valley are supporting the government's move...They are welcoming the move because it will benefit them,"" he said. Javadekar said people in Jammu and Kashmir will now get benefits of all the government schemes which were not available them prior to abrogation of the Article 370. Under Jammu and Kashmir's special status, the state had the right to its own decision-making process for several key subjects except very few including defence, communications and foreign affairs. Various central laws were not applicable to the state. ""Under Right to Education, 25 per cent students from economically weaker sections get admission. It was not applicable to J and K, but now it will be applicable,"" he said. People of Jammu and Kashmir did not get benefits under various schemes for OBCs (other backward class), but they will get it now. Similarly, people from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes had no political reservation but they will get it now, Javadekar said. ""The home minister gave a list of 126 laws that did not apply in Kashmir but are now all applicable there. People are getting benefit out of it and therefore they are happy. All the central schemes are now operational in the Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Ladakh,"" he said. He said that Pakistan was able to fuel separatism in the last 50-60 years in Jammu and Kashmir because of the Article 370. ""It was due to this provision that separatism and terrorism increased. Now both are over,"" he added. The I&B minister also asserted that there are no restrictions on the media in the state and journalists are free to visit the region and see the situation for themselves. He dismissed criticism by a section of the international media over alleged rights violations in Kashmir. ""The country's media has to put out the truth,"" he said, adding criticism by Indian media matters. He also rejected suggestions that children were not attending schools, asserting that students were present in both government and private schools. ""Only in eight police station areas, you have (section) 144, otherwise there is nothing. These are the first two months when there have been no incidents of firing and there was no casualty or death of civilians,"" Javadekar said. On concerns over media freedom in Kashmir, he said media freedom in India was attacked only once during the Emergency. ""We were angry. The whole nation fought for it. Then the press freedom came in its original form only because of our fight. We were in jail for 16 months for press, organisational and speech freedom. As far as Kashmir is concerned there is no case like that,"" he asserted. ""Kashmir is open to all (TV news) channels, all newspapers ...They are going to all the places. Only (areas under) eight police stations have Section 144 (of the CrPC). Otherwise, there are no restrictions. Every communication is working. All news papers are published everyday,"" the I&B minister said. He said the only issue was of mobile connectivity for which he cited Supreme Court's observation that national security precedes everything. Asked whether there is any timeline for release of political detainees in Kashmir, he did not give a direct reply. ""The Home Minister keeps informing us."" On August 5, the Centre announced the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 and the bifurcation of the state into two union territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

 Assembly polls: National issues to figure prominently in BJP campaign pitch | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: As the BJP gives final shape to campaign blitzkrieg by its top guns in Maharashtra and Haryana post Dussehra, party leaders said national issues like nullification of Article 370, Modi government's ""anti-corruption"" drive and the saffron push for nation-wide NRC will be among their top planks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi may address around 10 rallies in Maharashtra and four to five in Haryana while BJP president and Home Minister Amit Shah is likely to speak at twice these numbers of public meetings in the two states heading to assembly polls on October 21. These numbers are provisional and may change depending on the needs of campaign, a party leader said. BJP sources said the feedback received by the party on the Union government's decision to end Jammu and Kashmir special status is very encouraging and people also look ""favourably"" at its push for action against big names, many of them opposition leaders, allegedly involved in corruption. The Opposition has termed the action as ""political vendetta"". A BJP leader said opposition parties like the Congress are completely ""defensive"" on these matters, noting that many of its leaders even backed the government's decision on Article 370 despite their party leadership's stand against it due to popular support to the move. Top BJP brass including Modi and Shah have exuded confidence about the party retaining power in both the states. The party believes that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his Maharashtra counterpart Devendra Fadnavis enjoy a ""clean"" image and have run ""honest and competent"" dispensations. By giving the saffron campaign an overarching theme powered by national issues, the BJP hopes to come back to power with a bigger mandate. The BJP has set a target of winning over 200 seats in 288-member Maharashtra assembly with its allies, Shiv Sena and some small parties, while 75 on its own in 90-member Haryana assembly. It had won 122 and 47 seats on its own in the two states respectively in 2014. The party believes that a good show in the two states will also help it set the campaign pitch in the Jharkhand and Delhi assembly polls, two states, especially the national capital, where its rivals will work to make the elections about local issues. Despite being seen by political watchers as favourites to retain power in Maharashtra and Haryana, the BJP leadership is making a determined push to maximise its prospects to send out a signal about its political dominance and deny a disjointed opposition any chance to rally around.

Panda's comments come in the wake of Chinese Ambassador to Islamabad Yao Jing reportedly said that Beijing will stand by Pakistan for the resolution of the Kashmir issue.  In August this year, the Central government had abrogated Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into two Union Territories -- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  Speaking on the inclusion of late Squadron Leader Ravi Khanna's name on the National War Memorial, Panda said that it was long overdue and now the martyrs are being recognised.  ""It was long overdue. He was killed by a terrorist who wanted to divide Jammu and Kashmir and spread terror. And someone who has confessed it on the international TV,"" he said.

Security blueprint chalked out for Ayodhya verdict | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW/AYODHYA: Gearing up for the Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhya title suit, the state government has begun preparations to put in place a mammoth security cover around the temple town. To begin with, authorities are identifying campuses of schools and colleges to house additional police and paramilitary forces, which will be mobilized from across the country. Also, security agencies have identified at least 42 entry-exit points around Ayodhya district, which are crucial for crowd management along district borders. Intelligence units have already been activated in neighbouring districts. The security apparatus was activated after chief minister Yogi Adityanath told police brass at a law and order review meet in Lucknow on September 25 to raise vigil in the state before the apex court verdict, expected in November. He ordered police to begin the groundwork at the police station level by holding meetings with different groups and activating intelligence agencies. ‘Shortlisting 50 schools to house forces’He directed cops to keep an eye on those who could use this as an excuse to trigger anarchy after abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Talking to TOI on Saturday, additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said, “We conducted a routine security review of Ayodhya at a meeting chaired by the chief secretary. All security aspects were taken into account, including contingencies.” Sharing details of preparations, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ayodhya Ashish Tewari said final touches were being given to the security blueprint. “Our priority is to arrange proper accommodation of additional forces. We are scouring schools and colleges for housing our forces,” Tewari told TOI. He said additional forces have already been sought. “Mobilisation of forces from outside Ayodhya is likely to begin from first week of November,” he said. Sources said, the administration is shortlisting at least 50 schools to accommodate the forces.

 Some people trying to destroy country's harmonious atmosphere: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi | India News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday said the BJP-led government was focusing on development of all sections of society without any discrimination, but unfortunately some people were trying to ""destroy"" the harmonious atmosphere. However, these people were not getting any support and being 'isolated', he said, without elaborating. The union minister of minority affairs said the Centre was committed to the safety, security and prosperity of every section of society. ""Unfortunately, some people are trying to destroy or disturb our harmonious atmosphere and these people are trying to do all sort of things,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of an event here. To a query whether any special law will be enacted against those who try to disturb communal harmony, he said, ""there is sufficient law to deal with these criminals.."" Asked whether people in Kashmir would be able to apply online for Haj pilgrimage as internet services were yet to be restored, Naqvi said, ""... there is no problem for the Kashmiri people who want to fill their applications."" On the coming Parliament session, Naqvi said ""This time also we are expecting (it to be productive)."" Referring to the resolution moved in the House, in August, to abolish Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, he said the previous session was productive. Earlier at the Grahak Mela-Customer Outreach Initiative by Indian Overseas Bank, Naqvi disbursed sanctioned loans to various beneficiaries.

BJP-Shiv Sena alliance will get over 200 seats in Maharashtra assembly elections: Javadekar | Pune News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Asserting that there was never a ""big brother"" in the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar exuded confidence that the two parties together will win more than 200 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly in the upcoming polls. The BJP is a party which works 24/7 and the moment 2019 elections ended, it started preparing for the next election, the Union minister said in an interaction with journalists at the news agency's headquarters here. ""The Congress party could not find a replacement of its president for two months. Within those two months we had new working president in place, we launched our new massive membership drive and added eight crore members, making it a 19 crore-member party. It is huge,"" he said. ""So, we are working on the ground and our forte is booth. We remain among the people 24/7 for which people reward us,"" he asserted. Asked about opposition's claim that the BJP is raising the abrogation of Article 370 provisions is state polls to divert attention from local issues, Javadekar said it is the people who are talking about the issue as it caught their imagination. He also said the media created the jargon of ""big brother"" in the BJP-Sena combine and asserted that no one in the alliance declared so.

'It'll be an absolute dream': Gautam Gambhir on being Delhi CM | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: As a newly anointed Member of Parliament from East Delhi constituency Gautam Gambhir has his hands full. But the cricketer-turned-politician is not averse to taking on more responsibility -- in case he is called to lead the state of Delhi. ""It will be an honour. A huge responsibility. It will be an absolute dream,"" said the BJP MP from East Delhi on Friday, when asked if he would agree to an arrangement like in Uttar Pradesh, where Yogi Adityanath, then an MP, was asked to take over as the chief minister. For now, Gambhir is mindful of the challenges that his constituency faces, the biggest being the Ghazipur landfill. He has promised to slowly cut down the height of the trash mountain in the area and inaugurated a ballistic segregator on Thursday for the purpose. However, Gambhir is honest enough to admit that cannot give a ""time frame to when it will be done."" ""But I am working on it,"" he said. The BJP MP, who has got CCTVs installed in East Delhi and is also working on getting more ambulances for the area, questioned the delay by AAP in fulfilling its key poll promise. ""One should not promise something that can't be delivered,"" he quipped referring to the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) promise of free WiFi across Delhi and deployment of marshals for women passengers on buses. He also admitted that he does not share any 'equation' with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who he felt was ""a disappointment"". Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari recently argued for urgent implementation of the national citizenship Register (NRC) in Delhi. But Gambhir is in no hurry. ""Whenever NRC is tried in Delhi, it should be by a BJP government and absolutely fool-proof,"" he reasoned. Long before he joined politics, Gambhir's tweets had taken on a nationalistic tenor. He has called Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan, another former cricketer, a ""puppet"" of his country's Army. He said a sportsman like Khan should've spoken of taking everyone together and not focused on drumming up war hysteria at the recently concluded UNGA. He also lashed out at the Opposition for questioning the communication blockade in Kashmir in the aftermath of abrogation of Article 370. ""I remember after Burhan Wani's death, there was crackdown for three months. This is just a precautionary measure."" The BJP MP said the spate of developmental work on the Indian side of Kashmir will one day make the people in the Pakistan occupied Kashmir understand what has been denied to them all this while. He also batted for the relocation of Kashmiri Pandits to their home. During the Lok Sabha elections, Gambhir was accused of circulating derogatory pamphlets against his contender Atishi to sully her image. Though Gambhir had refuted the charge, he chose not to talk about it since. Asked about the episode, Gambhir said: ""Putting that kind of an allegation against someone who could never even think of doing it just because you want to win one seat is bad. Such a low level politics dissuades good people from venturing into it."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" Ahead of Xi Jinping's visit, China ties hit bump: Military drill in NE | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: In a last-minute scare for the Modi-Xi informal summit next week, China has raised strong objection to India's ongoing   Him-Vijay military exercise   in Arunachal Pradesh. Chinese vice foreign minister Luo Zhaohui, who was earlier China's ambassador to India, raised the issue with foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale in a meeting Thursday. Beijing is learnt to have told India that the defence drill could undermine sincere efforts by both sides to have a successful summit. Indian authorities said the exercise was being held at least 100 km away from the LAC and that its timing had nothing to do with the informal summit as it had been planned months in advance. FS holds talks with Chinese vice foreign minister on Xi's upcoming India visitThe summit, while not officially announced yet, remains on schedule - for now - with President Xi Jinping, as a top government source revealed on condition of anonymity, likely to land in Chennai on October 11 around 2 pm. Later that evening, he is expected to travel to the temple town of Mamallapuram for a private dinner with PM Narendra Modi. This informal summit though will probably be of a shorter duration than Wuhan as Xi is not expected to spend more than 24 hours in India. The Luo-Gokhale meeting here remained under the radar with neither side officially confirming the visit by Luo. ToI had first reported about it on October 3. A day earlier, ToI had also reported in detail about the army’s exercise in Arunachal. The military exercise in Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as a part of south Tibet, seems to have upset Beijing no end as it came just a week ahead of Xi's scheduled arrival in Chennai. That India, as the host nation, is yet to officially announce dates for the summit betrays the sensitivities involved both here and in Beijing in scheduling what is probably the most demanding diplomatic engagement of the year for the government. MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said Friday he wasn’t in a position to officially announce the visit, even though he underscored its significance by describing it as an important platform for the 2 leaders to exchange views on a range of issues. Both sides realise that the second informal summit couldn’t have happened at a less opportune moment. China had described India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K, after which Ladakh turned into a separate Union territory, as undermining its sovereignty. India has found it difficult to accept that despite foreign minister S Jaishankar having explained to China, during his August Beijing visit, that Article 370 related developments were entirely an internal matter of India with ""no implication for the external boundaries of India or the LAC with China”, Beijing helped Pakistan seek a UNSC meeting on the same issue days later. India has maintained that cross-border terrorism is the main issue in J&K and the government is likely to prioritise the same in the summit. Both sides though realise that the informal summit was not originally meant to take a deep dive into the specifics of all outstanding issues and that there’s too much at stake to allow any single issue to derail the summit. The Wuhan summit was a success in that the strategic guidance given by the 2 leaders to their respective militaries to build trust and mutual understanding helped prevent any major border flare up in the past 18 months. The 2 countries will hope for a takeaway of similar significance from Mamallapuram, if the summit does indeed happen. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"J&amp;K peaceful, detentions needed: Ram Madhav | Hyderabad News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: BJP national secretary Ram Madhav on Thursday said Kashmir was “peaceful” two months after the defanging of Article 370 due to the preventive detention of over 200 people. The detained were being given “five-star treatment” in hotels and would soon be released, Madhav said during a meeting with retired IAS officers and army officials. He said preventive detention was the most common measure taken to maintain peace in troubled areas. “It is not a human rights violation. The detained are given all facilities,” he claimed and made it clear that under no circumstance would the decision on Article 370 be revoked. “People like Asaduddin Owaisi may say anything, but we took the decision in the interest Kashmiris who were denied development because of this article,” he claimed. Ram Madhav added that all democratic processes would be restored with reservations for STs and setting up of commissions for minorities and women. The BJP leader said all countries barring a few had thrown their weight behind India’s decision. “Countries such as Saudi Arabia and UAE are with us. The army and authorities in Kashmir will make sure that the last terrorist sponsored by Pakistan will be neutralised,” he said. He came down heavily on critics who said that the people of Kashmir were not consulted before the decision was made. “We have said several times that if we come to power, we will do it. This article was not supported by anyone in the then Congress when it was moved to be incorporated in the constitution,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Addressing the India Economic Summit here, Jaishankar said, ""I would say the entire neighbourhood, minus one, has actually been a fairly good story of regional cooperation. Minus one is not forever. I'd hope some day, even the minus one comes around. I always remain hopeful. I'm not unrealistic. They have a mindset issue that they have to overcome.""

Explaining India's neighbourhood policy, he said, ""The Indian subcontinent is among the least regionalised economies. PM Narendra Modi feels we need to do something about this and the Indian economy is a lifting tide for this."" The abrogation of Article 370 provisions did come up for discussion in his meetings during the recent US visit, the foreign minister added. Making nationalism an acceptable position, Jaishankar said there was no doubt that the world had become more nationalistic, and a lot of that was economic nationalism and cultural nationalism. In India's case, nationalism was not a negative sentiment directed at the world, he said. ""India is an exception as we are more nationalistic, but at the same time, we don't see a tension between being nationalistic and being international in the sense of engaging more with the world... so nationalism is not a negative sentiment,"" he added.  Acknowledging that he had spoken extensively on India's decision to abrogate Article 370 in the US, the foreign minister said, ""That is natural for many people when there is a change of status."" He elaborated on the background, history, ""why we did, what we did"" and asserted that a lot of it was new to the people he discussed the matter with.  ""Hardly anybody had the realisation that this (Article 370) was a temporary article in the Constitution or the mis-alignment due to the fact that a lot of the national laws did not apply in J&K. These were all new things to them,"" he said.

 Indian Labour MPs ‘concerned’ about party’s motion on Jammu and Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"LONDON: Indian-origin Labour MPs have expressed concerns about the Kashmir motion passed at their annual party conference days after a British Indian publicly criticised the party at an event on Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary in front of high-profile leaders. Days later, London’s deputy mayor for business Rajesh Agarwal, co-chair of Labour Friends of India, wrote a letter to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn calling for him to meet the Indian community. The emergency motion, passed by Labour on 25 September, states a “major humanitarian crisis” is taking place in the “disputed territory” and calls for “humanitarian and international observers to enter the region”. “We have concerns about the procedure for the selection of the motion, the quality of the evidence that backed it up, the lack of a balanced debate on the subject, and its ultimate selection and adoption. It isn’t for Britain — or indeed any individual political party — to intervene on what is an internal constitutional issue in a third country,” Agarwal wrote to Corbyn. Several Labour MPs, including Corbyn, attended an Indian community event in Parliament Square to honour Gandhi on October 2 at which Jay Shah, spokesperson for Friends of India Society International UK, went on the stage uninvited after Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP spoke. “I took the mike and spoke about the protests outside the High Commission and the Kashmir motion and how Labour is disgraceful,” he told TOI. Britain’s longest-serving MP Keith Vaz, issued a statement late Thursday saying the emergency motion was agreed without the approval of the Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC) or Corbyn and has “created unnecessary divisions within the Indian and Pakistani diaspora in the UK” and within the party. He has written to the NEC Chair, which provides strategic direction to the party, Andi Fox, and to Corbyn, asking them to recall the motion and hold a proper debate at the NEC to adopt a common party position that “does not divide our communities”. But the UK president of the Overseas Friends of BJP, Kuldeep Singh Shekhawat said Vaz’s letter was “a whitewash”. “The Indian community has decided to boycott Labour. We will not vote for Labour. For a year this motion cannot be withdrawn — unless they have another conference,” he said. Labour’s Virendra Sharma MP told TOI he “fully supported” Vaz’s move. “Matters surrounding Kashmir and Article 370 are a matter for India internally, it is not for the Labour party to decide,” he said. Trupti Patel, president of the Hindu Forum Britain, said Labour MPs were still excluded from her society’s Diwali party in the British Parliament. “We are waiting for the Labour party to withdraw the resolution,” she said.

UK Opposition members rally against anti-India Kashmir resolution - Times of India,"LONDON: Members and splinter groups within the UK Opposition Labour Party have rallied together to protest against an anti-India resolution on Kashmir passed recently at the party conference, urging its leader Jeremy Corbyn to seek international observers to enter the region and demand the right of self-determination for people of the Valley. Labour Friends of India (LFIN), the representative diaspora group of the Labour Party, issued a letter to Corbyn and shadow home secretary Emily Thornberry to raise concerns over the procedure followed in the passing of the so-called emergency motion. It came in the wake of the Indian government's revocation of Article 370 in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which LFIN - co-chaired by London's Deputy Mayor for Business Rajesh Agrawal and Darren Jones MP - described as an ""internal constitutional issue in a third country"". ""We have concerns about the procedure for the selection of the motion, the quality of the evidence that backed it up, the lack of a balanced debate on the subject, and its ultimate selection and adoption,"" reads their letter. In an apparent reference to the motion being led by British Pakistani MPs, the group called on the party leadership to not allow the ""politics of the subcontinent to divide communities here in Britain"". Labour Friends of India was among the groups that bore the brunt of the resolution's aftermath as the Indian mission in London cancelled participation in a proposed annual reception and the Ministry of External Affairs also issued a harsh rebuke over the ""uninformed and unfounded"" motion. The group's letter also flags the concern that the controversial resolution was passed at the annual party conference last month when most frontline Opposition MPs had returned to Westminster to attend a resumed House of Commons session, following a Supreme Court ruling that overturned the Parliament's suspension. Other Indian-origin Labour Party MPs have also voiced their concerns over the issue, with Leicester-based MP Keith Vaz saying it had caused ""unnecessary distress and division within the party and the country"" as he wrote to Corbyn to recall the motion. ""Issues of sovereignty are a matter for the Indian government; border issues are matters for the governments of India and Pakistan,"" he noted. Fellow Indian-origin veteran Labour MP Virendra Sharma also described the matter as a ""domestic issue"", which should not involve the party's intervention. ""Matters surrounding Kashmir and Article 370 are a matter for India internally, it is not for the Labour Party to decide. This is a domestic issue which needs resolving within Indian law and the Constitution,"" he said. ""Kashmir has been an integral part of India since 1947 and it is a matter for only the population of Kashmir to decide where they live,"" Sharma said. The Labour Party resolution tabled at its annual party conference in Brighton and passed on September 26 called on Corbyn to meet the high commissioners of both India and Pakistan to ensure there is ""mediation"" and restoration of peace and normality to prevent a potential nuclear conflict. ""Accept that Kashmir is a disputed territory and the people of Kashmir should be given the right of self-determination in accordance with UN resolutions. The Labour party to stand with the Kashmiri people fighting against occupation, this is vital as we stand for social justice and ethical foreign policy,"" it stated.

 Leaders under house arrest in Jammu and Kashmir will be released soon: Ram Madhav | India News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: Senior BJP leader Ram Madhav on Friday said leaders who are currently under house arrest in Jammu and Kashmir will be released soon and they can resume their ""normal"" political activity. Speaking at 'Jana Jagaran Sabha' on abrogation of Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP general secretary said once governors rule is lifted and legislature takes over, constitutional entities such as Commissions for SC, Women and Minorities will be set up in the region. Describing Article 370 as cancer for the past 70 years he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed it in just 70 hours. He said the region which used to reel under law and order problems for months together is now becoming peaceful after over 200 leaders of the state were under house arrest. ""There is this propaganda that you have arrested thousands of people (in J&K). Let me tell you today that those 200 plus leaders are in preventive detention. Preventive detention is a normal law and order arrangement.It doesn't amount to human rights violations. Preventive detention in five star hotels with good facilities with TVs and books and all those things, is a temporary measure to ensure law and order in the state,"" Ram Madhav said. The state was largely quiet barring a few incidents with 200 people in jail, he claimed. ""Now you can imagine how effective this preventive detention is. Please don't mistake me that these people will be jail forever.No. Very soon they will have their freedom. We want normal political activity to be restored in the state. But it has to be normal political activity,"" he added. He claimed Ladakh people were happy now and rejoicing as the region was made a Union Territory and Jammu region was also happy as they are now able to fully integrate with the country. There are issues with Kashmir Valley and they will be dealt with sensitivity,"" he said. According to him, no international community will come and inspect Kashmir based on the false propaganda that there is large-scale human rights violation in the Valley. Ram Madhav said no private investment had come to J&K during the past few decades because of Article 370 which prohibits private persons or entities from owning land. Describing Pakistan as ""epicentre"" of terror, the BJP leader claimed the US will be more friendly with India than Pakistan keeping in view the huge trade between it and India.

 Imran Khan's statements reflect he is not aware how international relations are conducted: MEA | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India on Friday condemned the ""provocative and irresponsible"" statements against it by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan over abrogation of provisions of Article 370 and said he is unaware of how international relations are conducted. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said the comments made by Khan do not behove the post he holds. Kumar was responding to a question on the call for a march from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to the Line of Control, which has been backed by Pakistan's military, to protest India's move. India criticises Malaysia, Turkey for statements on KashmirAt a rally held last month, Khan said he knew that majority of the youth in PoK wanted to stage the march to the LoC. However, he asked them to defer it until he fought the case at the UN General Assembly. ""This is not the first time that such statements have come from Pakistan. Pakistan's prime minister holds a high constitutional office. He has given such statements even before. You have heard his statements even in the UNGA... such provocative and irresponsible language he has used. We condemn this,"" Kumar said. In his maiden speech at the UNGA last month, Khan raised the Kashmir issue and demanded that India must lift the ""inhuman curfew"" in Kashmir and release all ""political prisoners"". Khan devoted half of his address to the Kashmir issue, warning that if there's face-off between two nuclear-armed neighbours, the consequences would be far beyond their borders. ""I think he is not unaware of how international relations are conducted. On that basis, he gives such statements. He had given an open call for Jihad against India. This is not a normal behaviour,"" Kumar said. ""We have been saying that Pakistan and its leaders should behave like a normal neighbouring country. They usually do not do that. We don't expect that but sometimes we do that since we are neighbours. As far as their call of violating some other country's territorial integrity is concerned, it does not behove the office he holds,"" he said. On Pakistan's claim of 58 nations backing it on Kashmir, Kumar said it has not been able to produce the list of the nations. ""Sometimes they kind of make up the number which they did. When people are asking them to show the list, they do not have it,"" the spokesperson said. Ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after New Delhi abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5 to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status, and bifurcated it into two union territories. Pakistan reacted angrily to the move and expelled the Indian envoy. Since then, Pakistan has been trying to rally international support against India on the issue.

 Opposition leaders not speaking against abrogation of Article 370 for fear of public wrath: Jitendra Singh | India News - Times of India,"BALLABHGARH: Union minister Jitendra Singh on Friday said people in the country have fully supported the decision to abrogate the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and that is why opposition leaders are not speaking against it as it would invite public wrath. Singh also said he has visited nearly a dozen states across the country after the announcement of the abrogation of Article 370 provisions and has noticed an overwhelming response from all sections of society in support of the Modi government's decision. ""The opposition leaders are not speaking publicly against the abrogation of Article 370 because they know the risk of doing so. The public mood is fully in support of the historic decision taken by the Modi government and anybody who opposes it would be inviting public wrath and anger,"" he told reporters after accompanying BJP candidate for Ballabgarh Assembly constituency Mool Chand Sharma, who filed the nomination papers. Singh, Union Minister for the PMO, said Haryana has set a unique example on the eve of the assembly elections, since many of its prominent Congress and other opposition leaders have openly come out in support of abrogation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir. So much so, he said, even the Kashmir-centric political parties like the National Conference (NC) and the PDP are finding it difficult to impress upon their Jammu-based leaders to issue any statement against the abrogation of Article 370 provisions. In response to a query, Singh said in Haryana, while the BJP has set before itself the target of 75 plus seats in the Assembly, an added distinction this time would be that the margin of victory of the BJP candidates will be much higher than it was last time. It is virtually going to be a one-sided contest in favour of BJP, he said. Haryana being one of the first states where election is being held after the abrogation of Article 370, this is the beginning of a pan-India BJP reassertion under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said.

" Entire neighbourhood, minus one, has been a good story: Jaishankar | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: In an obvious reference to Pakistan, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday said India's entire neighbourhood ""minus one"" has been a ""fairly good story"" for regional cooperation. The abrogation of Article 370 provisions did come up for discussion in his meetings during the recent US visit, Jaishankar added at a session of the India Economic Summit here. ""That is natural for many people when there is a change of status...,"" he said during a conversation with World Economic Forum president Borge Brende. Jaishankar said he ""spoke fairly extensively"" in the US on the Kashmir issue — on the background, history, ""why we did, what we did"" — and asserted that a lot of it was new to the people he discussed the matter with. ""Hardly anybody had the realisation that this (Article 370) was a temporary article in the Constitution or the mis-alignment due to the fact that a lot of the national laws did not apply in Jammu and Kashmir state. These were all new things to them,"" Jaishankar said. Crying apocalypse Pakistan’s game plan, says S JaishankarDiscussing India's push for strengthening of ties with its neighbours, the minister said, ""I would say the entire neighbourhood, minus one, has actually been a fairly good story of regional cooperation."" Asked if the impasse with 'minus one' would continue, he said he hopes that someday even the 'minus one' comes around to regional cooperation. ""You put Kashmir aside for a moment...Today, with everybody else, trade, business, connectivity and contacts are increasing. Surely, at some stage, that would have an impact because you would see everybody else prospering with that cooperation,"" the external affairs minister said. ""I always remain hopeful. I'm not unrealistic, I know we have big challenges. They (Pakistan) have a mindset issue that they have to overcome,"" Jaishankar said. The two-day India Economic Summit, which ended on Friday, was organised by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industry. Jaishankar said there is no doubt that the world has become more nationalistic, and a lot of that nationalism is economic nationalism and cultural nationalism. In India's case, nationalism is not a negative sentiment directed at the world, he said. ""India is an exception as we are more nationalistic, but at the same time we don't see a tension between being nationalistic and being international in the sense of engaging more with the world... so nationalism is not a negative sentiment,” he said. Asked about the possibility of a trade agreement between India and the US, he said it is not that easy as it is a ""fairly complicated matter"". So if it is taking time it is fine, the minister added. Talking about South Asia cooperation, Jaishankar said, ""The Indian subcontinent is among the least regionalised economies. PM Modi feels we need to do something about this and the Indian economy is a lifting tide for this. You saw that politically when he invited neighbouring countries at his swearing in ceremony in 2014.

 PM Narendra Modi has become one of the most powerful leaders of the world : JP Nadda | India News - Times of India,"HAZARIBAG: BJP working president JP Nadda on Friday said that US President Donald Trump joining Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a programme in Houston recently signalled to the world that PM Narendra Modi has become one of the most powerful leaders in the world. Nadda said that Modi's dynamic leadership during the past five years has also shown to the world that he has become one of the powerful global leaders. When American President Donald Trump broke protocol and joined Modiji in the Howdy Modi programme held recently in Houston, it sent out a signal to the world that the President of a powerful country follows Modiji's developmental programmes, said Nadda.

With strong policies, India will achieve $5 trillion economy by 2025, the former health minister said. On Jammu and Kashmir, Nadda said that the abrogation of Article 370 will help the people of the state to enjoy benefits other people of the country are getting through the developmental programmes. He also praised the Modi government for scrapping triple talaq which, he said, will help Muslim women to join in progressive programmes. Congratulating BJP workers for the latest membership drive, Nadda urged them to work hard in the coming assembly elections in Jharkhand and help the BJP win 65-plus seats in the 81-member House.

Students clash in JNU at Article 370 event | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A lecture, titled “Article 370: Peace, Stability and Development in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh”, organised by JNU administration on Thursday saw yet another clash of ideologies on the campus. Union minister Jitendra Singh, the chief guest at the event, claimed that there were no instances of violence in Kashmir in the last six weeks and, therefore, there was no curfew there. He said that state political leaders placed under house arrest were being given all benefits, adding that Amit Shah was the “most soft-hearted home minister”. The minister’s presence in the university invited protests from a number of student groups. The BJP-affiliated ABVP held a counter-protest and there were minor scuffles. Even before Singh’s arrival, there were protests and sloganeering on the campus. Some students held banners claiming that human development indices in J&K were better than in a number of other states. The ABVP members, in turn, came up with posters to reinforce their point that most people in India were happy with the decision to abrogate Article 370 in J&K. The sloganeering by the two opposing groups prompted Singh to comment that he was unlucky not to be an alumnus of JNU as these protests showed that the values of free speech and free ideas were taught in the university. Training his guns at the Opposition, Singh reminded the gathering that “the Congress party had been constantly diluting Article 370 and initially brought it as a temporary provision”. He said that since August 6 — when the BJP-led central government abrogated Article 370 in J&K — it had been “our endeavour to visit different places of the country, including educational institutions, and tell the people about the historic decision”. Singh also took potshots at India’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru and claimed that “Partition was a grave mistake”. He claimed that development couldn’t happen in J&K because of Article 370, which according to him, proved to be an impediment to private sector investment. “The Northeast did well because of investment, all because of the work done by Modi government,” he said. As Singh was about to leave, the protesting students ran towards his car to gherao it. They were stopped by ABVP members who formed a human chain outside the convention centre, and a scuffle ensued. In a statement, JNUSU later dubbed Singh’s statements as lies. “We oppose the devious agenda being promoted on our campus and will organise a protest meeting with the members of the fact-finding teams and activists from J&K,” it said. ABVP, on the other hand, condemned “this attitude of continued shaming of the university through such incidents and indecent behaviour”. JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar tweeted that the minister’'s speech got “overwhelming response” and it was “a clear indication that the JNU community supports one nation, one Constitution in one voice”. He claimed that “protests by a handful are a clear indication that freedom of expression is valued in our country”. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

The Congress general secretary also tagged a media report on Twitter which claimed that children in Kashmir were away from schools and were disconnected from friends. The about two months 'bandh' in Jammu & Kashmir has impacted innocent children the most, Priyanka Gandhi said.

What kind of message the BJP government is giving to the coming generation of Kashmir, she asked.

Police officials camp along state border in Pathankot | Amritsar News - Times of India,"AMRITSAR: Apprehensive of Pakistan-sponsored terrorists retaliating following the abrogation of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), senior Punjab Police officials of the border range have been camping in Pathankot bordering Kathua district of J&K and Chamba and Kangra districts of Himachal Pradesh to ensure round-theclock vigil. According to intelligence reports, three to four ultras of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) have entered Delhi to play havoc ahead of the festive season. Border range IG S P S Parmar, who has been staying in Pathankot since last week, said police were on highest state of alert in wake of intelligence inputs of terrorist activities. Pathankot is considered as one of the most sensitive district not only because it borders Kathua but also due to its borders with hilly districts of Chamba and Kangra In recent past, police have recovered huge cache of arms and ammunition from Lakhanpur-bordering Pathankot. Earlier, Pakistani fidayeen had struck at the Pathankot Air Force station on January 2, 2016, and Dinanagar police station, about 28km away, on July 27, 2015. “There are riverine gaps on the international border. Pak-based terrorists often infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir and can make their way to Punjab and other states of India. There is a strong possibility of Pak Islamist terrorists having links with Pak-based Sikh terrorists. They could use their support base to provide them logistics in Punjab. The situation is serious and we have to be on highest state of alert,” police sources said. The intelligence alerts were not just limited to usual festive season warnings against terror strikes as the threat has multiplied due to revocation of Article 370 and open support of Pakistan to Kashmiri separatists and Khalistanis, added police sources. Another senior official said there was also a possibility of arms dropping by drone in other parts of Punjab. So far these incidents have been reported from Amritsar only. In addition, there were possibilities of drugs being dropped using China-made drones that fly at a height of around 2,000 feet, a police official said. When asked about use of drones in dropping of arms and drugs in other parts of border areas, Parmar said, “Since the Punjab government has decided to handover the case to NIA, it will not be appropriate for me to comment.” Meanwhile, frisking of passengers crossing the borders touching J&K and Himachal by cars and at railway stations and bus stands has been intensified. Security at Amritsar international airport and Pathankot airport has been further beefed up. The IG said police had held meetings with their counterparts of Chamba and Kangra to discuss the security issues. Kangra SP Vimukat Ranjan said, “We have made adequate arrangements and we are on high alert.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" Crying apocalypse Pakistan’s game plan, says S Jaishankar | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: Painting apocalyptic scenarios has been part of Pakistan’s game plan for Kashmir, but New Delhi is confident of bringing normalcy to the region, India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar asserted during a grand tour of Washington’s foreign policy community this week, aimed, among other things, at explaining the rationale for the   Modi government’s move to scrap Article 370   and change the status quo. The exercise evidently succeeded in reassuring Washington, where the Trump administration has implicitly   supported India’s decision   to change the dynamics of the region in the face of Pakistan’s intransigence over the terrorism issue. A state department readout of   Jaishankar’s meeting   with his US counterpart Mike Pompeo said the two “discussed a range of issues, including the growing US-India strategic relationship, developments in Kashmir, and global issues of concern”. “They also discussed plans to advance our complementary visions of a free and open Indo-Pacific region following the successful Quadrilateral Consultations on the margins of the UNGA last week,” the readout added. The glancing reference to Kashmir without any critical asides and the expansive nature of their talks suggested Washington did not share the alarm or hysteria expressed in Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s histrionics at the UNGA. It may have made good theatre and headlines, but going by   Jaishankar’s seven thinktank engagements   in seven days in the US, and global reactions, it has left the foreign thintank community unimpressed. The MEA-mandarin turned foreign minister was heard respectfully throughout the week, with the capital’s seasoned veterans expressing admiration for his expansive presentations. “I’ve studied India for 30 years, when its foreign policy was largely hesitant, reactive and ineffectual. My takeaway from @DrSJaishankar is that India now has a firm grasp of its interests around the world and an assertive, self-confident and purposeful strategy to advance them,” tweeted Peter Lavoy, a former senior administration official in the Obama White House, whose scholarship includes Assymmetric Warfare in South Asia, reflecting on the Indian foreign minister’s tour. The India-Pakistan asymmetry — and Pakistan’s use of terror under nuclear cover and Imran Khan’s repeated invocation of nuclear war — was one of the issues Jaishankar addressed on the occasions he spoke about Islamabad and its obsession with Kashmir (which formed only a small part of his presentations). Indeed, Pakistan’s hype about an imminent conflagration got another academic boost on Jaishankar’s last day in the US with a new report report that projected the fallout and death count from a nuclear war with India: around 125 million fatalities, a 35% reduction in sunlight reaching Earth’s surface, a 15-30% decrease in rainfall, and consequent famine and food shortage for a generation. But it was the premise of how the nuclear war could begin — in the paper published in Science Advances — that was eye-catching. The scenario involves militants attacking India’s parliament in 2025, killing most of its leaders. New Delhi retaliates by sending tanks into Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. Fearing it will be overrun, Islamabad hits the invading forces with its battlefield nuclear weapons, triggering an Indian retaliation and an all-out nuclear war. Indeed, that has pretty much been the scenarios Islamabad has also projected except for accusing India of staging a “false flag” operation to attack Pakistan. In India’s eyes, invoking nuclear war is a desperate gambit on part of a country that has no past, no future, and no hope.

"Day after defying Congress boycott, Rae Bareli MLA Aditi Singh gets Y-plus security cover | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: A day after Congress MLA from Rae Bareli, Aditi Singh, defied her party’s decision to stay away from the 36-hour special session and praised chief minister, the Yogi Adityanath government provided ‘Y- Plus’ category security to her on Thursday. The MLA had earlier met CM Yogi seeking adequate security after her motorcade was attacked in May.

After security upgrade, 10 armed guards will be in her security cover. The Y-plus security includes two personal security officers, an escort vehicle with four personnel, and four guards at her residence,” added Mamgain. Aditi was provided the upgraded security cover on Thursday itself as she left from Lucknow for Rae Bareli, said officials.

 Leaders under house arrest in Kashmir getting choicest preferences: Jitendra Singh | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Union minister Jitendra Singh on Thursday said the leaders under house arrest in Kashmir are getting choicest preferences and enjoying hospitality more than he would have enjoyed in his own house. Delivering a lecture at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on the topic 'Abrogation of Article 370: Peace, Stability and Development', he hailed scrapping of provisions of Article 370 saying the legislation had caused isolation of Jammu and Kashmir's youth and facilitated terrorism in the state. The event saw some students affiliated with Left organisations raising slogans against scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir's special status. Singh who hails from Jammu, in a lighter vein termed their sloganeering as a ""grand welcome"" saying he was glad that the students were ""curious and enthusiastic"" to express themselves on the subject. Vice Chancellor Jagdesh Kumar asserted that JNU with ""one voice"" supported scrapping of Article 370 provisions like the rest of India. Singh said those under ""restrictive house arrest"" in Kashmir were in fact enjoying the hospitality. ""This is not incarceration, (it is) some kind of restrictive house arrest. That too a house arrest where you get choicest preferences. Some of those under house arrest are enjoying more hospitality than that I would enjoy in my own house. Some of them were asking for brown bread, some were asking for Hollywood (movie) videos,"" he said. Several prominent Kashmiri leaders including Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and PDP's Mehbooba Mufti are under detention. Singh also claimed that no curfew was imposed in the state in the last six weeks. He said that the ordinary people in Srinagar were happy with the scrapping of Article 370 which he termed as ""huge impediment"" in the path of development and investment in the state. ""In the next 3-4 months, amazing development will be seen in Jammu and Kashmir because the hurdle (Article 370) has been removed,"" he said. Singh said had Jawaharlal Nehru allowed Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to deal with Jammu and Kashmir like he did with other princely states, there would been no issue of Article 370. He said even Nehru had contended it was a temporary provision and assured Syama Prasad Mookerji that ""ye dhara ghiste-ghiste, ghis jayegi (this will eventually die its own death)."" He attacked the Congress for protesting against Article 370 saying it is doing so because it could not achieve what Nehru desired.

 Fake news more dangerous than paid news: I&amp;B minister Javadekar | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Fake news is more dangerous than paid news and there is need for the government and the media to combat it jointly, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said on Thursday. The government will not take any step that may curb media freedom, the minister said and suggested there should be some kind of regulation on over-the-top platforms (OTT), as there is for the print and electronic media as well as films. In an interaction with PTI journalists at the news agency's headquarters here, Javadekar said several mainstream media outlets have conveyed to the government that that there was no level-playing field with OTT platforms being completely unregulated. ""I have sought suggestions on how to deal with this because there are regular feature films coming on OTT - good, bad and ugly. So how to deal with this, who should monitor, who should regulate. There is no certification body for OTT platforms and likewise news portals also,"" he said. At the same time, he said the government has not taken any decision on the matter. The Press Council of India takes care of the print media, the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) monitors news channels, the Advertising Standards Council of India is for advertising while the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) takes care of films, he said. ""However, there is nothing for the OTT platforms,"" the I&B minister said. There has been a spurt in news portals in India with several of them seeing a rise in the number of online subscribers. Javadekar also expressed concern over fake news, saying it is ""more dangerous than paid news"". ""Fake news has to be stopped and that is our joint work. It is not just the government's job, it is everybody's job. Those who are in the business of genuine news, they all must strive hard (to combat it),"" the minister said. He said several media channels are tackling the menace by showing the truth with programmes such as ""Viral Sach"", and added that the print media should also carry columns on similar lines uncovering the truth of fake news. ""We have seen in the last few months that fake news on social media and gossip, rumours on child lifting have resulted in the deaths of more than 20-30 people in mob violence,"" he said. Javadekar said the government is doing its bit to combat the menace and has run programmes on Doordarshan News such as 'Kashmir ka Sach' to tackle fake news about Kashmir, where Article 370 provisions were abrogated on August 5. ""We will be fast enough to react if there is fake news on government matter but the government is also concerned about overall public order. We are also asking state administrators to act (in countering fake news),"" he said. Many district magistrates have placed facts before the public to counter fake news about their area, he said. Talking about paid news, the minister said it is unethical and the media community has to stop it. ""It has to give us (the government) suggestions, so that we all can act together to ensure that the small percentage of media that indulges in this are punished and this practice goes away,"" Javadekar said. On the 10 per cent customs duty to be levied on imported newsprint and the subsequent demands for a rollback from the print media industry, Javadekar said discussions have taken place on the issue involving all stakeholders and the matter will be settled.

They said the communication blockade, which was put in place on August 5 and is set to enter its third month, has severely affected the working of journalists in Kashmir. More than 100 journalists working in international, national and local media outlets took part in the silent protest which started from Kashmir Press Club. ""The communication blockade, which is set to enter third month now, has severely affected the working of journalists in Kashmir. Even the local newspapers have not been able to publish properly while their internet editions are defunct,"" president of Kashmir Press Club Shuja ul Haq said. He said all the media associations have come together to press the government to lift the communication blockade so that they can freely discharge their professional duties. Holding placards, some of the protesting journalists later carried out a peaceful march from Polo View to Press Colony on Residency Road here. The journalists later dispersed peacefully. Jammu and Kashmir government has established a media facilitation centre in a private hotel here. However, the journalists feel that the facility is inadequate as there are only 10 computer terminals for nearly 400 strong press corps. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" NSA gets teeth, Secretariat put in government business rules | India News - Times of India","(This story originally appeared in  on Oct 3, 2019)NEW DELHI: The National Security Council Secretariat, which reports to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, has been brought into the government’s Allocation of Business (AOB) rules, thus granting it constitutional recognition and legal authority. The amendment to government’s rules of business, which was made last month, also gives an official description to the role of National Security Advisor as “the principal advisor on national security matters to the prime minister”. It also makes it clear that the NSCS will be the secretariat for the PM-led National Security Council (NSC). The NSCS, also called the Rashtriya Suraksha Parishad Sachivalaya, has been enumerated right after NITI Aayog at number 50 in the first schedule of the AOB rules. Unlike in the case of other departments, the government has refrained from going into any detailed elaboration of the NSCS functions, except stating that it will “assist the National Security Advisor, the principal advisor on national security matters to the PM, and NSC”. Significant: The govt has amended cabinet provisions to include the National Security Council Secretariat, which as… https://t.co/Sd5R3WtRMR— Pranab Dhal Samanta (@pranabsamanta) 1570076329000The amendment to the rules, which was done on August 6 when Parliament was debating the withdrawal of Article 370 from Jammu & Kashmir, provides the NSA with a clearer domain and authority. Doval, who was given cabinet rank status in PM Narendra Modi’s second term, already heads two important bodies – the Strategic Policy Group (SPG), which is to identify long-term threats and priorities as well as the Defence Planning Group that is meant to work to closely with the proposed Chief of Defence Staff on prioritising procurements for all three services. This move also mainstreams the NSCS and gives it the authority to service the NSC, SPG and even the DPG. It can now generate cabinet notes, access relevant cabinet proposals and partake in inter-ministerial deliberations just like any other government department. Until now, the Cabinet Secretary would have to send out periodic reminders to various ministries to route relevant notes through the NSCS for comments. The NSCS was formed two decades ago, as an outcome of the elaborate post-Kargil review. It was formed to assist the then newly created NSA’s post and was housed within the cabinet secretariat. In 2002, it was brought under the PMO. The Strategic Policy Group was created then under the cabinet secretary with the NSA as the member. This was changed last year when Doval was made head of a reconstituted SPG and the NSCS was tasked to service it. Questions were raised on the legal sanctity of the body as both the NSA and NSCS, unlike the cabinet secretary and the cabinet secretariat, were not identified and made part of the government’s rules of business. The NSCS, however, has expanded hugely over the years, especially under Doval. It now has four broad verticals – strategic affairs, military, internal security as well as foreign and intelligence – headed by either a Deputy NSA or an officer of that seniority. It even sends proposals to the Cabinet after taking special permission, which will now not be needed. Through this amendment to AOB, the government has firmed up a clear structure for the NSC, which comprises the PM, the home minister, the defence minister, the finance minister and the external affairs minister.

" Massive traffic jams in Srinagar, some shops open in morning hours | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: Kashmir Valley showed some signs of normalcy on Thursday, with massive traffic jams witnessed in summer capital Srinagar and some shops opening in the city in the morning hours. However, the government's efforts to reopen schools, which have now been closed for two months following abrogation of Article 370, failed again as students stayed away from educational institutions, officials said. Massive traffic jams were witnessed in several areas of the city here as the movement of private vehicles increased, officials said. They said additional traffic personnel had to be deployed in the city to regulate traffic as the increased movement of private transport, auto-rickshaws and inter-district cabs led to jams at various places especially at intersections. Main markets and other business establishments in Kashmir remained shut on Thursday, even as some shops in the city were open till 11 am, they said. ""Mobile services remained suspended in Kashmir except in Handwara and Kupwara areas in the north, while internet services - across all platforms - continued to be snapped in the valley since the night of August 4,"" officials said. The functioning of schools in Kashmir has remained affected since August 5 when the Centre announced its decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and to bifurcate the state into two Union territories. Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Baseer Khan had on Monday directed all deputy commissioners and officers concerned to ensure that all government schools as well as private institutions up to Higher Secondary level of the valley be open by Thursday and Colleges to open by or before 9 October. The officials said the state government was trying its best to have normal functioning in schools, but its efforts have not borne any fruit as most parents continued to keep children at home due to apprehensions about their safety. The officials said there were no restrictions anywhere in the valley, but security forces were deployed in strength in vulnerable areas to maintain law and order. Most of the top level and second rung separatist politicians have been taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders, including two former chief ministers -- Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, have been either detained or placed under house arrest. Another former chief minister and sitting Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar Farooq Abdullah has been arrested under the controversial Public Safety Act.

Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his move, he said every Indian wanted the removal of Article 370 which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. He said the Article, which had prevented the full integration of Jammu and Kashmir, was part of history now and the decision was taken at a meeting of union cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister in August. It was followed by a resolution which was adopted by the two houses of Parliament. ""Kashmir is free of Article 370 and Article 35 A and is part of India like any other state. I feel Article 370 was not only an obstacle for the unity and integrity of the country, but it was also the biggest obstacle in the development of Kashmir. The obstacles in the development of Kashmir have been removed and I have confidence that Kashmir will be among the most developed states in 10 years and a beginning has been made through the Railways,"" Shah said. The Vande Bharat Express train flagged off on Thursday will connect New Delhi with Katra in Jammu and Kashmir. Shah said Modiji had given a big gift to the residents of the state and the Vande Bharat train will play a big role in the growth of religious tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. ""For the development of Jammu and Kashmir religious tourism will play a big part, there cannot be any village in India where people do not want to go to Mata Vaishno Devi temple."" He also thanked the Indian Railways for timely completion of the project. ""I want to thank the Indian Railways from the core of my heart for giving this gift to Jammu and Kashmir in the auspicious occasion of Navratri,"" Shah said.

Shah, who was accompanied by railway minister Piyush Goyal, Union ministers Jitendra Singh and Harsh Vardhan, flagged off the train from New Delhi Railway Station.

Flagging off the second edition of the indigenous train, Shah said, ""I believe that not only was Article 370 a roadblock for the unity of this country, but it was also the biggest roadblock for the development of Kashmir. I am sure that after the removal of this Article, we will be successful in completely eradicating terrorism and the ideas promoting terrorism in the area."" ""Within the next 10 years, Jammu and Kashmir will be one of the most developed regions of the country and the journey of development has begun with Vande Bharat Express which is set to boost development and promote religious tourism,"" he said at the launch. Minister of State in the PMO Jitender Singh said the abrogation of Article 370 provisions in J&K was one gift for the people of the region after ""three decades of struggle"" and the launch of the train was another gift which would contribute in building ""new Jammu and Kashmir"". ""The Vande Bharat Express will bring new India to new Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. The Vande Bharat Express is likely to cut the travel time between between Delhi and Katra to just eight hours.

He also promised that railways will connect the rest of the country from Kashmir to Kanyakumari before August 15, 2022. This is the second Vande Bharat Express, the first runs between Delhi and Varanasi. The new train has a bigger pantry compared to the first Train 18 or Vande Bharat Express, that runs between Delhi and Varanasi. It also has windows with a special provision to protect against stone-pelting and a cattle guard in the front to prevent damage to the train or derailment in case of cattle run. To avoid damage due to stray cattle, the train has been equipped with a sturdy aluminium-clad nose cover.

"Congress Rae Bareli MLA Aditi Singh defies party, praises UP CM Yogi Adityanath | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Breaking ranks with the Opposition, which boycotted the special 36-hour non-stop session of the UP Assembly, the Congress MLA from Sonia Gandhi's parliamentary constituency Rae Bareli not only joined the session on Wednesday, the first day, but also spoke to thunderous applause from the Treasury benches. The Opposition Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress had decided to stay away from the special session called by chief minister Yogi Adityanath to discuss development issues under the 16-point charter of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Barring Aditi Singh, who is Congress MLA from Rae Bareli Sadar Assembly constituency, the Opposition succeeded in keeping its flock together. ‘My presence a tribute to Bapu’Singh was in the news earlier with her praise of Yogi, triggering speculation that she may defect to BJP. Singh, however, has denied any such move. With the Treasury benches cheering her, Singh began her speech at the Assembly on Wednesday by praising Yogi. Singh said she was thankful to the CM for promising to change the format of panchayat elections from the existing indirect elections to direct polls. Singh said she decided to join the special session as it has been called as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, which inspired her to rise above party lines to pay tribute to Gandhi. The Congress high command had recently elevated Singh to Mahila Congress all-India general secretary, projecting her as a future leader, and also nominated her as the all-India in-charge of the Priyadarshini project to connect with women and young girls. Singh sat along with Independent MLA Amanmani Tripathi in the assembly. Showering praise on Yogi, Singh — a first-time MLA — said under the BJP government houses were being allotted to the poor in an impartial manner while in the past this used to be riddled with caste considerations. She said she has risen above party lines whenever she felt she should do so for nation-building. It was for this reason that she supported the Centre on stripping Jammu & Kashmir of the special status granted to it by Article 370. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Abrogation of Article 370 was long-awaited: Jaishankar | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: Describing the abrogation of article 370 as a ""long awaited"" step and the ""right thing"" to do, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said it is expected from Pakistan to pull out all stops to challenge the decision as it has made deep investment in fuelling terrorism in Kashmir. Asserting that the Indian security forces have exercised highest degree of restrain in Jammu and Kashmir after August 5, Jaishankar told a Washington audience that he expects Pakistan to continue what it has been doing for the past several decades. ""What do you expect the Pakistanis to say (after current restrictions are lifted and normalcy is restored)… we expect calm and happiness to return,"" Jaishankar said in response to a question during his appearance at The Heritage Foundation, a top American think-tank. ""No, they (Pakistan) will not. They will paint apocalyptic scenarios because one that is their wish and two that's actually what their game plan has been for 70 years,"" he added. He was responding to a question on recent remarks by top Pakistani leadership alleging that India would raise a false flag and blame Islamabad for any terrorist attack after the recent security and communication restrictions are lifted in Kashmir. ""I think it's important to have a historical context to judge these remarks. This is not a conversation that began on August 5. These are their policies and their actions which began the day Kashmir acceded to India with Pakistani invaders threatening to burn down Srinagar. Please look at the history of Kashmir,"" Jaishankar said. As such there is a lot out there which needs to be taken into account, he said, noting that India's endeavour will be to ""manage this as well as it can"". ""I'm reasonably confident we should succeed out there,"" he said. ""We have also seen a lot of alarmists rhetoric coming (from Pakistan), not just about false flag, (but also) jihad... going all the way to nuclear weapons. That kind of gives you a sense of responsibility of the people who are saying,"" the minister said. Responding to another question on India's action plan on getting back Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir, Jaishankar said that the territory is under illegal occupation of Pakistan. ""The point I was making was a very simple one. My sovereignty and my jurisdiction is laid out by my maps. My maps have been there for 70 years,"" he said. ""That's my claim. And naturally, if I have a claim, as you would have a claim, as anybody would have a claim, we would hope one day that if there are territories in your claim of which you don't have physical jurisdiction one day, you will. It's as simple as that,"" Jaishankar said. Jaishankar further said the abrogation of article 370 was not a small step. ""What we've done, was long awaited. In my view, it was the right thing to have been done. It should have been done many years earlier,"" he said. ""At the moment, given the fact that there have been such deep investments made by Pakistan in Kashmir, both in terrorism and in a kind of separatism... we don't expect this to be uncontested,"" he said. There are going to be reactions to that. India's strategy is obviously to reason with people and get them to understand why all of this is for their long-term benefit, he added. ""Clearly our intention is that they would buy into that"", so that there is likely success of this new policy, he said further. In that interim period, he asserted, India will take precautions, because history has shown the need for precautions. The government will fail in its duty if it does not take that call, Jaishankar said, adding that instructions given to the security forces have been to exercise extreme restrain.

 J&amp;K: 12 habeas corpus pleas filed in HC for release of juveniles | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: The central juvenile law is likely to be extended to the newly created Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir from November 1. The central law says that in cases of heinous crimes, the court may, on the advice of Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), treat a person between the age of 16 and 18 as an adult. As of now, J&K treats anyone below the age of 18 accused of any crime as minor. As the administration is gearing to apply the central juvenile law, J&K HC has received a dozen habeas corpus petitions from parents for the release of their minor wards, who have allegedly being detained. Habeas corpus is a writ requiring a person under arrest to be brought before a judge or into court, especially to secure the person's release unless lawful grounds are shown for his/her detention. On August 5 this year, Parliament had ended J&K’s special status by defanging Article 370 and reorganising the state into two Union Territories — J&K and Ladakh — thereby fully integrating the state with the Indian Union and paving the way for all central laws to be applicable there. Parliament had amended the Juvenile Justice Act (JJA) in 2015, making it legally permissible to try juveniles in the age group of 16-18 as adults for heinous crimes like rape and murder. The law was amended following a national outrage over the horrific Nirbhaya gangrape-cum-murder case, in which an accused aged 17 years and six months got away as juvenile due to the earlier outer age limit of 18. On September 20, the Supreme Court had assigned J&K high court’s Juvenile Justice Committee to inquire into allegations of illegal detention of children — some as young as 10 years. Following this, the chairman of the J&K High Court Legal Services Committee, Justice Ali Mohammad Magray, had visited observation homes in the Valley.

There’s no negativity in my resignation: Sasikanth Senthil | Mangaluru News - Times of India,"MANGALURU: Former Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner and IAS officer S Sasikanth Senthil, who surprised the nation with his decision to resign on September 6, made his first public appearance in Dakshina Kannada on Wednesday. On the sidelines of his visit to deliver a talk as part of Gandhi 150 Chintana Yatre, the former DC said there was no negativity attached to his resignation. “I’m already working at the grassroots level and will travel across the nation wherever there is a problem,’’ he said. Senthil said that his resignation was a personal and national thing. “I have explained the reasons for my resignation in the letter. I was not under pressure from the state government. As a DC in three districts, I received good support from all the three parties in power. It is a personal and national thing.” Soon after his resignation, the former DC was called anti-national after he expressed displeasure over abrogation of Article 370. When asked to describe nationalism, he said, “For me humanism is nationalism. We are a nation which is built on those basic structures. There are indications and threats as always in any society. As long as we stand firm in our foundation, I don’t think this country that is very big, will be disturbed.” He said the backlash was expected, but it came as a surprise to his well-wishers. Senthil said that life has opened up for him after he submitted his resignation. “I am enjoying talking with people at the grassroots level. I understand their issues which I probably could not understand as the DC. In that way life has become interesting. I am more equipped to do good work as I can express, write, study and be with the public and even influence the government. I have taken the right choice and there is no negativity about my resignation. I have an ethical and moral responsibility to raise my voice to what is happening.”  On the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Senthil said it was irrelevant to comment on US president Donald Trump calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the father of India.

" Pak PM's claim about curfew, clampdown in Kashmir far from truth: J-K govt | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir government on Wednesday said Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's reference to the situation in the state at the United Nations General Assembly last week was a ""story of falsehoods"", asserting that life in the valley had returned to near normal since the abrogation of Article 370 in August this year. ""Pakistani PM Imran Khan's address at the UNGA is a story of falsehoods. By peddling half truths and deliberate lies, Pakistan was attempting to divert attention from its own terror record, including its brazen support to militants in Jammu and Kashmir,"" a senior official of the state government said in a statement here. The official said Khan's claim about curfew and clampdown in Kashmir was far from truth as only ""limited restrictions on movement had been imposed by the local administration in some parts to prevent miscreants from fomenting trouble but these too were relaxed in less than a week's time"". He said the quantum and frequency of these relaxations has been progressively increasing to a point that now almost the entire state is free of restrictions. ""Jammu and Kashmir is free for any movement and accessible to all including citizens, outsiders, journalists and all others for free movement. It is a myth being propagated that there is a virtual clampdown in J&K. Nothing could be farther from the truth. This is proven by the traffic visible on the roads with traffic jams, the passenger air traffic, the normal functioning of hospitals, the availability of essential civil supplies, and the free access of journalists,"" he said. ""The very fact that all highways remain open, all air operations are normal and traffic is plying normally is sufficient to prove the 'clampdown theory' is the vestige of imagination of a neighbour who has been dismayed to find that the situation in J&K has remained peaceful with not a single live bullet being fired,"" he added. Giving details, the official said the National Highway connecting Jammu to Srinagar and onwards to Kargil and Leh continues to function normally. Over 1,000 vehicles traverse the route every day carrying food, fuel, medicines and other supplies to the valley and onwards to Ladakh and carrying back exports, including apples and handicraft products, to the rest of the country. ""Over 200 journalists from all major national print and electronic media and international media, including BBC, Washington Post, New York Times, Foreign Policy, AP, AFP, Reuters, DW, Al Jazeera, etc., have been reporting freely including many who are critical of the government,” he said. The official said while a deliberate and false narrative was being created to project a troop build up and human rights violations, the genuine issues of the local population such as the threats being posed by militants to civilians wanting to resume normal life were being ignored. ""It is well known that there are strong coercive influences being exerted on ordinary Kashmiris through overt and covert threats not to resume normal activities and businesses. A girl as young as 4 years was shot at merely because her family wanted to carry out their normal economic activity. A 65-year-old shopkeeper was killed merely because he wanted to earn his normal livelihood by keeping his shop open,"" he added. The official said unlike Pakistan, India is a secular nation with a rule of law and a strong independent democratic, judicial and human rights institutional mechanism. ""Any detentions made are under prescribed laws and subject to strict judicial review. Any human rights complaints are subjects to strict and constant investigation and oversight both locally and federally, But what is unfortunate is that while Pakistan is very vocal of the rights of trouble creators, terrorists and thugs, it has hardly anything to say either for those Kashmiris who are coerced and shot at by elements sponsored by it,"" he said.

 Ajit Doval leaves for Saudi Arabia to counter Imran’s claims on J&amp;K | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India is reaching out to Saudi Arabia at the highest levels to sensitise the leadership in Riyadh about the government’s   August 5 decision   on Kashmir. National security advisor Ajit Doval travelled to Riyadh on Tuesday to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and hold discussions on bilateral and regional issues. Doval’s visit comes after Pakistani PM Imran Khan stopped over in Riyadh to enlist Mohammed bin Salman’s support for Pakistan’s Kashmir ‘cause’. Doval’s visit is a signal from New Delhi of the importance given to ties and sentiments of the Saudi leadership. The NSA’s presence is significant not merely because he is the highest-ranking emissary of the prime minister. He has personally spearheaded the government action in Kashmir after Parliament voted to de-operationalise Article 370 of the Constitution. Doval will emphasise to the Saudi leadership on how the move was an internal one, how the whole idea has been to integrate Kashmir with the rest of the country by allowing all laws and benefits applicable to the country in that state. Pakistan’s diplomatic exertions in the past few weeks brought it   support from countries   like China, Malaysia and Turkey.

US voices popular fear of Pakistani terrorists launching terror strikes in India post Article 370 - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Tuesday voiced fears of many countries that following abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir special status, Pakistani terrorists might launch terror strikes in India unless Pakistan ""keep a lid on militant groups"". ""I think many have concerns that Pakistan keep a lid on militant groups that might conduct cross-border activities as a result of the Kashmir decisions, and I don't sense that China wants that kind of conflict or would support that,"" assistant secretary of defense for Indo Pacific Security Affairs, Randall Shriver, told a Washington audience. Shriver was responding to a question on China's support to Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir after India nullified articles 370 and 35A of its the Constitution that gave special privileges to Jammu and Kashmir. ""I think it (China's support to Pakistan on Kashmir) is mostly diplomatic and political support,"" Shriver said. ""They (Chinese) have supported Pakistan in international fora. There is some discussion about whether or not Kashmir would be taken up in the UN, China would support that. But in terms of something beyond that or more active, I don't see it,"" the top Pentagon official said. China has a long-standing relationship with Pakistan, and they have growing competition with India, he said, adding that India seeks a stable relationship with China. Referring to the ongoing visit of India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Shriver said the US is having consultations with him. ""We have talked about the relationship with China. They want a stable relationship with China, but there's no doubt that there is growing concern and competition there as well. So I think on a range of issues to include Kashmir, China has leaned toward Pakistan,"" Shriver said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
" Outcome of current arguments between US, China will significantly impact world: Jaishankar | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: The outcome of the current arguments between the US and China will significantly impact rest of the world and create new approaches to the global affairs, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has said. Speaking at a programme organised by a major US think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies on Tuesday, Jaishankar said the primary characteristics of world politics today are rebalancing of the global economy and polity. ""The primary characteristics of world politics today are the rebalancing of the global economy and polity, as well as the sharpening contradiction between the United States and China,"" he said. ""Both powers are engaging the world in a manner different from their past. Whatever the outcome of their current arguments, their behaviour will impact the rest of the world very significantly. It will change our thinking and probably in time, create new approaches to global affairs,"" he said. Describing the current era as a tumultuous time, he said it is a far cry from the soothing mantras of globalisation that one heard just a few years ago. During his address that was based on the subject ""Preparing for a Different Era"", the minister said that preparation for a more competitive and complex era will require a different mindset and for a country like India it would be in addition to the changes induced by its climb up the global power hierarchy. ""Preparing for a more competitive and complex era will require a different mindset. For a nation like India, this would be in addition to the changes induced by its climb up the global power hierarchy,"" he said. Giving a sense of the Modi 2.0 foreign policy, Jaishankar said that India's broad approach will be reflected in the primacy of long-term thinking over short-term calculations. ""It would encourage undertaking deep structural changes and ambitious socio-economic initiatives that can transform both habits and attitudes. In this world, what were presumed to be intractable challenges will have to be addressed, not ducked. An example to point is that of the recent changes in the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir,” Jaishankar said. India ended Jammu and Kashmir's special status by abrogating Article 370 of its Constitution on August 5. Stating that in this different era, there will be convergence with many but congruence with none, Jaishankar said that finding common points to engage with as many power centres will characterise diplomacy at its highest level. ""For this reason, India finds it perfectly natural to engage a Chinese leader at Wuhan, the Russian one at Sochi and then go on to do the ‘2+2' meeting of foreign and defence ministers with the United States,” he said. ""At the G-20 in Buenos Aires last year, it engaged back to back, in fact this year as well, in two tri-laterals: US-Japan-India as well as Russia-India-China. The country that fares the best is the one which has least problems with its peer group and the broadest acceptance beyond,"" he said. Jaishankar said that the game has now become one of positioning and optimising. ""For a number of reasons, the game has now become one of positioning and optimising. The reality is that India either reaches out in as many directions as possible and maximizes its gains or takes a more defensive approach of avoiding engagement,"" Jaishankar said. ""This is not just about greater ambition, it is also about not living in yesterday. In this intensely competitive world, India's goal should be to move closer towards the strategic sweet spot,” said the Indian minister. Cautioning that a world of ""all against all” is neither desirable nor indeed probable, he said the weight of history and the compulsions of politics will make sure that convergences end up as some form of collectivism and nor can beliefs and values be divorced from the behaviour of states. ""Thus, even as we look at an era of more dispersed power and sharper competition, the way forward is more likely to be new forms of accommodation rather than pure transactions,” he said. He said while each nations will naturally strive to advance their particular interests, similarities and affinities will always remain a factor. “So, while this is an exposition on changes in international affairs, I would emphasise that the direction is towards a new architecture rather than the absence of one,” he said.

" The Full Jaishankar: 7 think-tanks in 7 days; after New York, India’s foreign policy czar works on Washington | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: In American TV business, the term Full Ginsburg refers to an appearance by one person on all five major Sunday morning talk shows on the same day. It is named after William Ginsburg, the lawyer for Monica Lewinsky during the scandal involving President Bill Clinton, who was the first person to accomplish the feat in 1998. No such term has been coined for someone appearing before five think-tanks in Washington DC, but the “Full Jaishankar” may well become a benchmark for engaging the foreign policy brains’ trust in the United States. Even accounting for appearances stretching across a week between other strenuous meetings and encounters, India’s new external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s blitz in Washington DC – a city someone said has more think tanks than some countries have battle tanks – constitutes the most intense interaction between New Delhi and Washington’s weighty foreign policy community since the exertions of his one-time boss and predecessor Jaswant Singh in the aftermath of the Shakti nuclear test. A former foreign secretary and ambassador to the US, Dr J, in a span of 72 hours, is jousting with five of Washington DC’s most prestigious talk shops: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Atlantic Council, Center for Strategic and International Studies, The Brookings Institution, and the Heritage Foundation, not to speak of engaging the US Congress. This, after having already engaged with the Center for Foreign Relations and Asia Society in New York on the sidelines of UN General Assembly. That New Delhi wants to engage the world beyond Pakistan is no great secret, its vision broader and wider in scope than that of India- and Kashmir-obsessed Pakistan. Which is why despite the clamor about the Kashmir issue in the run-up to the UN meet and thereafter, Jaishankar listed meeting 42 foreign ministers, holding 36 bilateral meetings, eight pull asides, seven multilaterals/plurilaterals and three speaking engagements, in addition to supporting Prime Minister Modi’s own engagements with more than a dozen world leaders. More is happening in Washington DC currently, including meetings with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defence Secretary Mark Esper, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien, and Acting Homeland Secretary Kevin McAleenan. But inasmuch as New Delhi’s engagement with the US and the global community is broad-based, with strategic ties with major nations and trade with all topping the agenda, the Kashmir issue has bubbled up in meetings, affording India an opportunity to explain its stand on a matter where Islamabad has mendaciously subverted the narrative, including that fact that the erstwhile state legally acceded to India and it is Pakistan which has illegally annexed what it calls “Azad Kashmir.” The UN resolutions that Islamabad keeps yammering about also calls on Pakistan to vacate the portion it has seized (no such direction to India) before any steps can be considered relating to plebiscite, a process which in any case is infructuous given the demographic and geographical changes in the region, including Pakistan ceding portions of the erstwhile state to China. In a media briefing (separate ones for US and Indian journalists amid all other engagements), Jaishankar said the subject of Kashmir came up in at least half his meetings, with concern centering mostly on the civil liberties issue rather than New Delhi’s scrapping of Article 370. He explained to interlocutors that Article 370 was a temporary provision in India’s constitution from the get-go and it was always due to be removed, and the current security dragnet in the Valley was aimed primarily at preventing loss of life. “I like my internet but it not equal to (loss of) life,” Jaishankar said, referring to criticism about curtailment of communication. India’s foreign policy czar was also dismissive of the idea that New Delhi’s move in Jammu and Kashmir had re-hyphenated India with Pakistan, telling a journalist, ""You are really being very semantic about it. How do you hyphenate a country, which is one-eighth of your economic size ... which is reputationally your exact opposite?"" By that logic India should not do anything which would bring Pakistan into the conversation at all, he added. In the face of sporadic concern about the human rights situation from some US lawmakers, Jaishankar foresaw a “prudent return to normalcy” in Kashmir. He also waved off repeated offers of mediation on the issue saying there would be no change in India’s position of 40 years that it is a bilateral matter that brooked no third-party intervention. The external affairs minister will attend a reception on Wednesday in the US Congress to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and the 90th birth anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. The event will also feature House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top-ranking Democratic leader. Following apprehensions and criticism in some quarters about the Modi dispensation being seen as too close to the Trump establishment, New Delhi has been at pains to emphasize that its engagement with US is bipartisan and cuts across party lines.

 Hunger strike by detained J&amp;K leaders over curbs on visits by kin | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: A decision to restrict family members from meeting mainstream political leaders in detention in Jammu and Kashmir was revoked this week after around 30 of those lodged at Srinagar's Centaur Lake View Hotel went on a hunger strike, sources said. The detained leaders, most of them mid-level functionaries of the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party and People's Conference, called off their protest after senior officials gave an assurance that family members would be allowed to visit them on all days. The administration had previously allowed visits by family members twice a week. The hunger strike was reportedly triggered by the rule being tweaked to restrict bi-weekly visits to ""blood relations"". While officials have yet to put a number to the detentions in J&K since Article 370 was nullified on August 5, it is estimated that around 400 people have been lodged in makeshift jails after being booked under various laws, including the Public Safety Act (PSA). Three former chief ministers — Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti — remain in detention. Farooq's detention is under the PSA, which empowers the administration to hold him without trial for up to two years. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" India's stand clear on Kashmir, won't accept third party mediation: Jaishankar | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: Categorically rejecting any scope for third party mediation between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has said India's stand has been clear for decades and the two countries can discuss the issue bilaterally. Indian diplomat refuses to comment on Trump's mediation offer on J&amp;K, says 'wait' for bilateral meetJaishankar arrived here on Sunday night from New York after attending the annual General Assembly session of the United Nations along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, the two leaders held bilateral meetings with dozens of world leaders. ""India has been clear for 40 odd years that we would not accept mediation... and that whatever has to be discussed has to be discussed bilaterally,"" Jaishankar told a group of Indian reporters on Tuesday when asked about US President Donald Trump's mediation remarks on Kashmir. Trump   in the recent past has offered mediation   between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue. ""I'm clear in my mind as far as I'm concerned. That's what it's about. My point is very simple. Whose issue (is this?). Mine. Who has to take the call? Me. If it is my issue and I have to take the call; I will decide whether I want somebody's mediation or not. You can offer anything you like, but if I decide it is not relevant to me then it does not happen,"" Jaishankar said. ""I am very clear in my mind. When people speak of it has gone up and down, where has it gone up and down? India has been very clear about it,"" he said when asked about the frequent offer of mediation by President Trump. The External Affairs Minister said in half of his meetings on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, the issue of recent developments in Jammu and Kashmir popped up. ""In terms of (issue of) Article 370, I would find it hard to quantify, but I would say may be in about half my meetings it came up and may be in half of my meetings it didn't come up. It wasn't that every guy who came to me came with that burning question,"" he said. Frankly, most of them were focused on the bilateral relations, he said, adding that even those who raised it, it was not necessarily the first issue of interest to them. ""I think in the case of people who showed interest, it was more like, we have read about developments on Kashmir and it would be useful for us to hear from you,"" he said. Jaishankar said he apprised the leaders about what was happening and why it was happening in Kashmir. The External Affairs Minister said that in many cases a lot of what he said was new to them. ""When you explain to them that Article 370 was temporary, when you tell them that it was part of the Constitution of India in which delegates from Jammu and Kashmir also took part, when you tell them that there was a provision within the Article for the modification which took place, and you explain to them that today major source of concern was the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is really not aligned with the rest of India on a whole set of issues and so therefore, how do you really run a country where one large state is misaligned with rest of the country. ""It's a very basic governance issue which people have ducked in the past. But because they ducked in the past doesn't mean that everybody keeps ducking in the future. I think, once you walked them (world leaders) through this, most of them understood it and got it,"" he said. When specifically asked about the position of two countries – Malaysia and Turkey – on Kashmir, the minister said ""obviously they have been given an understanding which clearly is very different from the facts on the ground"". Prime Minister Modi and Jaishankar's meeting came against the backdrop of the Indian government revoking the special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcating the state into two Union Territories on August 5. Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after India abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, evoking strong reactions from Pakistan. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was an internal matter and also advised Pakistan to accept the reality.

 SC to hear from November 14 pleas challenging constitutional validity of abrogation of Article 370 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday fixed November 14 to commence hearing on a batch of pleas challenging constitutional validity of the Centre's decision to abrogate the provisions of Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The apex court at the same time rejected the plea that there was a need for status quo as the state of Jammu and Kashmir would be bifurcated into two Union Territories on October 31. ""If the petitions are allowed, can't the clock be put back,"" said a 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice N V Ramana. The top court also refused the plea of the petitioners that the Centre and the Jammu and Kashmir administration should not be given more than two weeks to file their counter affidavits. It allowed four weeks to the Centre and the J&K administration to file counter-affidavits on the petitions and also put an embargo on filing of any fresh writ petition challenging the constitutional validity on abrogation of Article 370. The bench said that it has to give a ""reasonable time"" to the Centre and J&K administration to file their affidavits as it is necessary that pleadings are completed so that the hearing could commence. ""We have to allow the Centre and the J&K administration to file counter-affidavit otherwise we can't decide the matter,"" said the bench, also comprising justices S K Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant. The top court said that after filing of the counter affidavits, the petitioners would file replies on them within a week thereafter. ""We can't have an unending process of filing of writ petitions in the matter. Whatever has been filed, has already been filed. It (filing of fresh petitions) must stop,"" the bench said, adding, ""We have to give them (Centre and J&K) reasonable time to file their counters."" The bench also told advocates representing the petitioners raising objections to Attorney General K K Venugopal, seeking four weeks to file counter affidavit, that ""it is unreasonable to think that any decision or order will be passed before October 31"". The petitioners submitted that under the new legislation, J&K would become two separate UTs on October 31 and thus there was a need for an urgent hearing as also granting status quo. Venugopal, who was appearing for the Centre, and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and advocate Shashi Juneja, representing J&K, submitted that they needed four weeks to file counter affidavits to 10 writ petitions and averments are different in each of them as the time frame sought by them was ""realistic"". When senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for one of the petitioners, raised objection to the submissions of the top law officers, the bench said, ""In this type of matter, how can we proceed without counter affidavits being filed?"" While refusing the petitioners' submission that the Centre and J&K would have filed their replies in pursuance of the August 28 hearing, the bench said, ""We have to allow government to file the counter affidavits"". When the petitioners' counsels were insisting that enough time was with the Centre and J&K to file counter affidavits, the bench said, ""In these matters, we cannot go ahead without the filing of counter affidavits."" At the outset, the hearing witnessed raking up of writ petitions filed before the Centre decided to scrap provisions of Article 370 on August 5. Some of the petitioners said that they have filed pleas challenging the existence of provisions of Articles 370 and 35-A according special status to J&K before the Centre came out with the decision to abrogate them. The bench called registrar (judicial) Surya Pratap Singh and asked him to verify pending petitions on the subject and inform it. When some of the advocates sought intervention in the matter, the bench said, ""If everybody wants to file writ petitions, there will be one lakh petitions. It will not work. Please don't try to do this. This will unnecessarily delay the matter"". The bench also pulled up advocate M L Sharma, who was first to file the writ petition, a day after the Centre's decision. The bench said there was nothing in his petition and it was without any substance or ground. ""You played the fastest finger first. That does not mean that you will be heard first. There is certainly nothing in your writ petition but because you came within 72 hours of the Centre's decision, does it mean we have to hear you first,"" the bench told Sharma. Several political parties including the National Conference (NC), the Sajjad Lone-led J&K Peoples Conference and CPI (M) leader Mohd Yousuf Tarigami have filed pleas, challenging Centre's August 5 decision. The petition on behalf of NC was filed by Lok Sabha MPs Mohammad Akbar Lone and Justice (retd) Hasnain Masoodi. In 2015, Justice (retd) Masoodi had ruled that Article 370 was a permanent feature of the Constitution. A plea was also filed by a group of former defence officers and bureaucrats — professor Radha Kumar, ex-member of Home Ministry's Group of Interlocutors for J&K (2010-11), former J&K cadre IAS officer Hindal Haidar Tyabji, Air Vice Marshal (retd) Kapil Kak, Major Gen.

 SC asks Centre to file reply on Sitaram Yechury's habeas corpus petition | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to file a reply on the habeas corpus petition moved by CPM leader Sitaram Yechury for party leader Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami. Habeas corpus petition seeks a person under arrest to be brought before a court, especially to secure their release, unless lawful grounds are shown for their detention. During the course of proceedings, the apex court observed that with the production of Tarigami before the court last month, there is no urgency left in the matter. ""He himself came before this court (as Tarigami has filed a plea before the top court against abrogation of Article 370), where is he missing now?"" said the court. Raju Ramchandran, a counsel appearing for Yechury, challenged the validity of Tarigami's detention today, on which the court said that it would come up in due course. It suggested that the matter should be heard by the Jammu and Kashmir high court. ""If we pass these orders it will be as if High Court is not functioning. If you want it to be heard here, it will not be taken up immediately. Let it come in due course,"" the bench said. The court had last month allowed Yechury to visit Jammu and Kashmir to meet ailing Tarigami and asked him to file an affidavit on his return. Taking cognizance of the affidavit, the court had also ordered Tarigami to be shifted to All Indian Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS). Yechury filed the petition after the central government's diluted the provisions under Article 370, which led to the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special constitutional status. Following the decision, several political leaders including former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti were taken into preventive custody.

Maharashtra Elections 2019: BJP and Sena seal 162-126 seat deal | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: BJP will contest 162 seats and the Shiv Sena 126, according to the seat-sharing formula for the October 21 assembly elections finalized by the alliance partners on Monday. TOI was the first to report these numbers on September 20. The BJP will give seats from its own quota to smaller allies such as the RPI (Athavale group), the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, Shiv Sangram and Rayat Kranti, it is learnt. This means the Sena’s insistence on a 50-50 formula, with the two saffron partners getting 144 seats each of the total 288, has been junked, and its junking has been accepted by Uddhav Thackeray’s party. The saffron allies had contested the 2014 state polls separately, with the BJP winning 122 seats and the Sena 63. However, the Sena, after having been part of the Devendra Fadnavis government in the state, bargained hard for parity. The BJP though has kept the senior partner tag it snatched from the Sena in 2014, in the wake of its thumping win in this year’s Lok Sabha polls and the nullifying of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Sources said the Sena’s quota includes seats such as Mankhurd, Mulund, Byculla, Mumbadevi, Malegaon, Bhiwandi and perhaps Aurangabad Central, which are supposed to be tough to win for the saffron allies given the large concentration of the minority communities in these areas. Earlier in the evening, the BJP and Sena issued a joint press statement formally announcing the alliance, though no official declaration of the seat-sharing formula was made. The joint statement was signed by state BJP president Chandrakant Patil and senior Sena minister Subhash Desai. The seat-sharing formula will be announced “at the earliest,” the statement said. The cryptic, semi-bureaucratic tone of the Patil-Desai communique was in sharp contrast with the fanfare of the 1990s, when Balasaheb Thackeray and Pramod Mahajan would announce a joint list of candidates at a press conference with elan, and peppered with the Sena patriarch’s stunning one-liners, observers said. Sources in the BJP said the ongoing delay in okaying the final list was a deliberate move by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to leave little time and scope for rebels to play their cards. BJP-Sena strategists are worried that a formal announcement of party candidates in advance may trigger rebellion and even defections. Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray held parleys with senior party colleagues at Matoshree amid talk that the BJP would not accept Matoshree’s 50-50 seat-sharing formula. Fadnavis was in New Delhi for two days to consult the BJP high command on the alliance with the Sena and the final list of party candidates. He attended the BJP’s Parliamentary board meeting with a couple of state BJP leaders in tow. The BJP is reportedly ready to offer the deputy CM’s post to Aaditya Thackeray in a bid to assuage the Sena, which is finding it tough to accept its No. 2 position in the alliance, sources said. Sources added that the BJP may compensate the Sena by giving it two or three seats in the legislative council. “In the 1990s, the BJP would be pleading with Balasaheb for more seats. Twenty years later, it’s the Sena which is at the BJP’s mercy,” said a Sena veteran. Aaditya Thackeray will contest from Worli, the central Mumbai fiefdom of Sachin Ahir who recently snapped ties with the NCP to join the Sena. Ahir is likely to be given a berth in the state legislative council next year, it is learnt. The joint BJP-Sena statement said, “In the last five years, the Mahayuti worked together under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis and the guidance of Uddhav Thackeray and is now once again going in for another state election. Through joint discussions, Thackeray, Fadnavis and other leaders of the allied parties have unanimously decided to have an alliance. Thus, the Mahayuti is being announced.” At the BJP state headquarters, Patil said the list of candidates will be announced in New Delhi, and the forms A and B for nominations have already been sent to homes of candidates.

 Jaishankar questions bids to 'hyphenate' India with Pakistan | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: Questioning bids to ""hyphenate"" India with Pakistan following nullification of Article 370, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday said it is being done by those who are obsessed with the post-August 5 developments in Jammu and Kashmir. “You are really being very semantic about it. How do you hyphenate a country, which is one-eighth of your economic size…, which is 'reputationally' your exact opposite?” Jaishankar told a group of Indian reporters, virtually taking exceptions to India and Pakistan being talked of in the same breath. The external affairs minister was responding to a query about India and Pakistan being ""hyphenated"" once again following abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir special status after nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution. By that logic then, India should not do anything which would bring Pakistan into the conversation at all, he said. “So, let's not talk Afghanistan. In fact, let's not talk South Asia. So, my sense is people are over obsessed about it,” he said. “Often the argumentation comes from people who have a viewpoint that we shouldn't have done anything about (Article) 370,” Jaishankar said, adding he has a “very little tolerance” for that.

He was speaking at a function to mark the 27th anniversary of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) raising, held at Ahmedabad on Monday. “The sacrifice of thousands of jawans seemed to be asking us to create an atmosphere of permanent peace in Kashmir. I believe the real tribute for the close to 35,000 jawans who have been martyred has been done by PM Narendra Modi abrogating Articles 370 and 35(A),” Shah said, after handing over medals to the families of soldiers killed in the line of duty. Commending the RAF, Shah said the force has met and exceeded all the expectations with which it was set up. “It has been noticed that the arrival of RAF personnel at a riot scene quickly improves the situation on the ground. In many cases, the presence of RAF has even prevented riots,” the home minister said. The Union home minister presided over an impressive parade of RAF personnel and a showing of the RAF dog squad, besides a cultural show, amid a downpour. National police memorial logo to be dedicated on October 31Union home minister Amit Shah in Ahmedabad on Monday said that the logo of the national police memorial will be unveiled by PM Narendra Modi on October 31. The national police memorial has been erected in Delhi to mark the ultimate sacrifice of more than 38,000 police personnel.

 SC bench to start hearing Article 370 pleas from today | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court will start hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the Centre’s decision to nullify Article 370, leading to abrogation of special status to J&K, from Tuesday. A bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde and S Abdul Nazeer on Monday referred all pending petitions, which questioned the Centre’s decision to annul special status to J&K, clamp down on mobile phone and internet services as well as put almost all noted politicians under preventive detention, to what it termed the ‘Kashmir bench’. MDMK leader Vaiko’s petition seeking to know the whereabouts of NC leader Farooq Abdullah was dismissed. The SC said since it was now known that Abdullah has been detained under the Public Safety Act, Vaiko’s petition was no longer maintainable. It said those aggrieved by the detention could move the appropriate forum.

 Article 370 denied fundamental rights to J&amp;K residents: Ram Madhav | India News - Times of India,"AURANGABAD: When in force, Article 370 of the Constitution denied fundamental rights to Jammu and Kashmir residents and the controversial provision was revoked in a ""democratic"" manner by the Modi government, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said on Monday. When the issue came for discussion in the 1950s, the entire Congress Working Committee expressed opposition to the proposal to give special status to Jammu and Kashmir, he said. However, then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru pushed for the provision and CWC members had to agree for special status for Jammu and Kashmir, he said at a lecture organised by the Rashtriya Ekta Abhiyan here in Maharashtra. Nehru had asked Sardar Patel, the then Home Minister, to intervene in the matter and seek the CWC's support for Article 370, the BJP leader claimed. Opposition leaders and others who are criticising nullification of Article 370, which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir, should explain whether its provisions were implemented in a democratic manner, he said. Courage was needed to revoke Article 370 which the Congress could not display, the BJP leader said, adding the provision was tinkered with as many as 45 times by constitutional method all these years. ""Abolition of Article 370 was on our agenda for five decades, we stuck to it and we did it in a democratic manner,"" Madhav said. ""Residents of Kashmir were deprived of all those fundamental rights which are enjoyed by every countryman since January 26, 1950 (when the Constitution came into force). ""If there would have been Article 370 here in Aurangabad, it would never have been an industrial city. No big investment came to J&K since 1950s and Article 370 was a key hurdle to it,"" Madhav said. People advocating human rights talk about injustice when the Internet was shutdown in the Valley, he said. ""But where were these people when Article 370 denied reservations to Scheduled Tribes in the state, when women of J&K were deprived from marrying non-Kashmiri men,"" Madhav asked. The BJP leader criticised AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi, saying he was given full chance to speak in Parliament when revocation of Article 370 was being debated in early August. ""Why he is still thinking that our way to abolish Article 370 was incorrect. We detained almost 2,500 people in the Valley. Only 200 of them are under detention now and all amenities are being provided to them,"" Madhav said. ""Very few areas have restrictions now. The government will normalise the situation there as early as possible,"" the BJP leader said. ""In 1994, a unanimous decision was taken that the only point left to discuss with Pakistan is when they will handover illegally occupied Kashmir (PoK) to India and there was a Congress government in the country at that time. ""Leaders of opposition are unable to recollect it, they should peep into history,"" Madhav said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 5-judge Constitution bench to hear from Tuesday pleas challenging abrogation of Article 370 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A 5-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court is all set to commence on Tuesday the crucial hearing on the challenge mounted to the legal validity of the Centre's abrogation of the provision of Article 370 which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi on Saturday had set up the Constitution bench of justices N V Ramana, S K Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant to commence hearing on a batch of petitions challenging the scrapping of provisions of Article 370. It was decided on August 28 to refer them to a larger bench. A bench headed by the CJI, which on Monday dealt with other related petitions concerning the issues arising after the constitutional changes were brought in Jammu and Kashmir, said all such matters would now be adjudicated upon by a 3-judge bench headed by Justice Ramana. Several pleas have been filed in the top court challenging the Centre's August 5 decision abrogating provisions of Article 370 and bifurcating the state into Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The UTs will come into being on October 31. Advocate M L Sharma became the first petitioner in the case when he filed a petition in the apex court on August 6 challenging the Presidential order on Article 370. Later, several political parties including the National Conference (NC), the Sajjad Lone-led J&K Peoples Conference and CPM leader Mohd Yousuf Tarigami have filed pleas in this regard in the top court. The petition on behalf of NC was filed by Lok Sabha MPs Mohammad Akbar Lone and Justice (retd) Hasnain Masoodi. Lone is a former speaker of the J&K Assembly and Masoodi is a retired judge of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. In 2015, Justice (retd) Masoodi had ruled that Article 370 was a permanent feature of the Constitution. Other pleas include the one filed by a group of former defence officers and bureaucrats. They have also sought directions declaring the presidential orders of August 5 ""unconstitutional, void and inoperative"". The plea was filed by professor Radha Kumar, a former member of the Home Ministry's Group of Interlocutors for Jammu and Kashmir (2010-11), former IAS officer of J&K cadre Hindal Haidar Tyabji, Air Vice Marshal (retd) Kapil Kak, Major General (retd) Ashok Kumar Mehta, former Punjab-cadre IAS officer Amitabha Pande and former Kerala-cadre IAS officer Gopal Pillai, who retired as the Union home secretary in 2011. A plea has also been filed by bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faesal, along with his party colleague and former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) leader Shehla Rashid. During the hearing on Monday, the bench, also comprising Justices S A Bobde and S A Nazeer, said it has received a report from the Juvenile Justice Committee of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court on the allegations about illegal detention of minors in the Valley. ""The report has come. We will send this matter to the Kashmir bench (a three-judge bench headed by Justice Ramana),"" the bench told the lawyer representing petitioners and child right activists Enakshi Ganguly and Shanta Sinha. It also referred to the three-judge bench a separate plea filed by a doctor who claimed shortage of medical facilities in Kashmir due to the restrictions imposed there and also about restoration of internet facilities in the hospitals there. The bench said that petition filed by Executive Editor of Kashmir Times Anuradha Bhasin, who has raised the issue of restrictions imposed on working of journalists in Kashmir following the abrogation of provisions of Article 370, would be heard by the three-judge bench. It also referred the separate petitions, including those filed by CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, to the three-judge bench. While Yechury has filed a petition seeking permission to visit his party colleague Yousuf Tarigami in Kashmir, Azad has moved the top court in his personal capacity seeking its nod to visit his family members and relatives in Kashmir. The apex court had earlier allowed Yechury to visit Kashmir to meet Tarigami while Azad was also permitted to visit four districts - Srinagar, Jammu, Baramulla, Anantnag - to meet people. Other pleas, which would be taken up for hearing by the Constitution bench, include the one filed by a group of former defence officers and bureaucrats who have sought direction to declare the Presidential orders of August 5 ""unconstitutional, void and inoperative"". The plea was filed by professor Radha Kumar, a former member of the Home Ministry's Group of Interlocutors for Jammu and Kashmir (2010-11), former IAS officer of J&K cadre Hindal Haidar Tyabji, Air Vice Marshal (retd) Kapil Kak, Major General (retd) Ashok Kumar Mehta, former Punjab-cadre IAS officer Amitabha Pande and former Kerala-cadre IAS officer Gopal Pillai, who retired as the Union home secretary in 2011. The NC leaders have submitted that the Presidential Orders paved the way for application of entire provisions of the Constitution in Jammu and Kashmir and also have the effect of nullifying Article 35A and completely abrogating Article 370. They have contended that the Presidential Orders and the new legislation unconstitutionally undermine the scheme of Article 370. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Hitting out at the government for abrogating Article 370 provisions that gave special status to the state, he said all sections of society in Jammu and Kashmir have been affected by the laws passed by the Indian government as business has come down to ""zero"". Azad alleged that he was not allowed to visit many places during his six-day tour and all those who visited him were videographed. ""Government tried to make sure that people are not able to meet me,"" he claimed. He also alleged that the government was ""using local government"" for repression. The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister rejected the government's claims that all restrictions have been removed and said normal life is crippled. Azad demanded that lakhs of people working on daily wages should be given free food items for six months. His visit became possible after the Supreme Court on September 16 allowed him to tour the state. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, had allowed the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha to visit four districts -- Srinagar, Jammu, Baramulla, Anantnag -- to meet people. In his petition filed in his ""personal capacity"", Azad had told the Supreme Court that he had tried to visit the state thrice, but was turned back from the airport.

 Nadda accuses Opposition of 'confusing' people on Art 370 | India News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: BJP's national working president J P Nadda here on Monday said Article 370 was a temporary provision in the Constitution and blamed the Abdullah family, late PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad for ""confusing"" people about the special status to Jammu and Kashmir. ""First Sheikh Abdullah, later Farooq Abdullah, and Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, then Omar Abdullah and Ghulam Nabi Azad used to say there is a special status to Jammu and Kashmir. They confused the world. It is not a special status,"" Nadda said while addressing a public meeting organised by the Chandigarh unit of BJP here. Nadda asserted that the special status to J-K was temporary and transitional. ""From the very beginning, Article 370 was temporary and transitional,"" Nadda said, adding that there was no takers for the provision. He lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minsiter Amit Shah for the scrapping of the special status. ""The abrogation of Article 370 became possible because of Modi's will power and Amit Shah's strategy,"" said Nadda. He said with the removal of the provision, Jammu and Kashmir had been fully integrated into India and now all 104 Indian laws would be implemented in the newly-carved union territory.

"Yasin Malik: Home Ministry set to sanction prosecution of Yasin Malik, Asiya Andrabi and Masarat Alam under UAPA | India News - Times of India","(This story originally appeared in  on Sep 30, 2019)NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry is set to sanction the prosecution of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chairman Yasin Malik, Dukhtaran-e-Millat chief Asiya Andrabi and All Party Hurriyat Conference general secretary Masarat Alam under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly receiving funds from Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities and stone pelting in 2010 and 2016. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which arrested the three in April, is expected to file a charge sheet in the first week of October after obtaining the sanction, said officials. The charge sheet may also name Pakistan-based Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, they said. The development comes months after the central government rendered Article 370 inoperative and bifurcated the state into two Union territories. The political leadership, including separatist leaders, have either been locked up or are under house arrest at various locations. Second-rung politicians have been kept outside the state. Malik, Andrabi, Alam and Shabir Shah are currently in Tihar jail in Delhi. Central government approval is mandatory under Section 45 of the UAPA. The NIA’s proposal for sanction will be examined by a two-member authority. Under the UAPA Act, the central government needs to consider the report of the authority before giving its sanction. Sources said the sanction is likely to be cleared by next week, failing which the separatist leaders will be liable for bail. In its first charge sheet filed last year, the agency named former Hurriyat chief’s son-in-law Altaf Fantosh, Kashmiri businessman Zahoor Ahmed Shah Watali, Naeem Khan, Raja Mehrajudin Kalwal, Bashir Ahmed Bhat, alias Peer Saifullah, Aftab Hilali Shah, alias Shahid ul Islam, Farooq Ahmed Dar, alias Bitta Karate, Mohammad Akbar Khandey, alias Ayaz Akbar and Javed Ahmed Bhat, among others. The supplementary charge sheet against Malik and others will cite diaries pertaining to contacts of hawala operators, traders, ledger books containing accounts of cross-border Line of Control (LoC) trade of various trading companies, details of bank accounts of Jammu and Kashmir, and travel documents of some entities showing their visits to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The NIA had registered the case in May 2017 against separatist and secessionist leaders. It said the first information report (FIR) was also against the cadres of the Hurriyat Conference, who were acting in connivance with active militants of proscribed terrorist organisations Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), Dukhtarane Millat, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and other terrorist organisations and gangs for raising, receiving and collecting funds through various illegal means, including hawala, for funding separatist and terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir and for causing disruption in the Kashmir Valley by way of pelting stones at the security forces, burning schools, damaging public property and waging war against India.

BJP slams Congress over its stand on Art 370 | Mangaluru News - Times of India,"MANGALURU: BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao lashed out at the Congress for opposing and spreading ‘misinformation’ on abrogation of Article 370. He said people belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and other backward communities (OBC) in Jammu and Kashmir were deprived of their rights when it came to reservation in government jobs and education because of the Article 370. “However, Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders continue to oppose the abrogation of Article 370,” Rao said, addressing party workers at an awareness programme on abrogation of Article 370 on Sunday. “Why can’t the people Jammu and Kashmir live without Article 370, when the majority of the people in the rest of the states are living well, though it is not in force? When Muslims across the nation can protect their religion without Article 370, why can’t they do so in Kashmir? The Congress is trying to communalise the abrogation of Article 370. Initially, Congress said the Article 370 for Jammu and Kashmir was temporary, but now when the BJP government nullified it, they are opposing it. The Congress and the Communists have been spreading misinformation about Article 370 and its abrogation by the BJP government. In fact, it was because of the Article 370, that SCs/ STs and OBCs, including a section of Muslims, were deprived of their rights to get reservation in government jobs and education,” Rao said. “By criticising the BJP government for abrogating Article 370, the Congress has been helping Pakistan, instead of standing united for India,” he said. “Compared to the last 70 years, today violence has come down. Slowly things are coming back to normal in Jammu and Kashmir. The prime minister has assured that the language, culture and religion of the people there will be fully protected,” he added.

The steps taken by the government will bring ever- lasting peace in Jammu and Kashmir and enable it to head towards development, Shah said here after inspecting a parade of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) on its 27th Raising Day. ""I believe that Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid the most befitting tribute to 35,000 martyred jawans (in Kashmir) by abrogating Articles 370 and 35A,"" he said. ""The situation was such that our jawans were losing their lives in Jammu and Kashmir for so many years. This situation was there for 70 years, but nobody had the courage or even paid attention to rectify the situation,"" he said. Shah thanked Modi for the decision to abrogate Article 370 from the ""stage of CRPF"" (whose personnel are deployed in Kashmir). ""I want to assure people of Kashmir and India that Jammu and Kashmir will walk on the path of development. Our forces will take care of those who will try to disturb peace in Kashmir. This move will bring everlasting peace,"" he said. Shah was the chief guest at the 27th Raising Day event of the RAF at its battalion number 100 based in Ahmedabad's Vastral area. The RAF is a specialised anti-riot and crowd control unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the country's largest paramilitary force comprising over 3.25 lakh personnel in its ranks. The Home minister also gave 20 gallantry medals to CRPF personnel, including some posthumously, for exhibiting bravery in counter-terrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir and anti-naxalite operations in various states. This is the first time Shah attended an event of the RAF post the August 5 decision of the Centre to abrogate Article 370 provisions that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The CRPF is the lead force deployed in the Kashmir region post this decision and at present, nearly 1.5 lakh of its personnel are there for conducting counter-terrorism operations and rendering regular law and order duties. The RAF Raising Day is on October 7, the day it became operational in 1992, but the event was rescheduled to Monday owing to some commitments of the Union home minister.

"Bipin Rawat: It’s no longer going to be hide and seek, if we have to go across LoC, we will | India News - Times of India","Pakistan has reactivated the Balakot terror facility but Army chief General Bipin Rawat tells TOI India is very clear that it will not allow Pakistan to vitiate the atmosphere in J&K any longer. Excerpts:The JeM facility in Balakot has been reactivated. Intelligence assessments say there are 250, 300 or 500 terrorists waiting to infiltrate into India. If so, what did the Balakot air strikes in February, or the surgical strikes in September 2016 achieve?The strikes have delivered the message that the Line of Control (LoC) will remain sacrosanct as long as the other side remains quiet and does not vitiate the atmosphere. Pakistan controls the terrorists, who act as its proxies. It’s no longer going to be hide and seek. If we have to go across, we will, through the air or the ground route or both. The red line has been very clearly drawn as to what will be the future course of action. Terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot reactivated, Army chief General Bipin Rawat saysWhat is your assessment of the terror infrastructure in Pakistan in terms of camps and support from the ISI-Pak army combine?It’s intact. They kept on saying we don’t support terrorists despite India giving them so much evidence. Now, after August 5 (   nullification of Article 370   ), haven’t they openly said let’s go for jihad in Kashmir. It’s a tacit acceptance of their support to terrorism in J&K. You cannot develop this kind of a machinery to spread terrorism overnight… It was always there. There are terror training camps in Pakistan, though they keep on shifting them. Fighting a proxy war with us is the state policy of Pakistan. Pakistan often threatens the use of nuclear weapons, with PM Imran Khan raising the prospect of a nuclear conflagration at UNGA.Nuclear weapons are weapons of deterrence. They are not weapons for war fighting. I find it difficult to comprehend when someone proclaims he will use them for conventional war fighting or if he is attacked. Will the world community ever allow you to use nuclear weapons like this? Pakistan’s statements show an   inappropriate understanding   of the employment of strategic weapons. What about the situation along the LoC and IB?There has been a step-up in infiltration attempts after August 5. There is currently a leadership void among terror outfits in the Valley. Pakistan is desperate to send some people across to instigate youngsters to spread violence again. But we are ensuring terrorists are not able to come into our territory by targeting any suspicious movement or reconnaissance mission on the other side of the LoC through shelling. Our aim is to prevent infiltration to ensure Kashmir remains peaceful. There is apprehension the situation will explode in Kashmir after the ongoing security clampdown and communication blockade is lifted?A large number of people in J&K have come to realise that what happened has happened for the good. There is, of course, another section trying to create propaganda that the rights of Kashmiris have been taken away. If the people analyse carefully, understand the pros and cons, they will find they have gained much more and hardly lost anything. They are still Kashmiris, they are still residents of J&K. They can come to other parts of India and continue to do what they were doing. Kashmiri students are studying in different parts of the country. They have freedom of movement. Similarly, why should people from other parts of India not have freedom of movement and anything else that goes with it? Kashmir is not just the Valley. There are people outside the Valley. Only a very small part of the state has been, if at all, affected. They should give peace a chance after what they have seen for the last 30 years. People say situation has become bad. Do they mean the situation in the past 30 years was good? I think the past 30 years were bad and the past two months have been good. What is this clampdown? Has anybody been told to stay confined to his house? Has somebody debarred students from going to schools? Have schools been closed? Have security forces opened fire? As I keep on saying, people are coming out and working in orchards. But there are reports of thousands of youths being detained in Kashmir.It is like this. Some people were being detained if they were violating Section 144 (unlawful assembly), throwing stones, indulging in arson, putting up posters to threaten apple growers and others. They were trying to vitiate the atmosphere and disrupt the government’s efforts — like the procurement of apples through Nafed — to ensure people don’t suffer economically. Actually, the clampdown is being forced by the other side, not by the security forces. The security forces are only trying to ensure that people don’t come out in numbers and resort to arson, looting and violence. Many of those detained have been released after being checked by the police.

" Congress says in ‘complete agreement’ with govt stand on Pakistan, terror | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: In a rare show of solidarity with PM Narendra Modi and his government, Congress on Sunday said it was in “complete agreement” with the stand taken by the government on Pakistan and the continuing threat of terrorism. “We congratulate the PM for reiterating India’s firm and consistent position that the state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and its accession is final and irrevocable. We endorse the official position that all issues pertaining to Jammu and Kashmir are India’s internal affairs and there is no question of any third party meddling,” senior Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said. Charged with being “anti-national” and “pro-Pakistan” on the issue of abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, Congress came out more aggressively in its attack on the neighbour on Sunday. It condemned the “provocative and preposterous statement” made by Pakistani PM Imran Khan at the UNGA, which Sharma said was aimed at “misleading international opinion using falsehood and fabrication of facts to defame India”. “The language of Pakistan PM was unbecoming of a prime minister and has no place in any civilised discourse,” he added. The strong Congress comment came as Pakistan yet again slammed the Modi government for scratching J&K’s special status and even cited a “Congress home minister” to say that RSS camps were used to train terrorists. Pakistan’s continued focus on Kashmir creates complications for Congress and other political parties who have come down heavily on the Centre for abrogation of Article 370. The situation fits the BJP gameplan to claim a convergence between its domestic political rivals and the recalcitrant neighbour. Earlier, Pakistan had cited Rahul Gandhi’s critical comments in its petition on Kashmir to the UN, and the move was seized by BJP, led by home minister Amit Shah, to allege that his stand was helping the enemy nation. There is a realisation in Congress that Kashmir presents a tricky turf given Pakistan’s interest in it and BJP’s “sly political campaign”. But senior party managers say their stand is based on “national interest” and it can do little about extraneous factors. It is because of this political trap, coupled with strong public sentiment over Kashmir in the country, that many Congress leaders chose to break from the party stance and came out in open support of abrogation of Article 370. However, after much brainstorming within, which included a session of the Congress Working Committee, the leadership decided to stick to its stand and to keep questioning the Centre about the lockdown imposed in Kashmir.

 Nehru approaching UN on J&amp;K was Himalayan blunder: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said there are no restrictions in the Kashmir Valley now and the entire world has supported the move to abrogate the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370. Shah asserted that Jammu and Kashmir will be the most developed region in the country in the next 10 years because of the bold step taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 5. The home minister faulted the country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru for approaching the United Nations in 1948 on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir ""In 1948, India went to United Nations. That was a Himalayan blunder. It is more than a Himalayan blunder,"" he said at event organised by Samkalp Former Civil Servants Forum at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) here. The minister accused the opposition of spreading ""misinformation"" about restrictions in the Valley. ""Where are the restrictions? It is only in your mind. There are no restrictions. Only misinformation about restrictions is being spread,"" he said addressing a seminar on national security. Shah said curfew has been lifted in all 196 police stations in Kashmir, and only in eight police stations areas CrPC 144 was imposed where five or more persons cannot gather. ""People are free to move around anywhere in Kashmir. Many journalists from rest of India are also visiting Kashmir regularly,"" he said Referring to the recently concluded United Nations General Assembly session, Shah said all world leaders have supported India's move on Article 370. ""All world leaders had gathered for seven days (in New York). Not a single leader has raised the issue (of Jammu and Kashmir). This is a big diplomatic victory of the Prime Minister,"" he said. The home minister said 41,800 people have lost their lives in the decades-old militancy in Jammu and Kashmir but no one raised the issue of human rights violation of jawans, their widows or the children who were orphaned. ""But people are trying to create hue and cry over lack of mobile connections for few days. Lack of phone connection is not human rights violation,"" he said. Shah also said 10,000 new landline connections were given in Jammu and Kashmir while 6,000 PCOs have also come up in the last two months. ""The decision on Article 370 will strengthen the unity and integrity of India,"" he said, adding the situation in Jammu and Kashmir will be completely normal soon. Shah said there were 631 princely states when India attained independence in 1947 and 630 of them were handled by the then home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and one by Nehru. ""The 630 princely states were merged with the Union of India completely but Jammu and Kashmir remained an issue since 1947,"" he said. The home minister said on October 27, 1947, the Indian Army had reached Kashmir and defeated Pakistani attackers. It was marching towards PoK and they were on the verge of victory. ""But suddenly the then government announced ceasefire. What was the need for announcing the ceasefire when we were about to win the war. Had the ceasefire not declared, PoK would have been part of India now,"" he said. Shah said there have been lots of rumours and misinformation on Article 370 and those are still going on. ""I want to tell you because of Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir had not been fully integrated into India. Because of Article 370, corruption had flourished there,"" he said. The home minister said because of Article 370, ""people always had to say 'Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India'. We don't have to say so when we talk about Karnataka, West Bengal, Gujarat or Delhi."" He said Article 370 has been an issue for the erstwhile Jan Sangh and then the BJP since the beginning. ""We have launched 11 agitations against it and even Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee laid down his life for it. We are the third generation leaders. ""Even Nehru, when he realised the mistakes, kept (former chief minister) Sheikh Abdullah in jail for 11 years. Now, it has not been even two months but people have talked so much,"" he said. Shah also termed the 1987 assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir as a turning point for spread of terrorism that has so far claimed 41,800 lives. ""In that elections, MLAs were elected even with 10 votes. 1987 elections was the root cause of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. Shah, however, praised former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for signing the 'Simla Accord' saying she ensured that Jammu and Kashmir remains a bilateral issue. The home minister rejected the argument that scrapping Article 370 will ""endanger"" Kashmiri culture, noting that regional languages and traditions were flourishing in other states. ""I want to ask those people, is there any threat to Gujarat or its 'Garba' because it does not have Article 370. Is West Bengal or its 'Durga Puja' facing any threat as there is no Article 370 there. Are Karnataka or the Kannada language and Maharashtra or Marathi culture facing threat because there is no Article 370 there,"" he asked. Shah said some people have prevented the culture of Jammu and Kashmir from spread to other parts of the country, whose strength is unity and diversity. The home minister said as many as 106 laws, including right to education, human rights and ban on child marriage were not applicable to Jammu and Kashmir because of Article 370. ""Tell me one benefit which was available due to Article 370. Because of Article 370, corruption has flourished,"" he said. He said Jammu and Kashmir had no Anti Corruption Bureau. ""Those who looted Kashmir did not want Anti Corruption Bureau as they did not want any corrupt to be caught. They used Article 370 as a shield to loot people,"" he said. ""The Prime Minister has finally rooted out the cankering wound ('nasur'). He deserves to be complimented,"" he said.

"Imran Khan:  It is a 'jihad', says Imran on Kashmir after returning from US - Times of India","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on his return from the US on Sunday said that those standing by Kashmiris were doing ""jihad"" and Pakistan will support Kashmiris even if the world does not. Prime Minister Khan, who focused on the Kashmir issue in his maiden address to the UN General Assembly, told his party workers at the airport here that “whether the world is with the Kashmiris or not, we are standing with them.” “It (standing by Kashmiris) is jihad. We are doing it because we want Allah to be happy with us,” he said. “It is a struggle and do not lose heart when the time is not good. Do not be disappointed as the Kashmiris are looking towards you,” he said. He said ""Kashmiris would win if the Pakistani people stood by their side"". Khan on Friday raised the Kashmir issue in his address to the UNGA and demanded that India must lift the ""inhuman curfew"" and release all ""political prisoners"". In his speech that went on for about 50 minutes, far exceeding the 15-minute limit for UN speeches during the General Debate, Khan devoted half of his address to the Kashmir issue, warning that if there's face-off between two nuclear-armed neighbours, the consequences would be far beyond their borders. His war rhetoric was in sharp contrast to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's peace message from the same podium few minutes earlier in which he said India is a country that has ""given the world, not war, but Buddha's message of peace."" Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue after India withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, but New Delhi has asserted the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"".

 Country united after Article 370 revocation: Adityanath | India News - Times of India,"GORAKHPUR: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said the entire country is united after abrogation of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for fulfilling the dreams of the people. Speaking in neighbouring Maharajganj district, Adityanath said, ""After the Independence, it was a dream to have 'one flag, one sovereign head and one Constitution' ('Ek Nishaan, ek pradhaan aur ek vidhaan) and PM Modi has made it true. With abrogation of Article 370, the entire country is now united."" The chief minister said the Uttar Pradesh government is committed to the development of the state. ""I am happy to say that now the benefits of government schemes are reaching to the last man of society without any discrimination,"" he said. Adityanath hailed the law that bans the practice of instant divorce through 'triple talaq' among Muslims. ""After law on triple talaq, Muslim women got happiness and freedom from a bad practice. Now no one could exploit and harass them with triple talaq on mobile phone or through social media,"" he said. The chief minister said, ""Maharajganj district is moving towards development with pace and three nagar panchayats - Farenda, Sonauli and Ghughli of the district - have been brought under Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhaya development scheme and now the process of development in these areas will be speeded up."" Adityanath on Sunday visited Lehra Devi Temple in Maharajganj and Tarkulha Devi temple in Gorakhpur district. During his visit to Maharajganj, he laid foundation stones for various projects and inaugurated cow conservation centre at Harhawa, Ahmadnagar. He said the Tarkulha Devi temple will be renovated with Rs 2.12 crore, and a statue of Bandhu Singh who took on the British in the First War of Independence in 1857 will also be installed. ""There should be a grand programme here to mark the centenary of Chauri Chaura incident,"" the chief minister said, adding that in 2021, Gorakhpur AIIMS will start working with its full capacity and fertilizer plant will also be operational soon.

 Navy's 'second strike capability' most significant as nuclear deterrent: Rajnath Singh | India News - Times of India,"In the backdrop of Pakistan's repeated talk about nuclear war, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Sunday that Indian Navy's ""second strike capability"" as a nuclear deterrent is ""most significant"". ""Second strike capability"" is an assured capability of an armed force to respond to a nuclear attack with its own nuclear weapons. Addressing the Navy personnel on aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, the minister said, ""I am aware that after the Pulwama attack, when the country responded effectively through strikes on terror camps in Balakot, the Western Fleet was immediately deployed in a strong posture in the northern Arabian Sea. ""This degraded the ability of our adversary to deploy and ensured they did not attempt any misadventure at sea. In this context, the role of Indian Navy to have a credible 'second strike' capability as a nuclear deterrent, is most significant."" The defence minister's remarks come just days after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his maiden speech at the UN General Assembly, drummed up hysteria over nuclear war while targeting India over Kashmir. India had hit back saying the ""threat of unleashing nuclear devastation qualifies as brinksmanship, not statesmanship"". Tensions between the two countries have spiked since the abrogation of Article 370 with Pakistani leaders repeatedly raising the nuclear bogey. But India has maintained that it is an internal issue and Islamabad should end all support to terrorist outfits. Singh said Indian Navy's role is critical in ensuring the energy security and economic growth of the country and noted that about 90 per cent of India's international trade by volume and about 70 per cent by value is carried by sea. ""As we move towards our goal of five trillion dollar economy, the volume of maritime trade will only grow in times to come. Thus, I firmly believe that the role of the Indian Navy in general and the Western Fleet in particular is also critical in ensuring the energy security and economic growth of the country,"" he added. The minister said that he will write to family members of each personnel, who are working on INS Vikramaditya, talking about their valour. INS Vikramaditya is currently travelling in Arabian sea somewhere near Goa. ""I was telling Admiral Karambir Singh (Chief of Naval Staff) that since I have met so many personnel here...I would write a letter to either parents and spouse of each personnel, telling them that I met your son or husband at INS Vikramaditya."" ""I will tell them (parents) that your son is full of valour and you have given birth to such a child that the whole country is proud of you and your son. I will go and write to each member of your family,"" the minister added. During his overnight stay on the INS Vikramaditya, Singh witnessed various military exercises involving submarines, frigates and the carrier. The minister said that the government would like that Indian Navy to be known across the world as ""blue water navy"". A blue water navy is capable in operating globally, even in deep ocean waters far away from any coastline. About his overnight stay on the aircraft carrier, the minister said, ""I have been with you since last night. And I have got the opportunity for the first time to stay at INS Vikramaditya. I can say that if there is any ""Samundar Ka Sikandar (king of the seas)"", it is INS Vikramaditya only."" ""Keeping in mind our strategic interest and maritime security, Indian government also believes that the country needs three aircraft carriers. Currently, the work on second one is going on. I think it will be over soon,"" the minister said. The minister's address at INS Vikramaditya was relayed through radio to Navy personnel of 21 ships, which were surrounding the aircraft carrier in Arabian Sea.

Article 370 play during tributes to Bhagat Singh | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"BARNALA: Terming the scrapping of Article 370 and 35A in Jammu and Kashmir as an “act of repression”, left-leaning organizations observed the eighth death anniversary of noted playwright Gursharan Singh as a mark of solidarity with Kashmiris here on Friday night. Playwright Ajmer Singh Aulakh too was remembered during the nightlong observation of the Inquilabi Rangmanch Dihara (revolutionary theatre day). Floral tributes were also paid after midnight to Bhagat Singh on his 112th birth anniversary. Activists also raised slogans to demand pardon for murder convict farm activist Manjit Dhaner. Eminent playwright Gursharan Singh, better known as Bhai Manna Singh, died on August 27, 2011. Every year, Punjab Lok Sabhyacharak Manch holds a nightlong vigil in his memor. The night is used as a stage to raise people’s issues. Gursharan, all through his life, kept on staging plays around people’s problems, mainly in rural areas, and never showed any fear of authorities or even extremist forces. On Friday night, the focus was on Kashmir and agrarian crisis. While one play described the situation in Kashmir, another was on the precarious economic condition of Punjab farmers. Students for Society activist Nikk raised the pitch for the pardon of Manjit Dhaner. Gursharan Singh’ daughter Navsharan Kaur, Ajmer Singh Aulakh’ wife Manjit Kaur, manch president Amolak Singh termed the situation in the country under the present rule as harrowing time for the minorities who are feeling unsafe.

Shah will be the chief guest for the 27th Raising Day event of the RAF at its battalion number 100 based in Ahmedabad's Vastral area. The RAF is part of the CRPF, the country's largest paramilitary force with over 3.25 lakh personnel in its ranks. The home minister will also give away 20 gallantry medals to central reserve police force (CRPF) personnel for exhibiting bravery in counter-terrorist operations in Jammu and Kashmir and anti-naxal operations in various states, the officials said. Shah will take the salute and review the operational preparedness of the blue dungaree-donning RAF before he addresses personnel of the force, they said. This is the first time, Shah will attend an event of the RAF post the August 5 decision of the Centre abrogating Article 370, that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The CRPF is the lead force deployed in the Kashmir region post this decision and at present, it has almost 1.5 lakh personnel there for conducting counter-terrorist operations and rendering regular law and order duties. The RAF raising day is October 7, the day it became operational in 1992, but the event was rescheduled to Monday owing to some commitments of the home minister, officials said.

" With opposition in disarray, BJP eyes poll sweep in Maharashtra | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: The BJP is eyeing to sweep next month's Maharashtra assembly polls and is confident of a second term in office as the opposition NCP and Congress in the state appear to be in disarray, say observers. While the BJP and ally Shiv Sena are yet to announce the seat-sharing pact for the polls, scheduled on October 21, the Amit Shah-led party believes it will be back to power with a thumping majority. The BJP top brass is repeatedly stressing that chief minister Devendra Fadnavis would helm the state once again, but the Shiv Sena wants to project party president Uddhav Thackeray's son Aaditya Thackeray for the top post in the event of the saffron alliance returning to power. The Sena may agree to contest less seats if Aaditya Thackeray, who is likely to make his poll debut next month, is given the deputy chief minister's post, a party source said. ""A section of Sena leaders are, however, uncomfortable with this strategy,"" he added. Making it clear that the abrogation of Article 370 would be the BJP's main poll plank in Maharashtra, Shah last week urged people to show the Congress and NCP their place for ""opposing"" the government's move in Jammu and Kashmir. As part of a pre-poll mass outreach campaign, Fadnavis also recently toured 140 out of the total 288 assembly seats in the state through his 'Mahajanadesh Yatra'. While NCP chief Sharad Pawar has also been touring the state, the Congress appears to be direction-less with there being no 'pan Maharashtra' leader. Many senior leaders from both the parties joined the BJP and Sena in the last few months, a political observer noted. ""There is no clarity about the Congress' vision and direction and transparency in candidate selection,"" he said. The five working presidents appointed along with Balasaheb Thorat as state Congress chief have not been taken into confidence on seat-sharing with the NCP, a source said. ""All five working presidents and Thorat are contesting the upcoming polls and are unable to move out of their respective constituencies,"" he added. The party is also facing criticism over Thorat not travelling across the state to campaign, amid rumours that former chief minister Ashok Chavan is calling the shots behind the curtain. To add to the confusion, the Congress has appointed poll in-charges for the five regions (Vidarbha, Marathwada, Konkan, north Maharashtra and western Maharashtra). ""Most of them don't know what they are supposed to do,""the source said. But, the Congress is putting up a brave front and countering the BJP's move to highlight Article 370 scrapping, saying this election is about Maharashtra and not Kashmir. However, Fadnavis has been blunting the opposition's point, saying what is the harm in speaking about national issues which concern the entire country. ""The Congress hasn't been able to counter the BJP, which is an expert in making an event out of everything, as to how the abrogation of Article 370 will help to wipe out terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir,"" the source said. He said joblessness, slowdown in the economy and farm crisis need to be highlighted during the poll campaign which will gain momentum now. The opposition NCP is also dealing with its own issues, including naming of 78-year-old Sharad Pawar in the Maharashtra State Co-operative (MSC) Bank scam. The Maratha strongman's deft political move to go to the enforcement directorate's (ED) office on Friday to face questioning almost galvanised the party cadres, but the Maharashtra government acted swiftly in enforcing prohibitory orders around the probing agency's office here. Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Barve also persuaded Pawar against going to the ED office since it could lead to law and order problems. Observers feel the slight political point scored by Pawar senior was short-lived as the same day his nephew Ajit Pawar, who is one of the 70 people named in the scam, stunned the NCP by quitting as an MLA. The former state deputy chief minister on Saturday said he resigned as MLA as he was pained after his uncle's name got embroiled in the MSC Bank scam for no reason. However, there have been speculations that all is not well in the Pawar family since the Lok Sabha polls when the party chief initially opposed the candidature of his nephew's son Parth Pawar, but later relented. At the same time, his another grand nephew Rohit Pawar (son of Ajit Pawar's cousin) is being encouraged in the party and is likely to contest the state polls next month. Apart from these four parties, the Prakash Ambedkar- led Vanchit Bahujan Agadhi (VBA), which dented Congress' winning prospects in some seats during the Lok Sabha polls this year, has decided to contest all 288 assembly seats in the state and refused to join the Congress-NCP alliance.

" As Turkey sides with Pakistan, PM Modi meets its rivals | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: In a blunt message to Turkey which has endorsed Pakistan's aggressive stand on J&K, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met leaders of its rivals - Greece, Cyprus and Armenia - before starting for home from the US.  Soon after his address to UN General Assembly, Modi met Nicos Anastasiades, President of Cyprus. Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 and wrested the latter's northern part which was proclaimed to be an independent entity, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  During his meeting with Anastasiades, Modi ""reiterated India's consistent support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Republic of Cyprus"", a position which is certain to infuriate Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who has sided with Pakistan. After Imran’s threat, Modi recalls surgical strikes Modi also met Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of Greece which is locked in a bitter dispute with Turkey over who should control islets in Aegean Sea. Nikol Pashinyan, Prime Minister of Armenia, which holds Turkey responsible for genocide of lakhs of its nationals, was another leader who met Modi.  Senior sources in the government made it clear that the three meetings were designed to send a message to Erdogan about India's resentment and its determination not to brook any opposition to the stand about J&K being an ""internal matter"". The stern message was amplified when India attacked China, another ally of Pakistan, over China -Pakistan Economic Corridor.  The twin retaliations also make it clear that Modi's decision not to mention J&K or Pakistan in his UNGA address has to do with a tactical calculation not to engage in a verbal fracas with Imran Khan. It reflected the confidence of a leader who has emerged stronger after the Lok Sabha polls, the second consecutive win fortifying his conviction about a groundswell for his ""no compromise-on national security"" plank.  The PM highlighted his improved numbers at the   ""Howdy Modi"" event at Houston   , where he also emphasised the two-thirds parliamentary support for his decisions on J&K, and at UNGA-the purpose clearly being to convey unequivocally that the changes in the border state were ""off-limits"" for the international community. Instead of scuffling with Khan, Modi chose to take the higher diplomatic ground focusing on contemporary global concerns like climate change, terrorism and public health. The ""when they go low, we go high"" playbook saw the Prime Minister invoking Gandhi and Buddha and helped his efforts to stay away from the fray personally.  The tactic paid off also because of Imran Khan's rant. Help from Pakistan Prime Minister also came in the form of his reference to the use of ""Hindu terror"" by Sushil Kumar Shinde, Union home minister under UPA. Khan's accusation that the Modi government had ""violated Indian Constitution"" can have repercussions for how Congress proceeds with its opposition to the neutering of Article 370 and the Modi government's handling of the aftermath.

The bench — also comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai and Surya Kant — is scheduled to hear from October 1 over two dozen petitions, which include those filed by Sitaram Yechury (of CPM), Ghulam Nabi Azad (Congress), Mohd Akbar Lone (National Conference), Sajjad Lone (People’s Coference), journalist Anuradha Bhasin, retired district judge Muzzafar Iqbal Khan and several advocates, including M L Sharma (known to file PILs). A five-judge bench led by CJI Gogoi is currently engaged in adjudication of ‘the Ayodhya land dispute’. Given the sheer number of top politician petitioners and their capability to engage the best of the renowned constitutional lawyers to put across their grievances against abrogation of special status to J&K as well as scrapping of Article 35A that gave exclusive rights to Kashmiris, the length of arguments could well match the period taken by the Ayodhya land dispute, which has completed 33 hearing days and still continuing. The CJI has also decided to set up three more special benches. One three-judge bench will exclusively hear pending appeals challenging death penalties imposed on persons convicted in heinous crimes. All these cases, in which the SC has stayed HC orders either upholding or awarding death penalties to the accused, have been pending for sometime. CJI Gogoi also earmarked two 2-judge benches to exclusively deal with the tax matters from October 1. CBITC informed the SC that it has “initiated several steps to reduce litigation, most notable of which is by increasing the monetary limit of filing appeals in the SC to Rs two crore, with effect from August 22, 2019”. Setting up of two Constitution benches of five-judge each is a rare phenomenon in the highest constitutional court, which for years had been struggling to keep pace with the spiralling number of fresh cases, mostly mundane appeals, that had made it difficult for it to give priority to adjudication of cases involving important constitutional questions and interpretation of law. But with the Centre acceding to his request and increasing sanctioned strength of SC judges to 34, CJI Gogoi had the room to manoeuvre and set up a Constitution bench to hear petitions raising Article 370-related issues. Thus, from October 1, 10 judges will be dealing with two important issues — ownership dispute over 2.77-acre Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land and Article 370-related issues. In setting up a bench to exclusively deal with tax disputes,the SC has heeded a plea of the department of revenue. In a letter, forwarded by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBITC), the revenue secretary had requested the secretary general of the apex court to consider feasibility of setting up of a special tax bench (STB) to resolve pending litigation relating to central excise, sales tax, GST and customs duty. The department informed that in all there were more than 3,000 cases pending in the SC. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Pak violates ceasefire along LoC in Poonch | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Pakistan on Saturday violated ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in two sectors of J&K’s Poonch district, resorting to heavy mortar shelling and firing of small arms targeting forward posts in the area. “Around 5.15pm, Pakistan opened unprovoked fire and shelled mortars along the LoC in Poonch’s Shahpur and Kirni sectors, to which the Indian Army effectively retaliated,” defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said.

International community will take note of situation in Kashmir: Pakistan PM Imran Khan - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: While conceding that he has not received much traction for his shrill campaign on Kashmir, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said he is confident that ultimately the international community will take note of the situation in the Valley. In an interview to CNN, Khan, the self-designated ambassador of Kashmir, continued with his anti-India rhetoric and said there was ""no question"" of him meeting his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi after his government ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir last month. ""There's no question of me meeting Prime Minister Modi of what he's done in Kashmir,"" Khan said. But India has said that there is no question of resumption of talks with Pakistan unless it takes concrete steps to stop cross-border terrorism. On being asked why he thinks there has been no international uproar on Kashmir, Khan said the world leaders were looking at India as a market of more than a billion people. ""A lot of leaders didn't realise this. But I think even the ones who realise look upon India as a market for 1.2 (sic) billion people and trade and so on. And this is the sad thing, (valuing) material over the human,"" Khan rued. Imran Khan said he had apprised top leaders of the world about the situation in Kashmir during his trip to New York to attend the annual session of the UN General Assembly. Responding to a question, Khan said that Modi did not want any international mediation on Kashmir. ""He keeps saying it's a bilateral relation. When we try to talk to him, he says, it's a unilateral issue. So, we go around in circles,"" he said. ""But eventually, and this is my belief, this is what I think I've achieved from my trip here, I believe that the international community will move in. They will have to because this is going to become a flash point,"" he said, reiterating his warning to the international community. Responding to a question on India's assertions that Pakistan is mobilising terrorists across the Line of Control to send them to Kashmir and other parts of India to carry out terrorist activities, Khan said he has specifically told Pakistanis that anyone going into Kashmir will be an enemy of the country and an enemy of Kashmiris. ""It's the first time two nuclear-armed countries are face-to-face. If this goes like it happened in February, I mean, we immediately return the pilot when we shot down the plane because we didn't want any escalation,"" he said. ""In six years India has changed and I fear it is going to change even more rapidly. That is why I call it appeasement. The world has to take a stand,"" he said. India ended Jammu and Kashmir's special status by abrogating Article 370 of its Constitution on August 5. India's decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian ambassador. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue after India withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, but New Delhi has asserted the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". India has also said that there is no scope for any third party mediation on the Kashmir issue. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
 J&amp;K facing economic slowdown due to various kind of restrictions: Congress | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Claiming Jammu and Kashmir is passing through various kinds of restrictions leading to ""worst kind"" of economic slowdown, the Congress on Saturday urged the Centre and local administration to consider ""genuine demands"" of the business community. ""The failure of the Centre and state government to respond to the genuine demands of people to extend date for ITR and to defer implementation of harsh Motor Vehicles Act, and extension of GST date, has dismayed the people when they are very much hard pressed on economic front,"" Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) chief spokesperson Rainvder Sharma said. He said there seems no logic to reject the most genuine and justified demands in the wake of prevailing situation especially on the economic front and various kinds of restrictions making it difficult for the business community in particular and the common man in general to carry on their activities for survival. ""This kind of attitude of the centre government is quite unfortunate and disappointing for everyone,"" he said. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesMeanwhile, the state Congress also questioned the administration's decision to hold Block Development Council (BDC) elections at a time when most of the opposition political party leaders are either detained or put under house arrest. The meeting expressed serious concern over continued detention and restrictions on the political movement and all sorts of genuine political activities of Congress and mainstream pro-India political parties and groups except BJP in the state, since August 5, the party said in a statement here. ""All kinds of political activities are banned as most of Congress leaders including state president G A Mir are either detained or restrained from any sort of political activities throughout state including in Jammu region, with a view to give free field to the BJP to consolidate its position,"" the statement said. The Congress also demanded parity in the matter of security to the leaders of opposition parties in order to facilitate them to reach out to the grass root workers and the common people, for any kind of political process, to be successful, meaningful, fair and credible.

""He was speaking like he is addressing some people on the road. It was a very bad speech and only people sitting in the visitor's gallery were clapping.

The statement, published online on September 21, condemns the effect of the public lockdown on ordinary citizens. It says the situation was precipitated by the government’s decision to deoperationalise Article 370 and end Jammu & Kashmir’s statehood.

But what stood out between the two leaders was that Modi spoke for around 17 minutes, well within the allotted time-limit of between 15 to 20 minutes, for a world leader to address the global body. On the other hand, Imran Khan exceeded beyond the time limit, going on to speak for more than half-an-hour with red light constantly blinking. Modi delivered his second address to the UNGA and his first after assuming power for a second term. In 2014, Modi had spoken for nearly 35 minutes. In that address, the Prime Minister had stressed the need for a bilateral dialogue with Pakistan, but on one condition -- terror and talks cannot go together.

But, in a veiled reference to the neighbouring country, the Prime Minister said that terrorism affects all countries globally and called on the international community to unite against the menace for the sake of humanity.

US asks Pakistan to prosecute terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The US has asked Pakistan to prosecute terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar, saying the reduction of the India-Pak tensions would depend on Islamabad's seriousness in taking action against those who engage in ""cross-border infiltration"". Alice Wells, US Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia, during a special briefing during the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, when asked about President Donald Trump's offer to mediate on the Kashmir issue, said ""I think Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has made it clear his position that he's not seeking mediation."" Trump met Prime Minister Modi and Pakistan premier Imran Khan separately on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session here this week. The president is willing to mediate if asked by both parties, she said. ""I think what we would like to see are the conditions whereby India and Pakistan can have a constructive conversation that leads to an improvement of relations between the two nuclear powers,"" she said. ""And obviously, that is going to hinge off of counterterrorism, off of Pakistan's seriousness of effort in ensuring that groups don't take advantage and engage in cross-border infiltration, that there are serious steps to implement the Financial Action Task Force action plan that Pakistan has committed to, and which includes the prosecution of UN-designated terrorists,"" Wells said. ""So whether it's Hafiz Saeed who currently is in custody and under prosecution, but also leaders of Jaish-e-Mohammed, like Masood Azhar, who long have been able to exploit their presence on Pakistani soil,"" she added. Tensions between the two countries have spiked since India abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August. India's decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian ambassador. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue after India withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, but New Delhi has asserted the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". Wells said the region's stability and economic growth has long been ""unnaturally constrained"" because Central Asia is not taking advantage of the natural north-south trade into India. Pakistan is also not benefiting from living next to a 1.3 billion-person market, she said, referring to India. The benefits of improved relations between India and Pakistan are obvious, she said. She also criticised Khan for not speaking out against China, which has detained an estimated one million Uyghurs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims in Xinjiang province. China is an all-weather ally of Pakistan. Beijing has often come to the rescue of Islamabad by scuttling global efforts to impose sanctions against Pakistan-based terrorists like JeM chief Azhar. ""I would like to see the same level of concern expressed also about Muslims who are being detained in Western China, literally in concentration-like conditions. And so being concerned about the human rights of Muslims does extend more broadly than Kashmir, and you've seen the administration very involved here during the UN General Assembly and trying to shine a light on the horrific conditions that continue to exist for Muslims throughout China,"" Wells said.

PM Modi's address at the 74th session of the UNGA on Friday is likely to take place at around 7.30pm India time. He will be among the first few speakers, and Khan is slated to address the world body after him. India has made it clear that it will not mention Kashmir at all during the time allotted to speak at the global forum as revocation of the Article 370 was an entirely ""internal issue"". India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin has said that India will ""soar high if Pakistan stoops low"" by raking up the Kashmir issue at the UNGA. Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been raising the pitch aggressively on the Kashmir issue during his current US visit. Khan has been raising the spectre of a massacre in Jammu and Kashmir once the curfew is lifted during his interactions at various forums. India, on its part, has been pursuing an active diplomatic outreach, both before the UNGA and also during the ongoing session, to present its case before the world community, the reasons for revocation of special status, its plans for bringing development to Kashmir and Pakistan's role in actively stymieing any development through fostering terrorism across the border. US President Donald Trump has said that he offered ""arbitration or mediation"" on the Kashmir issue to the top leadership of India and Pakistan during separate meetings here and the two nuclear-armed neighbours have to ""just work it out"". Trump's comments came a day after he held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and two days after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan met the US President on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session. ""I said, 'Fellas, work it out. Just work it out,'"" Trump said in his opening remarks at a news conference on Wednesday after attending the UNGA session.

The college’s military science department had organised the seminar, where BJP’s national additional organisational secretary Shiv Prakash Singh was the chief guest. Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha members, however, barged into the auditorium during the seminar and created ruckus, forcing the college authorities called off the event.

Kashmiri students decline CM Yogi Adityanath’s invite to discuss merits of abrogation of Article 370 | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: Kashmiri students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have declined the invite of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for an interaction with him on September 28. The students described the invitation as “political in nature” and “unacceptable” and claimed that it is aimed to feed the state’s political propaganda. The CM had extended an invite to the students to discuss the “advantages” of the recent abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Talking to TOI on Thursday, a PhD scholar said the decision to decline the invite is a unanimous one and if anyone from the university goes to meet the CM, it will be entirely an individual’s decision and he will not represent the will of the Kashmiri students from the AMU. Another research scholar from Kashmir said that this move is politically motivated. “They want to show the world that everything is normal and all are happy with their controversial decision, which is untrue,” said the student, adding that they don’t want to become part of any misleading political activity. Students said that after a detailed discussion among them, the university administration and the government officials were told that UP CM has no sympathy towards Kashmiris, and his proposed meeting was nothing more than part of a “photo-op politics” aimed at misleading the world about the worsening humanitarian crisis and clampdown in the Valley. They also said that Kashmiri students at AMU do not want to become pawns in the hands of Yogi’s politics to create a “facade of his healthy relations with the people of Kashmir”. On Wednesday, Kashmiri students issued a statement, saying that under such circumstances, when the entire Valley is incommunicado, and alleged reports of illegal imprisonments, torture and humiliation of citizens are making international headlines, there is no use of talking to the CM. The statement reads, “If his government at the Centre has not consulted us while deciding our political fate, and has barred us from talking to our loved ones back home, by what moral right is he inviting us to talk to him.” The students asked the officials to inform UP CM that revocation of Article 370 and division of the state into Union Territories has politically disempowered Kashmiris and made them vulnerable to demographic changes. They suggested that UP CM should talk to professors, lawyers, students and common people of Kashmir who have been airlifted from Kashmir and jailed in the prisons across UP. The students affirmed that the University administration is taking care of students and they have no grievances to share with any state official. The students also said that the general grievance of Kashmiris is not within the jurisdiction of the UP CM. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Maharashtra Elections: Why Maharashtra, Haryana elections are about Article 370 vs economy | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The upcoming assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana are turning out to be a fierce battle between nullification of Article 370 and the state of Indian economy. Connecting it to nationalism, the ruling BJP has already declared that it is going to polls in the two states by making abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution as a referendum on the Narendra Modi government. Congress, on the other hand, has announced that it will highlight the “economic slowdown”. Statements of top leaders from both parties in the last few days strongly indicate that polls in Maharashtra and Haryana will be an Article 370 vs economy contest. Article 370BJP is launching the Jan Jagran Abhiyan (public awareness campaign) supporting abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A with regard to Jammu and Kashmir. As part of this programme, the party will organise 370 small indoor meetings and 35 big ones across the country, including six in Jammu and Kashmir. A few hours before the Prime Minister addressed the ‘Howdy, Modi!’ show in Houston on September 22, BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah spoke at a seminar in Mumbai on the Modi government’s “historical decision” to abrogate Article 370. Amit Shah said the Mumbai event was significant because it was the first one after the Election Commission on September 21 announced dates for assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana. Shah appealed to the people of Maharashtra to decide whether they were in favour of abrogation of Article 370 and 35A or against it. Amit Shah has also been asking former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and other senior leaders of his party to clarify whether they were in favour or against the scrapping of Article 370. On September 18, while speaking at Jamtara in Jharkhand, which is scheduled to go to polls later this year, the BJP president said, ""Our stand has been to remove Article 370 ever since it had been there,"" and asked ""why the Congress felt 'stomach ache' following its abrogation?"" Rahul Gandhi should tell people of Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana, when he goes there, whether he was with the decision to abrogate Article 370, he added. Shah also raked up the issue at Solapur in Maharashtra on September 1, when he said, ""I ask Rahul Gandhi and Sharad Pawar to make their stand clear on our decision to abrogate Article 370 and 35A of the Constitution before they go for campaigning in Maharashtra."" It was at Jind in Haryana on August 16 that Shah talked about the issue for the first time during a public rally. ""Abrogation of Article 370 and 35A is a big milestone for the unity and integrity of India. We had been saying that Kashmir was an integral part of India. But Article 370 was giving some sort of message that something is still incomplete,"" he said. ""From Jind rally, I want to tell the country that after removal of Article 370, whatever stumbling block in the development and progress of Jammu and Kashmir, Leh and Ladakh was there, has now been removed."" PM Modi has also been presenting the abrogation of Article 370 as one of the main achievements of his government. Addressing an election rally at Nashik in Maharashtra on September 19, Modi said the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir was the wish of 130 crore Indians. ""The decision has been taken to save the Kashmiris from the cycle of violence, terror and separatism. They suffered for 40 years due to Delhi's (previous Congress-led governments) wrong policies and 42,000 people were killed,"" he said. Modi attacked opposition leaders and said instead of supporting the government on the decision taken in national interest, they were making comments for their selfish political interests. ""When the country is united over the decision on Kashmir, Congress and NCP leaders have not cooperated,"" he said. Narendra Modi referred to Article 370 even at the ‘Howdy, Modi!’ show on September 22. He said, “For 70 years our country had yet another big challenge to which India has now given farewell just a few days ago… Article 370 had deprived the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh from development and equal rights. Forces of terrorism and separatism were taking advantage of the situation.” He went on to say, “The rights given by the Constitution of India to the rest of Indians are now available to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh too. Discrimination against women, children and dalits has now ended there,” inviting a huge round of applause from the 50,000-strong audience at the Houston event EconomyAs a counter to BJP’s Article 370 campaign, Congress is organising conventions from September 20 to 30 at the state level across the country to highlight the ""economic slowdown"". This will be followed by “massive agitations” across the country from October 15 to October 25 against the Modi government’s policies that have led to the “economic slowdown”. Besides, senior party leaders such as president Sonia Gandhi, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi and former finance minister P Chidambaram, who is currently lodged in Tihar Jail, have been trying to corner the Modi government over the state of the economy. On September 18, Rahul tweeted, ““Howdy” economy doin’, Mr Modi? Ain’t too good it seems.” Two days later, he again tweeted, “Amazing what PM is ready to do for a stock market bump during his #HowdyIndianEconomy jamboree. At +1.4 lakh crore rupees, the Houston event is the world's most expensive event, ever! But, no event can hide the reality of the economic mess “HowdyModi” has driven India into.” Amazing what PM is ready to do for a stock market bump during his #HowdyIndianEconomy jamboree. At + 1.4 Lakh Cro… https://t.co/XrjMghChE6— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) 1568971344000Days earlier, when Congress leaders met at the party headquarters on September 12, Rahul Gandhi said, “What India needs isn’t propaganda, manipulated news cycles and foolish theories about millennials but a concrete plan to fix the economy that we can all get behind. Acknowledging that we have a problem is a good place to start.” While chairing the same meeting of the Congress general secretaries, state presidents and the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leaders, Sonia Gandhi said, “We are meeting at a time when there is a prolonged economic slump, when job losses are mounting by the day, when the confidence of the investors is getting shakier by the day, when the government appears more and more clueless and insensitive by the day.” Manmohan Singh said the country is today in the midst of a dangerous protracted slowdown. “The dangerous thing about the present situation is that the government is complacent enough not to realise that we are in the midst of a protracted economic slowdown,” he said, adding that his successor talks about achieving a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024 but it now looks like a dream. “It is our responsibility and duty to convey this message to the country on how the BJP has misled the people and what is being done is only cosmetic to push up the atmosphere, but that the situation in the country is that what was promised is not being delivered,” he said. Singh also alleged that the government was following a policy of “tax terrorism” and warned of one million job losses if immediate steps were not taken to reverse the slump in the auto sector. Even though Chidambaram is having a brush with the law, he sought to portray that India’s decline of GDP growth rate to 5 per cent was a bigger concern than his arrest.

 Modi turned Nehru's 'injustice' into 'justice' on Article 370: BJP | India News - Times of India,"GWALIOR: The BJP on Thursday targeted first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru over Article 370, saying he did ""injustice"" to Jammu and Kashmir by according special status to the state under the controversial provision of the Constitution, but it has now been corrected by the Centre. Party spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has turned Nehru's ""injustice"" into ""justice"" by withdrawing J&K's special status under Article 370. He said Union home minister Amit Shah, who led the government's efforts to nullify Article 370, which came into force seven decades ago, has fulfilled the dreams of Sardar Vallabh Patel. ""Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, with Article 370, had done injustice to J&K. But Modiji, by abrogating it, has turned Nehru's injustice into justice."" ""And our leader Amit Shah has fulfilled the dreams of (independent India's first Home Minister) Sardar Vallabh Patel, Hussain told reporters here. ""This move (of the Modi government) has received overwhelming support from across the country, the former Union minister maintained. Hussain pointed out that some leaders of the Congress, too, supported the move to defang Article 370. ""Congress leaders like Karan Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Deepender Hooda and others have supported the move of voiding Article 370, the BJP leader said. But even after that some other Congress leaders issued statements which came handy for Pakistan to target India over the issue, he said. The senior BJP leader said based on former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi statement on Article 370, Pakistan has petitioned the United Nations. The Congress had earlier dismissed this BJP charge, saying Gandhis name was ""mischievously dragged"" by Pakistan to justify its stand on Jammu and Kashmir. Hussain alleged that Congress leader Gulam Nabi Azad, after touring Kashmir post withdrawal of its special status, has launched a ""propaganda"". However, he did not elaborate. Seeking to downplay the issue of restrictions imposed in Kashmir since August 5, when provisions of Article 370 were abrogated, Hussain said each district collector has set up communication centre under his jurisdiction. Kashmir had witnessed communication blackout for months after Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani was killed in an encounter in July 2016, he contended. ""Didnt the people face hardship then?"" he asked in reply to a query. On economic front, Hussain said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has taken several measures to boost growth and these steps have been well received by stock markets which have seen an upward trend in the last few days. ""The GDP slid in the first quarter (to 5 per cent in the April-June quarter of FY20), but growth would be alright in the next three months, he added.

" Al-Qaida, terror cells affiliated to IS plan to attack Jews, Israelis in India | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies have warned about plans of international terror outfits including al-Qaida and cells affiliated to the Islamic States (IS) of attacking Jewish and Israeli communities in India during their holiday season in September and October. The agencies have alerted the states having a significant Jewish population about the possible attacks. Three Jewish holidays fall between September and October, starting with Rosh HaShanah (Jewish New Year) which runs through September 29 and October 1, Yom Kippur (the holiest day in Judaism) falls on October 8 and 9 while Sukkot will be celebrated between October 13 and October 22. According to an official communication accessed by ANI, the agencies have received an intelligence input from the spy agencies of other countries about the terrorist outfits' plans to attack the Israeli embassy in New Delhi. The places frequented by Israelis including schools and hotels are also on the target. Sources said terror outfits are desperate to carry out attacks on Israelis living in the country after Israel supported India over the abrogation of Article 370 which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

"Chances of anarchy in wake of Article 370, CM Yogi Adityanath tells police | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked UP Police to remain cautious during the time verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid is delivered by the Supreme Court. He also asked the police to be vigilant as “some people must be looking for an excuse to spread anarchy following abrogation of Article 370.” At a law and order review meeting with eight additional director generals of police (ADGs) from across the state on Wednesday, the CM said that all police stations must immediately start holding meetings with various groups and strengthen their intelligence gathering. “Apart from staying alert during Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath, be cautious when the verdict on Ram Temple is delivered,” he told top cops. The CM said that the in his meeting with victims of triple talaq on Wednesday, he had received complaints of harassment at police stations. Similar complaints were also received during checking of vehicles, he said, and warned officials against any such act in the future. “People's attitude towards the police will change only when they get justice at police stations. Once this happens, people will perceive the police as friendly and helpful. If people cooperate with the police, crime will automatically reduce,” he said, adding that officials must take effective measures to check cow smuggling in districts bordering Nepal. ADGs have also been told to monitor the functioning of superintendents of police in their respective districts and to report any irregularity to the government. “Ensure that the only criteria for posting of SHOs is merit. Make surprise visits to one district a month and perform a thorough inspection of police stations, police lines and barracks,” the CM instructed. Yogi Adityanath has given three “mantras” to officials to boost the efficiency of the forces: encouragement, warning and holiday. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

" Pakistan conducts terrorism, follows policy of 'implausible deniability': S Jaishankar | India News - Times of India","NEW YORK: Hitting out at Pakistan, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has said India cannot talk to a ""very challenging"" neighbour that conducts terrorism as a legitimate tool of statecraft to put pressure on New Delhi to come to the negotiating table, and follows a policy of ""implausible deniability"". Addressing an event at leading think tank Council on Foreign Relations here on Wednesday, Jaishankar was asked about Kashmir and how he looks to manage New Delhi's relationship with Islamabad. ""Well you used two key words and I would like to begin by differentiating that. One was Kashmir and other was Pakistan. And I'll tell you why I do that. I don't think that the fundamental issue between India and Pakistan is Kashmir. I think it's part of the issues between us,"" he said. Jaishankar said the issue for India was not whether it talks to Pakistan, but how it can talk to a country that is conducting terrorism. ""Of course everyone wants to talk to their neighbour. The issue is, how do I talk to a country that is conducting terrorism and which frankly I would say follows a policy of implausible deniability,"" he said. ""They do it, they kind of pretend they don't do it. They know that that pretense is not serious, but yet they do it. So, how do you address that and I think it's a huge challenge for us,"" he added. Referring to the terrorist attacks in India planned and conducted from across the border, Jaishankar said Mumbai, which was attacked in November 2008, is a few thousand miles away from Kashmir. ""You had the abortive attack on the Indian Parliament. So I think...we should distinguish between the antipathy, the deep antipathy that the segments of Pakistan nurse towards India from coveting Kashmir. I think they are autonomous issues,"" he said. The external affairs minister stressed the history of India and Pakistan was not a normal history. Jaishankar said that despite being a neighbour, Pakistan will not trade with India, is a member of the WTO but will not extend MFN status, even though they are legally obliged to and New Delhi did it. ""You have a neighbour who would not allow you connectivity. So we have, for example, the potential to use Pakistan to transit on to Afghanistan, Iran but they will not allow you that connectivity,"" he said. He said such an attitude has slowed down regionalism, largely because of a concern that that might integrate them more with India's economy. ""So it's a very challenging neighbour,"" he said. ""Now, all of that you could still handle if they then don't do the one thing which is actually unacceptable in the world today, which is to conduct terrorism, as in their eyes, a legitimate tool of statecraft as a way of pressurising you to come to the negating table. ""It's not acceptable today as a sort of norm of international relations anymore. You have terrorism in different parts of the world, but there's no part of the world where the country uses it consciously, deliberately as a large scale industry against its neighbour,"" he said. Responding to a question on why the two countries have stopped playing cricket, Jaishankar said, ""it's very difficult in real life to separate issues."" Highlighting the terror attacks in Uri, Pathankot and Pulwama, he said, ""if the dominant narrative of a relationship is of terrorism, suicide bombings, violence and then you say, 'okay, guys, now tea break, let's go and play cricket'. That's a very hard narrative to sell to people."" ""So this is a democracy, the sentiments of people do matter. And the one message I don't want to give is, you do terrorism by night and it's business as usual by day. And, unfortunately, that's the message I would give if I were to follow this one (allow cricket matches between India and Pakistan,"" he said. Tensions between the two countries have spiked after India ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5. The abrogation of Article 370 evoked strong reactions from Islamabad, which downgraded ties and expelled the Indian ambassador. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue after India withdrew the special status, but New Delhi has asserted the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"".

"Aurangabad: BJP youth wing to woo young voters over coffee, focus on benefits of Article 370 | Aurangabad News - Times of India","AURANGABAD: To woo young voters in the age group of 18-25 years, the BJP has tasked its youth wing — the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) — to organise “Coffee with young voters” programme in most of the constituencies from where the party is fielding candidates. Through these interactions, BJP aims to encash on the recent abrogation of Article 370 and section 35A from Jammu and Kashmir by highlighting the importance of the decision. Instructions have been given to the organisers of these events to portray BJP as the only party that can safeguard the country, its borders and its interests. The events are set to kickstart in phases in the next two days. Sanjay Kodge, the BJYM state in-charge, said: “The state-level programme is aimed at reaching out to the maximum number of young voters who will play in a crucial role in government formation.” As per the given schedule, none of the events should be of less than 90 minutes at each of the scheduled venues. BJYM has been asked to rope-in party’s young MLAs and MPs with good oratory skills — if need be, from even different parts of the country — to address the students on Article 370 and section 35A for 30 minutes before they go ahead with an interactive question and answer session. The Q&A sessions should last for about an hour. As a part of the preparation, about 10 MPs under 40 years of age have already been lined up and their schedule in the state would soon be made public. Instructions have also been given to ensure that the events are organised at each of the revenue headquarters in the districts and the venue should be spacious enough to accommodate between 1,200-1,500 youths. BJYM state secretary Rajendra Sable Patil said the dates for the programmes in each of the districts across the state are being finalised, so that there is no overlap. The BJYM coordinators for each of the districts have been asked to make appropriate arrangements to ferry the young voters only from the assembly constituencies being contested by the BJP candidates. BJYM general secretary and Panvel deputy mayor Vikrant Patil said that during the general elections held earlier this year, more than 8.73 crore voters in the state, 1.19 crore first-time voters alone. “The young voters are playing a key role in BJP’s winning spree. As a result, we have decided to bridge the gap between our young leaders and voters.” BJP’s war rooms have been assigned the job to publicise the programme through social media networks and target youths with the content aimed at prompting them with nationalistic sentiments.

Delhi assembly elections: BJP starts campaign on Article 370 | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Setting the tone for the upcoming Delhi assembly elections, BJP national working president Jagat Prakash Nadda on Wednesday launched the Jan Jagran Abhiyan at Talkatora Stadium to explain the significance of the abolition of Article 370. With the campaign, BJP aims to reach out to people to tell them that the move was possible only because of the strong will power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “In our lifetime, we have been able to see ek vidhan, ek nishan and ek pradhan in our country. All the actions of the Modi government are aimed at protecting the unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country. It is our responsibility to tell people through this campaign about the meaning of Article 370 and 35A, when they were included, and how were they abolished,” Nadda told a gathering of BJP workers. He told the gathering that the former chief ministers of J&K Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, along with Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, have been misleading people. “In Article 370, it has been stated that this is a temporary and transitional provision,” he added. Explaining the history, Nadda claimed: “All the members of the Constitution Committee were against the inclusion of Article 370. Sheikh Abdullah batted for it, but the framer of the Constitution and first law minister Dr BR Ambedkar was against it and refused to prepare a draft. Abdullah then went to Jawaharlal Nehru and, on his direction, N Gopal Swani Ayenger prepared the draft of Article 370, which defines the inclusion of J&K into India.” Several BJP workers who attended the event were told that Nehru was to blame for the state of affairs in J&K, and they vowed to take forward the message to the residents before the elections. Nadda further stated that the Centre used to allot a large amount of funds for the development of J&K, but only three families benefited from it. “Kashmir was not part of the mainstream and only some families prospered. Article 370 was anti-Dalit, anti-women, anti-national and was necessary to be abolished,” he added. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, while claiming that the entire country was proud of the NDA government’s step, said, “BJP will intensify the campaign and reach out to all the sections of society in the capital.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Pre-August 5 Kashmir was a mess: Jaishankar on Article 370 | India News - Times of India,"NEW YORK: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday outlined that before abrogation of Article 370 Jammu and Kashmir was in a mess while adding that the restrictions were imposed in the region to prevent loss of lives following the stripping of special status. He said that the Indian government's first concern was to ensure that there was no loss of lives due to violence and demonstrations in the region post abrogation of Article 370. ""We had the experience of 2016 when a self-advertised terrorist cult figure called Burhan Wani was killed and after that, there was a spike in violence. Our intention was to manage the situation (post Article 370) without loss of life and restrictions were intended to do that,"" he said. ""As many as 42,000 people were killed in the last 30 years. Level of intimidation had reached a height where senior police officers were lynched on streets of Srinagar. Journalists who wrote against separatism were assassinated, military personnel returning home for Eid were kidnapped and killed. So, Pre August 5 Kashmir was in a mess. Difficulties in Kashmir did not start on August 5. It is supposed to be a way of dealing with those difficulties,"" the minister underlined. Jaishankar said that the situation in the region has now stabilised and lots of restrictions have been rolled back including the operationalising of landlines and mobile towers and resumption of economic activity. ""Particular efforts are being made to keep the supplies normal in the state. This is a harvest season for apples. Efforts are being made to procure apples so that farmers do not get victimised by these changes,"" he said. He explained how Jammu and Kashmir acceded to India after the country gained freedom in 1947 and the drafting of Article 370. ""The situation in Jammu and Kashmir was peculiar for a number of reasons as it was a border state but also they were themselves under attack at that time. They had the desire to extend the period of alignment with the rest of India in terms of the application of laws. The Constituent Assembly recognised that it was a special case at that time,"" he said in an interactive session with Frank G. Wisner, a former US ambassador to India. ""The only temporary article of the constitution was drafted which was called Article 370. At that time, it was numbered as 306a. After the Constitution was adopted, there was a series of presidential proclamations under that article which started aligning the state. In the last 70 years, you had 54 of these presidential proclamations,"" Jaishankar added. Outlining the reasons of the problems faced in Jammu and Kashmir after Article 370 was adopted, the minister said that the presidential proclamations were very rapid in the initial years and there was a climate of intimidation and separatism in Kashmir. ""You did not have the economic activity in Jammu and Kashmir as compared to the rest of India. There were less job opportunities and there was a more sense of alienation, separatism and therefore, a climate of terrorism across the border. The state was in socio-economic terms less aligned with India. 100 important progressive laws of India did not apply to Kashmir,"" Jaishankar remarked. The minister said that the temporary provision allowed a set of narrow elite to arbitrage Article 370 for monopolising political power and creating a close loop politics. ""They had vested interests in keeping alive separatist sentiments. You had a situation where separatist political parties were openly allied with terror groups operating out of Pakistan. They had vested interests in keeping alive separatist sentiments,"" he said. India has repeatedly maintained that constitutional changes made by its government on Kashmir are strictly an internal matter, a stance supported by several countries, including those from SAARC and Arab World. Pakistan, on the other hand, has ""condemned"" the move and downgraded its bilateral ties with India. Islamabad has since resorted to anti-India rhetoric and has attempted to internationalise the Kashmir issue, but to no avail. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Secularism is not under threat in India, says Jaishankar | India News - Times of India","NEW YORK: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesdaysaid that secularism is not under threat in India and that it is promoted by the ethos of the society. ""I don't accept that secularism is under threat in India,"" the External affairs minister said during a conference at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) here. ""At the end of the day,"" he added, ""secularism was not promoted by the law or by a constitutional belief. Instead, it was promoted by the ethos of the society."" ""So if the ethos of the society was not secular then no constitutional provision would have ensured it. And I don't think that the ethos of the society has ever changed. I think the ethos of the country, especially the Hindu ethos has remained much secular and pluralistic,"" Jaishankar added. The changes that India has been witnessing since its independence nearly 70 years ago are the direct results of the democratisation of the country, the minister said in response to a question regarding the erosion of constitutional commitment to a secular state and the rise of a politicised Hindu nationalism in India. The changes that have taken place in India actually demonstrate the successes of the democracy in the country and what it has meant in terms of the consequences on the ground, Jaishankar said.

An invitation has also been sent to Kashmiri students in Aligarh Muslim University, where many have been sitting on protest since the Centre announced the abrogation on August 5. However, they are learnt to have refused the invite.

UP CM Yogi Adityanath invites AMU's Kashmiri students to discuss abrogation of Article 370 | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has invited Kashmiri students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and a few from Noida and Ghaziabad for an interactive session at his residence in Lucknow on Saturday. However, the students are yet to respond positively to the chief minister's invite and sought more time to mull over. The CM is likely to discuss the issues faced by students following the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A which gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. According to a letter addressed to district magistrates of Aligarh, Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar, 40 Kashmiri students from each district are to be invited for an interaction with the CM. The letter has been sent to the registrar of the AMU Abdul Hamid and he will provide 40 names to the district authorities. The varsity’s registrar told TOI that he has communicated to the students about the invite, but so far there has been no positive response. He said, “the students are reluctant to meet the CM as they don’t want to discuss anything related to Article 370, but we told them that this is just an interaction and they can discuss the problems being faced by them or any kind of inconvenience related to law and order situation in the valley”. In the evening, a group of students met district magistrate CB Singh, but they have not confirmed their participation and sought some more time to think over it. However, a Kashmiri student, Sajjad Subham Rathar, who is the former vice president of AMU Students’ Union told TOI that they were likely to meet the CM, but the plan has not yet been finalised. He said that they would inform the administration on Thursday after discussion with other Kashmiri students. The students have planned to meet around 10.30pm and discuss it in detail. Notably, last month over 250 Kashmiri students of the university had boycotted the lunch invite from Government of India (GOI) on the day of Eid at the varsity’s guest house. In a statement issued on the eve of Eid, the Kashmiri student said that they are dismayed by the invite, which has political connotation and is aimed to rub salts on their wounds. “We take this invitation as an opportunity to reject the Delhi’s authoritarianism and drama played in the parliament on August 5,” reads the statement given by J&K students.

Azad was talking to the media as he concluded his six-day tour of the state. ""There is disappointment in Kashmir and the despair is also prevalent among the people in Jammu province. Except 100 or 200 people of the ruling party (BJP), nobody is happy (over the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories),"" the former chief minister told reporters before leaving for Delhi. Azad, who had on Tuesday arrived in Jammu on the second-leg of his tour, had said the situation in Kashmir is ""very bad"". The Congress leader had reached Srinagar on Friday on his maiden visit to the Valley after the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5. His three earlier bids to reach Srinagar had failed as he had been turned back from the airport by the authorities. ""I have not seen such a terror of the administration anywhere in the world. Democracy is nowhere in the state after the change in its status. It has vanished from the state,"" Azad said. He claimed that the people are afraid of talking, feeling that someone was going to tip-off the government about it. ""With the change in the status, the voices have also been suppressed and there is no place for freedom of speech, freedom of expression or freedom of agitation,"" he said. ""Even if somebody is talking about normal protests over the demands for electricity and water, he is asked which jail he wants to go in India,"" the Congress leader alleged. Soon after his arrival here from Kashmir where he spent four days, Azad had said, ""I have not even been allowed by the administration to visit 10 per cent of the places where I had planned to go in the valley during my stay there."" Azad's visit became possible after the Supreme Court on September 16 allowed him to tour the state. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, had allowed the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha to visit four districts -- Srinagar, Jammu, Baramulla, Anantnag -- to meet people. The bench had been told by Azad's counsel and senior advocate A M Singhvi that the Congress leader wants to meet people and inquire about their welfare. In his petition filed in his ""personal capacity"", Azad had told the Supreme Court that he had tried to visit the state thrice, but was turned back from the airport. A number of delegations representing various sections of the society including traders, transporters and border residents met Azad at his residence here. Azad also visited traders of Raghunath Bazar, Purani Mandi, Residency Road and other areas of the city to know about their difficulties in the prevailing situation in the state, a congress spokesman said.

""When it happened, Pakistan raised a hue and cry over it but the entire world stood with (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji. Within a day, we got support from 10 countries and 100 diplomats also said it is India's internal matter,"" he said. Nadda said even at the UN Security Council meeting, there was no discussion over the issue. ""We should consider ourselves lucky that we witnessed this historic step. The abrogation of special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir is a historic step. India has become so powerful at the world stage under our leadership. ""Now it is our responsibility to bring Kashmir into the mainstream, ensure its progress and ward off the evil eye that was cast on it,"" he said. Urging BJP workers to educate people about the advantages of the step, he said, ""We should know what is articles 370 and 35A, what were the disadvantages and how they are no longer in place for Jammu and Kashmir. People should be educated about the advantages of this move. ""The BJP has to see its best as yet. We have a strong leadership and a strong leader, and we have to take this message forward,"" he said while addressing workers. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari used the occasion to target the Delhi government and over it delaying giving prosecution sanction in the JNU sedition case. ""In Delhi we see an atmosphere where people in power support the slogan ' Bharat tere tukde honge'. They do not allow the case to proceed against those who raise such slogans,"" he said.

 No problem talking to Pakistan but can't talk to 'Terroristan': S Jaishankar | India News - Times of India,"NEW YORK: India has no problem talking to Pakistan but it has a problem talking to “Terroristan”, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said here, asserting that Islamabad has created an entire industry of terrorism to deal with the Kashmir issue. Jaishankar, addressing a New York audience at cultural organization Asia Society Tuesday, said when India decided to revoke Article 370 and bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, it   drew a reaction   from Pakistan and China. Pakistan downgraded diplomatic relations with India and also   expelled Indian high commissioner   after New Delhi revoked the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir on Aug 5. China had voiced ""serious concern"" over the situation in Kashmir, saying ""the parties concerned should exercise restraint and act with caution, especially to avoid actions that unilaterally change the status quo and exacerbate tension."" Jaishankar emphasized that India has no problem talking to Pakistan. “But we have a problem talking to Terroristan. And they have to be one and not be the other,” he said. Jaishankar underlined that revoking Article 370 has no implications for India's external boundaries. “We are sort of reformatting this within our existing boundaries. It obviously drew a reaction from Pakistan, it drew a reaction from China. These are two very different reactions. I think, for Pakistan, it was a country which has really created an entire industry of terrorism to deal with the Kashmir issue. In my view, it's actually bigger than Kashmir, I think they have created it for India,” Jaishankar said. He added that in the aftermath of India's decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir's special status, Pakistan now sees its “investment” of 70 years undercut if this policy succeeds. “So theirs is today a reaction of anger, of frustration in many ways, because you have built an entire industry over a long period of time,” he said. When asked that Pakistan has said a lot and what does he think it would do, Jaishankar said this is not a Kashmir issue but a bigger issue than that and Pakistan has to accept that the “model which they have built for themselves, no longer works. That you cannot, in this day and age, conduct policy using terrorism as a legitimate instrument of statecraft. I think that's at the heart of the issue.” Jaishankar recalled that over the years in Jammu and Kashmir, the lack of development, lack of opportunity, “actually created a sense of alienation, alienation to separatism, separatism used for terrorism.” When asked what does Pakistan need to do as a precondition for Kashmir talks, Jaishankar said, “I think we are getting this wrong. First of all Pakistan has to do something for its own good and if it does that, it would enable a normal neighbourly relationship with India.” He added that it is not like India and Pakistan agree on everything else and the two countries have wonderful relationships and there is a Kashmir issue. “We had an attack on Mumbai city. The last time I checked, Mumbai city was not a part of Kashmir. So if Pakistani terrorists can attack states and regions which are far removed from Kashmir, we have got to recognize that there is a bigger problem out there,” the minister said. The problem is really the “mindset,” he said adding that every time there is a change of government in Pakistan, ""somebody says its new and nothing to do with the earlier guys"" and blames the previous government. Second, they say, ""it has nothing to do with us as a country, it's all the Americans. The Americans taught us the bad habits by doing the Afghan jihad. We were good people till you came along,” he said, taking a strong jibe at Pakistan. “There is a fundamental issue there which they need to understand and we need to encourage them to do - that is to move away from terrorism,” he said, adding that at one level it's a huge issue and another level it's a very obvious issue. “These are not activities which are subterranean. These are activities in broad day light. They know where the camps are, anybody knows where the camps are, just google them. You'll find them,” he said. Jaishankar emphasized that the provision in the Indian Constitution which gave Kashmir a different status was a temporary provision. “Now, here's the funny thing. We rarely read that in the international press.” “We agree on what the word temporary means, it means something comes to an end. After 70 years, it came to an end. And 70 years is a decent definition of the word temporary,” he said. He said when the Narendra Modi government was voted back into power, it took a long hard look at what its options are about Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. “And the options were either we do more of the same knowing it doesn't work, or we do something different. So I think the choice was ok, we will do something different. And that something different, by the way, has no implications for the external boundaries of India,” he said. On China, he said Beijing misread what was happening in Jammu and Kashmir after the revocation of Article 370. “Now, I don't know why they believe that it impacted on them,” he said, adding that he went to Beijing a few days after the Constitutional change and explained to them that “as far as they were concerned, nothing had changed. India's boundaries had not changed, the line of actual control has not changed. So that was the conversation we had with them.” In Video:No problem talking to Pakistan but 'Terroristan': External Affairs Minister S JaishankarDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Ajit Doval arrives in Kashmir Valley on second visit since abrogation of J&amp;K's special status | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: National Security Advisor Ajit Doval arrived here on Wednesday to take stock of the situation in Kashmir Valley and decide the future course of action for the smooth implementation of government plans after the withdrawal of special status of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said. Doval will meet top security officials and take stock of security and development-related activities in the state, which will be converted into two union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh -- on October 31, the officials said. It was not immediately known how long the NSA would stay in the valley. The NSA had camped for 11 days in the valley after the Centre announced its decision to withdraw the special status of the state under Article 370 and split it into two Union territories on August 5. During that period, he had ensured that there was no violence in the aftermath of the government's decision. During his previous stay, he had taken rounds of the militancy-hit Shopian town in south Kashmir and Downtown Srinagar. He had also addressed personnel of the Jammu and Kashmir Police, CRPF and Army separately, telling them about their successes in disturbed areas and underling their importance in ensuring the safety of the country and citizens. The NSA has been closely monitoring the situation and ensuring smooth coordination between all arms of security forces in the hinterland as well as along the line of control. On August 5, the government announced the decision to abrogate special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution, and dividing the state into two Union territories.

" Kapil Sibal cites UK Supreme Court's verdict, says no scrutiny of bills in India | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Wednesday cited the UK Supreme Court's verdict to claim that in India there is no scrutiny of bills and it is a wake up call for the courts. Attacking the Modi government, Sibal said it is adopting different ways to silence the opposition that includes the income tax scrutiny against Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa's family, against whom notices have been sent, and Enforcement Directorate (ED) action against NCP leader Sharad Pawar. The senior Congress leader said in India there is no scrutiny as bills are passed as 'money bills' and some key acts like the abrogation of Article 370 and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) have been passed without proper scrutiny. Citing the UK Supreme Court's verdict, Sibal said executive power cannot silence legislative scrutiny. In a body blow for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the UK Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that his controversial move to suspend Parliament in the run-up to Brexit was ""unlawful"". ""UK Supreme Court : Executive power can't silence Legislative scrutiny. In India no scrutiny of : 1) Clearly not 'Money Bills'. 2) UAPA; Amending Article 370 etc. Other ways to silence opposition: Latest: Lavasa's family; Sharad Pawar. A wake up call for Courts!,"" he tweeted. Earlier, another Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had said that the significance of UK Supreme Court's judgement for those of us who live in other parliamentary systems inspired by the British model should not be missed. ""The judgement makes clear that the leeway for the political executive to subvert convention is limited: the executive cannot simply distort the rules of procedure&conduct of business under the garb of the Parliament's privilege as a sovereign body to do as it wants. The Court's reasoning is that the executive's legislative majority cannot be used to obstruct Parliament's work,"" he tweeted ""To put it bluntly, the executive, in the name of its Parliamentary majority, cannot use Parliament's own powers and privileges to undermine itself. In short, Parliament cannot be induced by its own majority to commit suicide. Note: UK precedents are often cited by Indian courts,"" he also said.

Donald Trump 'encourages' PM Modi to improve relations with Pakistan: White House - Times of India,"UNITED NATIONS: US President Donald Trump ""encouraged"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi to improve relations with Pakistan and fulfil his promise to better the lives of the Kashmiri people, according to a readout issued by the Prime Minister Modi and President Trump met on Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session here - their fourth meeting since Modi came to power for a second term in May this year. Their 40-minute talks mainly focused on the bilateral trade and issues related to terrorism emanating from Pakistan. President Trump noted good progress on defence and security cooperation, the readout said. ""Additionally, the President encouraged Prime Minister Modi to improve relations with Pakistan and fulfil his promise to better the lives of the Kashmiri people,"" it added. India maintains that the Kashmir issue is a bilateral one and no third party has any role in it. Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after India abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. India's action evoked strong reactions from Pakistan which downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian Ambassador. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said the Prime Minister explained in detail to President Trump the challenges faced by India due to terrorism, especially in Jammu and Kashmir. He told President Trump that 42,000 lives have been lost in the last 30 years due to terrorism in Kashmir and sought the support from the international community to fight the scourge of terrorism, Gokhale told reporters at a briefing. ""We expect that the overtures the Prime Minister has made over the years ought to have been reciprocated and none of them have been reciprocated, beginning with Prime Minister's invitation of the oath taking ceremony and then as Prime Minister said his unique trip to Lahore in December 2015 with minimum security,"" Gokhale said. He added that Prime Minister Modi explained to President Trump that immediately after his visit to Lahore in 2015, there was an attack on the Pathankot Airbase and Pakistan has not brought the perpetrators of the crime to justice. ""The Prime Minister has made it clear that we are not shying away from talks with Pakistan. But for that to happen, we expect some concrete steps to be taken by Pakistan. And we do not find any effort by Pakistan taking those steps,"" Gokhale said. Prime Minister Modi put forward India's perspective on the issue of terrorism and President Trump showed understanding,"" the foreign secretary said, adding that the US leader also recognised and accepted that this is a challenge that both the countries face. The Prime Minister also noted that among the significant number of foreign fighters (in terror groups like Islamic State and Al-Qaeda) the level of participation from India is very low. He also told President Trump that though India was home to world's second largest Muslim population, there was lower level of radicalisation among them, Gokhale said. Prime Minister Modi put forward India's perspective on the issue of terrorism as President Trump vowed to protect innocent civilians from the threat of ""radical Islamic terrorism"" during the 'Howdy, Modi' event in Houston on Sunday. Both leaders also expressed concerns about the situation in Afghanistan and shared ideas about how to work together to promote security and prosperity in the country, it said. The two leaders discussed progress on different aspects of their strategic partnership and upcoming opportunities to ensure it remains strong, it added.

"Qureshi writes to UN Secretary General, UNSC President outlining Pakistan's legal case on Kashmir - Times of India","ISLAMABAD: Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has written to the UN Secretary General and President of the UN Security Council highlighting Pakistan's legal case on the Jammu and Kashmir issue. The foreign office said in a statement on Wednesday that the letter, alongwith a detailed factsheet and comprehensive annexures highlighted the ""illegal, unilateral, coercive"" Indian actions of August 5. The Indian government revoked the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into two union territories.

Qureshi, in his letter to UN chief Antonio Guterres and UNSC President Vasily Nebenzya, said Indian action aimed at bringing about a ""demographic change"" in Kashmir. He said India wanted to ""preempt the UN-administered plebiscite"" envisaged under numerous UN Security Council Resolutions to ascertain the wishes of the Kashmiri people to join Pakistan or India.

Narendra Modi:   'No pressure on Modi': Imran Khan disappointed with world community over Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"NEW YORK: Admitting that Pakistan has failed in its attempts to internationalise the Kashmir issue, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday said he was disappointed with the international community over the issue. Pakistan has been repeatedly   snubbed by the international community   on several platforms after it cried foul over India's abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,   with many countries backing New Delhi   on the matter. ""(I am) disappointed by the international community. If eight million Europeans or Jews or even eight Americans were put under siege, would the reaction have been the same? There's no pressure yet on Modi to lift the siege. We'll keep putting the pressure...What are 9,00,000 troops doing there? Once the curfew is lifted, god knows what is going to happen after that...You think Kashmiris will quietly accept that Kashmir has been annexed?"" he stated at a presser in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Imran Khan says he will forcefully present Kashmir issue at UNGAPakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Pakistan's envoy to the UN Maleeha Lodhi were also present at the press conference with Khan. Khan acknowledged India's economic stature and global prominence while responding to why Pakistan's narrative on Kashmir is being overlooked. ""The reason is India, people look upon India as a market of 1.2 billion people...Some are appalled by it but by the end of it, they think of it as a market,"" he said. PM Modi will take care of it: Trump on cross-border terrorUS President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that it will be great if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan can ""work out something"" on Kashmir, distancing himself from any mediation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Trump made the remarks as he met Prime Minister Modi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session -- their fourth meeting since Modi came to power for a second term in May this year.

 India counters Pakistan's bid to raise Kashmir at Eurasian Speakers' meet | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh on Tuesday strongly countered Pakistan's attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at an international Speakers' meet and said the neighbouring country is a ""known exporter of terrorists and epicentre of terrorism"". Addressing the Eurasian Speakers' meet in Kazakhstan, Harivansh said Pakistan was trying to hijack the meeting agenda by raising the issue and charged it with illegally occupying a part of Jammu and Kashmir and ""finishing the identity and self-respect of locals"". Terming Pakistan's remarks as ""very irresponsible"", he said, ""We feel that they have tried to hijack this meeting and raise issues which are not only totally unrelated to the subject matter of this forum but are absolutely internal matter of ours"". ""Ironically, Pakistan has no authority - moral or otherwise, to dwell on Jammu and Kashmir which is an integral part of India. I did not want to say this but since my Pakistani counterpart has been insistent, I will have to make this point, the entire world knows that it is Pakistan that has illegally occupied our part of Jammu & Kashmir and they have finished the identity and self-respect of local people there,"" he said at the conference. Harivansh in his speech forcefully countered the statements made by the Pakistani counterpart about Kashmir and said terrorism is an international concern and biggest threat to humanity. The Rajya Sabha deputy chairman said state sponsored terrorism and cross-border terrorism have today become a threat not only to India but to the entire humanity. ""What is most ironic is that this issue is being raised by a country which is a known exporter of terrorists and is the epicenter of terrorism for entire world,"" he said at the 4th Meeting of Speakers of the Eurasian Countries' Parliaments at Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. Pakistan has been raising the Kashmir issue at international forums including at the South Asian Speakers' Summit in the Maldives and a UNICEF event in Sri Lanka recently. India has strongly scuttled such bids. Harivansh said the theme of this meeting - 'Greater Eurasia: Dialogue, Trust, Partnership' is very topical and appropriate, given the critical importance of Eurasia in the emerging global economy and geopolitics. ""Our role and contributions as Presiding Officers and the Parliamentarians will be of great significance in this endeavour,"" he said. He said, ""India attaches a great deal of importance to our relations with the countries of Eurasian region. We have a long historical, cultural, economic, trade and civilizational linkages with the countries of this region. We have always endeavoured to promote and develop this cooperation and engagement. India is keen to put in place a Trade Arrangement with the Eurasian Economic Union."" He said India is actively engaged bilaterally and multilaterally to promote connectivity in this region through various mechanisms such as International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC), Ashgabat Agreement, United Nations ‘Transports Internationaux Routiers' (TIR) Convention, etc. ""Let me share India's vision for a more secure and prosperous Eurasian space as well as its concerns. Globalization is under stress due to new and emerging geo-political and geo-economic faultlines. India supports a rule-based order in the region, as in the rest of the world. ""But we confront unavoidable challenges such as terrorism, conflicts, trans-national crimes and maritime threats. There are also issues of climate change, sustainable development, energy security, gender equality and connectivity. These must be urgently addressed for our common good,"" he said. Noting that sustainable development remains at the centre of all our initiatives and programmes, the Rajya Sabha deputy speaker said climate change poses significant development challenges, especially for developing countries need resources and technical assistance to achieve sustainable development. India, he said, has long tradition of preserving Mother Earth for future generations. ""Sustainable development remains at the centre of all our initiatives and programmes,"" Harivansh said. ""Our development actions are guided by the philosophy 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas' which means inclusive growth. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji's nationwide multi-sectoral initiative 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao- Save the Girl Child, Educate Her' has been conceived to tackle the issue of child sex ratio and education of girls.

 China concerned over India-US closer ties: Subramanian Swamy | India News - Times of India,"BEIJING: India's concern on terrorism emanating from Pakistan and China's apprehensions on the close ties between the US and India could figure in the talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their upcoming informal summit, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has said. Swamy, a Rajya Sabha MP, was in Beijing on a five-day visit on the invitation of the Tsinghua University, where he addressed a meeting on the progress made by China in the last 70 years. He also took part in the interactive meetings with Chinese officials and think-tanks. He also met with Indian ambassador to China, Vikram Misri. On Monday, he met Chinese Vice foreign minister and former ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui and discussed Sino-India relations. Interacting with the Indian media on Monday, Swamy said while Chinese officials expressed concern over the emerging close ties between India and the US, he raised issues relating to Beijing's backing to Islamabad over issues concerning terrorism. Swamy said he believes that both China's concerns over India-US ties and India's concerns on issues related to Pakistan specially terrorism could come up in the Modi-Xi informal summit next month. This would be the second informal summit between the two leaders. The first one was held at the Chinese city of Wuhan. He said the Chinese officials said they are looking forward to the 2nd informal summit. Both sides have not officially announced it yet. ""There is a certain concern in China which we need to remove as to where India-US relations are moving in the context of what is happening between the US and China,"" he said. China is locked in a bruising trade war with the US since last year. The two top economies of the world were locked in a strategic rivalry as China is fast expanding its global influence. Swamy, who has been visiting China and interacting with the ruling Communist Party officials for over three decades, said India should do take some confidence building measures to allay Beijing's concern on India-US ties. ""India, China relations are primary important. America is far away. And America has its own cost benefit analysis. Latest is Afghanistan. Had US troops planned to leave on September 1 handing it over to Taliban it would have been a security disaster for India,"" he said. ""I think we must therefore ensure that our relations with China are healthy,"" he said. China's concerns included India's participation in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue involving the US, Japan and Australia as well as the Indo-Pacific concept and Beijing's apprehension over its impact in the disputed South China Sea, Swamy said. Swamy said he has expressed ""deep concern at the fact that China being supportive of Pakistan even while they are sending terrorists to India"". ""I also explained that the revocation of Article 370 is no business of Pakistan. It is part of the Indian Constitution. Indian Constitution also prescribes how it can be removed,"" he said, referring to the removal of special status to Jammu and Kashmir. China had objected to the formation of Ladakh as Union territory, saying that it undermined its territorial sovereignty, evoking a sharp reaction from India, which told Beijing to refrain from commenting on its ""internal affairs"". Swamy said he told the Chinese officials that the UNSC resolution on Kashmir has become a ""dead letter"". About criticism related to China's backing to Pakistan, the Chinese officials explained that ""the things they have done are the minimum to keep Pakistan feeling that"" it has not been abandoned. ""We don't want to appear we have abandoned Pakistan,"" Swamy quoted a Chinese official as saying. Also, China is concerned that India may ""do something"" in Ladakh sector after the removal of the article 370, he said. The India-China border dispute covers 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control. Both countries so far held 21 rounds of Special Representatives talks to resolve the boundary dispute. Swamy said he has suggested to China to establish an India, China and Pakistan track-2 dialogue to discuss issues related to terrorism. ""I suggested that there could be off the record meeting of the Indians, Chinese and Pakistanis because there was an admission that China is also suffering from Islamic terrorism. So we then have common interest there. It could be non-official, like track-2. They were enthusiastic about it,"" he said. The track two dialogue should be confined only to issues related to terrorism and not to any other issues, he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 How India's rising global profile is helping government's move on Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"If Prime Minister Narendra Modi was worried about a frosty reception in the US after the government's decision to   abrogate Article 370   , which granted special status to Kashmir, President Donald Trump was quick to put those fears to rest. “Border security is vital to India,” Trump said alongside PM Modi, as the two spoke at a huge gathering of around 50,000 Indian-Americans on Sunday. “We understand that.” The high-level acknowledgment from the world’s most powerful political leader comes as Modi government — who will address the United Nations General Assembly on Friday — continues the security clampdown in Jammu and Kashmir. Trump’s comments, although not explicit approval, are symbolic of the quiet acceptance of India’s policies which have attracted little international criticism. Just a few countries, other than Pakistan and China, which both have territorial claims in disputed Kashmir, have criticized New Delhi — a stark contrast to the 22 states that signed a letter criticizing China’s crackdown against Muslim minority Uighurs in Xinjiang, which has seen as many as 1 million citizens placed in “re-education camps.” Nations want to keep PM Modi onside as they recognize India’s rising strategic importance in Asia as a counterweight to Beijing. There’s also the size of its market, including billions in arms purchases, and the fact that criticizing New Delhi risks aligning with Pakistan, which is widely accused of sponsoring terrorist groups in the region. “There is little diplomatic upside to directly challenging India,” said Paul Staniland, an associate professor at the University of Chicago. “India is an important economic and strategic partner, or potential partner, for countries ranging from France to the US to the Gulf states. It’s also clear that the government of India won’t be rolling back its policy anytime soon, and many countries are leery of seeming to back the Pakistani line.” ‘Grave concern’Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, whose government denies supporting terrorists that strike inside India, told Trump on Monday there’s “a huge humanitarian crisis taking place” in the region. He added the US has a responsibility to get involved. “This crisis is going to get much bigger, what is happening in Kashmir,” Khan said. “The United States — it’s the most powerful country, it can affect the United Nations Security Council, it has a voice, so we look to the US to put out flames in the world.” The BJP had long campaigned on removing Kashmir’s special status, and moved swiftly to enact its plans following a sweeping election victory in May. But despite the prolonged detention of political leaders and the deployment of 10,000 extra paramilitary forces, Kashmir’s turmoil has generated only muted global responses. A group of United Nations experts urged India to revoke its communications blackout, while Human Rights Watch has condemned the arbitrary detention of thousands. A separate group of United Nations experts has expressed “grave concern” over a citizenship drive in Assam, where 1.9 million people — a substantial number of whom are Muslims — are at risk of being stripped of their national identity. Home Minister Amit Shah has previously called illegal migrants “termites,” and the UN experts warned the registration process “may exacerbate the xenophobic climate while fueling religious intolerance and discrimination in the country.” One reason Modi’s Kashmir move has not provoked more global outcry, said Kashish Parpiani, a fellow with New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, is the image India has successfully presented to the rest of the world. “India’s status as a rising free-market, rancorous democracy known for soft power exports like yoga and Bollywood lend it a benign character,” Parpiani said. “Whereas China often acquires the ire of the international community owing to the common narrative surrounding its efforts to build an Orwellian authoritarian system.” Important allyPM Modi wasn’t always beyond reproach. In 2005, he was denied a US visa after the 2002 Gujarat riots when he was the chief minister, although he was officially cleared of blame. Some now want to prevent the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation from giving PM Modi an award over abuses in Kashmir and Assam. PM Modi has avoided the same type of international criticism China has received because what’s happening in Kashmir is nowhere near as bad as China’s abuses in Xinjiang, said Sameer Patil, a former assistant director at India’s National Security Council Secretariat and now International Security Studies Programme fellow at the Mumbai-based Gateway House. “The other thing that’s important to understand is the strength of India’s market,” Patil said. Just as China has utilized its market size as leverage, India has also started to think this is something which ought to be used for foreign policy objectives.” India has also skillfully handled the Trump administration, agreeing to significantly reduce Iranian oil imports, for example, while reacting forcefully after Trump offered to mediate the Kashmir dispute. “The Modi government has managed Trump and his administration quite well, knowing when to flatter and when to push back,” said, Ian Hall, an international relations professor at Australia’s Griffith University. “Washington understands that India matters, because India complicates Beijing’s calculations, not just in South Asia, but across the Indo-Pacific.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Anachronistic Article 370 encouraged terrorism: S Jaishankar | India News - Times of India,"LONDON: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has described as ""constitutionally proper"" the revocation of Article 370 to withdraw the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and said the previous provision was ""exploited"" by Pakistan to conduct cross-border terrorism. Writing in the UK's 'Financial Times' newspaper on Tuesday, the minister sought to counter criticism over Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government's announcement over the ""anachronistic provision"" last month, which he said had resulted in socio-economic injustice due to the inability to apply national laws in Jammu and Kashmir. ""The earlier provision created a cosy arrangement of local ownerships that served the state's political elite well. But it denied economic opportunities and social gains for the masses. The resulting separatist sentiments in some quarters were then exploited by neighbouring Pakistan to conduct cross-border terrorism,"" he wrote. ""Parliament's changes to Jammu and Kashmir's status are constitutionally proper and received support beyond the ruling Bharatiya Janata party and its allies as it was passed by a two-thirds majority. It reflects a larger consensus on the need for drastic reform,"" he noted. The article went on the lay out the context of the Modi government's move and claims that although the central government spent 10 times more on the average resident of Jammu and Kashmir than in the rest of the country, that investment did not show up on the ground. Infrastructure projects slowed down amid concerns about irregularities in public finance. Recent reports of corruption in banking and recruitment underlined this situation, with residents having to seek education, medical access and employment in other provinces. ""The inability to apply national laws has led to the denial of socio-economic justice. State laws did not give women equal rights on property and prevented child protection programmes. They rejected affirmative action that was practised in the rest of India,"" Jaishankar said. ""Domestic violence laws, female representation in local bodies and the right to education were all kept at bay. Discrimination against refugees was open,"" he added. ""A provision intended to provide temporary comfort to the process of aligning with the rest of the nation was misused for many years. By doing so, it encouraged links between separatist politicians and terrorist groups sponsored by Pakistan. As minorities were driven out of the state in their thousands, this polarised environment was exploited politically."" The external affairs minister highlighted the loss of thousands of lives due to terrorist attacks over the past decades in the region and said the move by the government was a difficult choice between continuing with the old policy or pursuing ""progress and modernity by changing the region's legal status"". The government has chosen the bolder and better option which should be applauded, not criticised,"" he said. The legislative changes have not altered India's external boundaries or the 'Line of Control' that delineates the territory under the control of India and Pakistan. The changes are entirely domestic, he added. ""As they make a positive impact on the lives of the people, the justification for cross-border terrorism will become even more untenable. The boundaries of Indian states have been reorganised 14 times since independence. What has now happened in respect to Jammu and Kashmir is the norm, not an aberration,"" he added. He detailed PM Modi's efforts at addressing the wider social, economic and political challenges in order to advance India, including gender discrimination, climate change and river pollution and the spread digital access, improve skills, boost start-ups, manufacturing, generate jobs and embrace technology. ""His policy towards Jammu and Kashmir is fully in consonance with his vision of a new and modern India. India is a democratic society with robust parliamentary practices. This is a well-intended change designed to improve daily lives and create more opportunities,"" he wrote. ""There is a new reality in the making in Jammu and Kashmir. It is driven by economic development, social progress and gender justice. Its future is based on freedom from intimidation and fear of terrorists. Those who identify with these goals will surely welcome the change,"" he added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Kashmiris' fear about losing land, jobs after special status abrogation should be allayed: Mohan Bhagwat | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday said the fear of losing land and jobs among people of Jammu and Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370 provisions should be allayed and asserted that putting an end to the region's special status will help integrate Kashmiris with rest of the country. Govt revokes Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, bifurcates state into two Union TerritoriesAccording to sources, while interacting with journalists representing foreign media, he claimed that Kashmiris were earlier ""alienated"" but the repeal of the provisions of Article 370 will remove the barriers that existed between them and the rest of the nation. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), in a statement, said, ""This interaction was part of the continuous process where the 'Sarsanghchalak' (chief) engages in constructive dialogue with people from different walks of the society."" About apprehensions of Kashmiris that the move on Article 370 will lead to ""outsiders"" buying their land, Bhagwat is learnt to have said, ""Whatever fears they have about losing land and jobs should be allayed."" On the issue of National Register of Citizens in Assam, he said it's not about expelling people but about identifying the citizens. ""There is no place for Hindus in the world except India,"" sources said quoting him. Asked about homosexuality, an issue on which the view of the Hindutva organisation has evolved over time, Bhagwat said it's a ""variation"" and not an ""abnormality"". ""They should be treated as equal human beings and integrated into society,"" the RSS chief said. About incidents of mob lynching, Bhagwat said the RSS condemns all forms of violence and its volunteers should try to stop such incidents. ""If a swayamsevak is found guilty, we will disown him and law should follow its own course,"" he said. Bhagwat, under whose stewardship the RSS has opened up comparatively, also told foreign journalists that his organisation will never be a political body and ""the Hindutva it espouses is about unity in diversity"". With the organisation being the ideological fountainhead of the ruling BJP, many critics accuse that the RSS of being a political organisation, despite its assertions to the contrary. To a question about economy which has seen a slowdown, Bhagwat said that there was ""no policy paralysis"" since Narendra Modi became prime minister but added that the RSS is not an expert on the issue, sources said. The interaction lasted for around two-and-a-half hours. It started with brief introduction given by Bhagwat, followed by a question-and-answer session covering a wide range of issues across the spectrum, according to the statement by the RSS. Around 80 journalists representing more than 50 organisations and hailing from 30 countries attended the interaction, it said. RSS general secretary Suresh (Bhaiyyaji) Joshi, joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya, Krishan Gopal, RSS northern region in-charge Bajran Lal Gupt and its Delhi unit head Kulbhushan Ahuja were also present in the interaction programme.

Maharashtra assembly elections 2019: Article 370 pitch could make a big difference in over 130 urban seats | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Article 370 will be the leitmotif of the BJP’s ‘Nation First’ campaign for the assembly elections. BJP’s poll pundits have drawn up a poll agenda, with defanging of Article 370 and triple talaq as key issues to woo voters, and CM Devendra Fadnavis’s development-oriented stint of five years. The party’s core group is in talks with two leading ad agencies to work out the nitty-gritty of the agenda, sources said on Monday. Govt revokes Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, bifurcates state into two Union TerritoriesThe BJP leadership feels the Article 370 pitch will go down well with urban voters who can tilt the scales in favour of the party in 132 of the total 288 assembly constituencies. “The rural heartland is abuzz with issues such as irrigation, water scarcity and support prices for foodgrains,” said a party strategist. This explains why Union home minister Amit Shah, at a BJP conclave in the city, went hammer and tongs against Jawaharlal Nehru for   turning J&amp;K into a “disputed territory”   . Recalling the role played by the party’s icons, Shah said Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee was clamped into prison by Sheikh Abdullah’s regime, where the former died. Shah stated that for the BJP, nullifying of Article 370 was about integrating Kashmir with India. “It’s about patriotism,” he added. But the opposition is peeved with BJP for giving precedence to patriotism over price rise, ‘deshbhakti’ over drought. NCP MP Supriya Sule said, “Why should BJP drag Article 370 into the state elections? This is like Fadnavis copying from Modi and Shah’s notebook. The BJP perhaps thinks Fadnavis’s regime hasn’t done much at the ground level, in terms of tackling agrarian issues, keeping prices of essential commodities under control and ensuring Mumbai is free of potholes.” Pointing out that BJP had every right, with an unprecedented mandate, to defang Article 370, Sule said, “But the Centre’s high-handed manner has been a matter of concern. The situation in J&K is grave. We have lost contact with our friends. People have been gagged. Tourism is in a shambles. Shah should also talk about this.” Stating that Kashmir was an integral part of India, Aslam Shaikh, Congress MLA from Malvani, said there was nothing wrong in Shah holding forth on Article 370. “But development and economic issues should set the poll agenda of every party,” he added. The urban chaos sparked by metro projects and the Aarey row may have prompted BJP to lay emphasis on Article 370, said a bureaucrat. “Projects are adding to pedestrians’ and motorists’ woes. The ‘development’ agenda is caught in a bind. The patriotism card can help blunt the edge of anti-government sentiment,” he said. Some civil society members are worried too. “Playing the patriotism card to impress voters is fraught with risk and could trigger jingoism,” said Manisha Tikekar, former head of the political science department at SIES college. “We have failed to deepen the content of our democracy,” she added.

 BJP rejects Congress charge against PM | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Tuesday rejected Congress leader Anand Sharma's charge that the Prime Minister campaigned for US President Donald Trump in his Houston. ""The Prime Minister was not campaigning in that sense. One must remember that Trump had used Ab ki baar, Trump Sarkaar statement or this phrase with regard to some function possibly Diwali with the Indian-American community last time. ""And, if the Prime Minister recalls it, it is not a campaign. It always appears that the Congress party would like to continue its policy of criticising anything and everything, and trying to find faults when non-exist. It seems to be there new found agenda...,"" BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli told ANI. The Congress on Monday accused Modi of violating a time-honoured principle of Indian foreign policy, saying he is in the US as India's Prime Minister and not as a star campaigner in the elections there. livebudget updatesmoreupdates""There is a time-honoured convention of India's foreign policy that when we engage with foreign governments or the Prime Minister and the President are on foreign soil, we do not take a partisan position on domestic electoral politics,"" said Anand Sharma while addressing a press conference. Kolhli also lauded Modi for championing his government's decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir's decades-old special status while addressing the Indian community in Houston. He slammed Pakistan for interfering in India's internal issues and not doing enough to curb the menace of terrorism. ""It was a magnificent and historic occasion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji speaking on a host of issues, informing people and bringing up Article 370 is commendable. A standing ovation for that. President Trump while with the Prime Minister recognized the issue which clearly displayed the fact that India and United States share a common vision on many things, including the concern on terrorism and the concern related to India's border...All of this reaffirms strong bonds between the two leaders and the two countries,"" he said. ""Simultaneously for Pakistan, there is also a clear message. Pakistan should be more concerned about its people, rather than building a narrative of falsehood and interfering in India's internal matters. How long would it like to continue on the path of forcing itself into India's internal matters, encouraging terrorism and becoming an epicenter of terror... It is trying to build a false narrative which is not based on facts... The world has recognized it and is no longer taking note of this negative thing in Pakistan's favour,"" Kohli added. The Prime Minister while addressing 'Howdy, Mody!' event, attended by 50,000 Indian Americans at Houston, deftly reminded the gathering about how India is connected with the US President. ""...And he has already made the American economy strong again. He has achieved much for the US and for the world. Friends, we in India have connected well with America.

" Paramilitary forces gearing up to fight winters, skin diseases in Kashmir valley | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The paramilitary forces, which were deployed in large numbers to tackle violence and protests before the abrogation of the Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, are now gearing up to battle extreme cold weather as they would be operating in the sub-zero degree temperatures. Around 40,000 additional troops were deployed in the valley last month.  Apart from fulfilling clothing requirement of the troops belonging mainly to the CRPF along with the BSF, ITBP and other forces, the forces have also planned major procedural changes to prevent skin diseases or any other infection for the troops.  The force has asked suggestions on the new proposal of Extra Issue Clothing (EIC) items blanket, shirt, Angola (warm pant and shirt) etc which will be given to force personnel deployed in the tough terrain.  As per an official communication accessed by ANI, the CRPF said that the winter clothing also known as extra issue clothing is issued to personnel in winter conditions.  ""It is well conversant that since these items are not earmarked for any particular person. Hence it is rotated and the same item is used by different personnel, till completion of the life of the EIC items. Many personnel do not feel comfortable to wear/use the old winter clothes used by other personnel and this procedure can also spread skin/infections diseases among the force personnel,"" the official communication states.  In view of the heavy deployment of the force personnel, CRPF has now decided to review the procedure. It is expected that now the clothing will be handed over to troops for not less than three years to prevent infection and disease.  A decision is expected by this week on the proposal based on suggestions received by CRPF.  After the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, almost 40,000 troops were deployed in Jammu and Kashmir to maintain law and order situation. Apart from CRPF, ITBP, CISF etc have also been sent to Kashmir.  While, on the one hand, CRPF is doing procedural changes, on the other side all company commanders have been asked to intimate availability of clothing.

HP government rolls out online module for Section 118 clearances on land | Shimla News - Times of India,"DHARAMSHALA: The issue of Section 118 of Himachal remained in lime light ever since Union government defanged Article 370, giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir. In a landmark decision, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has rolled out the online module of permissions under Section 118 of HP Tenancy and Land Reforms Act 1972, starting from Mandi. In Himachal, outsiders are not allowed to purchase land. They have to seek special permissions from state authorities to do so. In most of the cases, cabinet used to give such approvals. Even the person who is a resident of Himachal and has no agricultural land has to take such permissions despite having bonafide certificates. It was on Sunday, that chief minister while speaking on the occasion at Mandi said that this module would go a long way in speedy disposal of Section 118 cases. He said this module would also ensure transparency in the process of approval regarding Section 118 cases. He said that the Section 118 was imposed in the state to safeguard the farmers. He said that it also creates hurdle in expediting the pace of development due to cumbersome procedure and delay in approvals. “State government has not made any changes or amendments to Section 118, but was only in favor of making the process a bit simple and transparent. The clearances of Section 118 have now been made online so that the people could get it done at the earliest,"" he said adding that this project has been started on pilot basis from Mandi district.

"JP Nadda says Article 370, tax reforms to be BJP poll planks in Maharashtra | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: The BJP’s working president J P Nadda on Monday launched the party’s election campaign in the city and made it clear that its key planks across Maharashtra would be the revocation of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status, tax reforms and a corruption-free state government. “Maharashtra’s image was tarnished because of the corrupt practices of the previous leaders, who could not provide a stable government. The chief minister’s post was reduced to a musical chair and the leaders were fighting to secure it,” he said, while addressing a rally of BJP workers and booth leaders under the banner of the “Vijay Sankalp Melava”. Nadda said the Centre’s decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir would be a reason for citizens to cheer. He said: “Not only people in Maharashtra, but also those living in other parts of country are welcoming the move. The delimitation of the state will be done in way to make governance and the Assembly more inclusive. The tribal regions and castes from J&K will get representation in the Assembly.” Nadda also accused the parties now in the Opposition of misusing power when they had it. He said: “All that led to their decline. Most of the leaders in the Opposition parties are either in jail or out on bail now.” Nadda said BJP was the “only party in the country with a democratic structure,” where people could get plump posts “without having to market their caste or creed”. He said: “The decision making process in the BJP is based on a consensus. Other parties are ‘family parties’ and their members run the show.” The BJP leaders said they have designed a 9-point agenda for the Maharashtra elections and would organize a campaign between September 25 and October 2.

"J&amp;K move will benefit Sachin Pilot &amp; his wife, says Nitin Gadkari | Jaipur News - Times of India","JAIPUR: Taking a dig at deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said the Congress leader, who is married to former J&K chief minister and National Conference (NC) leader Farooq Abdullah’s daughter, would benefit from the recent move to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Stating that he was not making any ‘political comments’, Gadkari said Abdullah’s daughter would now have equal rights on her father’s property. Earlier, if a girl from the Valley married an Indian, she would lose her property rights and citizenship.The personal remark was made by the Union minister at a meeting on ‘One Nation, One Constitution’, part of BJP’s national campaign, at the Birla Auditorium on Monday. During his nearly 40-minute speech, he also referred to Sachin Pilot at least twice as Rajesh Pilot. “Rajesh Pilotji (Sachin) is married to the daughter of Farooq Abdullah. The J&K has a provision that if the girl of the Valley married an Indian, she will tend to lose her property rights and citizenship of the Valley. Since this law (Article 370) has been abrogated, Farooq Abdullah’s son and daughter will get an equal share in his property. I believe that our government has benefited Rajesh Pilotji (Sachin).” He also repeatedly held the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru responsible for creating the ‘problem’ of J&K. “Nehru’s appeasement policy was responsible for the addition of special provisions under the Article 370 which was a constitutional fraud,” he said. He claimed that several Congress leaders, including B R Ambedkar, opposed Nehru’s move to grant special status. “Nehru had sent Sheikh Abdullah to convince Ambedkar to prepare the draft of Article 370, which the latter had refused. This is very well documented in history. Nehru had forced the Parliament to pass the law which started the complex web of problems,” Gadkari said. He said the Bhartiya Jana Sangh and BJP had batted for the removal of special status and elaborated the role of Syama Prasad Mukherjee in raising the issue. “Mukherjee’s sacrifice after his arrest in Srinagar motivated the country to work for ‘Ek Desh (one country), Ek Vidhan (one law), Ek Pradhan (one leader), and Ek Nishan (one symbol). BJP under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has achieved the aim. This will provide economic opportunities, social justice and welfare schemes required for overall development,” Gadkari said amid chanting of slogans ‘Jaha hue balidan Mukherjee, woh Kashmir hamara hai (Kashmir where Mukherjee died, that Kashmir belongs to India). Elaborating on government plans for the Valley, Gadkrai said that different ministries of the government were all set to initiate developmental schemes to pull the majority of Kashmiris out of poverty. “The move will attract investments, especially in the tourism sector. Now the hotels of Udaipur or Jaipur can buy land and provide world-class hotels to promote tourism. NAFED has also decided to purchase all apples and honey from Kashmiri farmers to make them prosperous,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 A win-win show for Modi and Trump | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In front of a massive gathering of the Indian diaspora and with US president Donald Trump in attendance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held out the message that India would remain a globalised, pluralistic and diverse power. The ‘Howdy Modi’ show in Houston was a dream that successive Indian governments have had – a show of Indian power in American heartland, propped up by its educated, wealthy diaspora. Modi did well to mobilise the power of the Indian diaspora and pull it through. While the Indian community, traditional backers of the Democratic Party, cheered the Trump, the US president used the opportunity for some political hard sell, almost a year before he is to seek re-election. Without high level intervention, Texas, a traditionally Republican state, is believed to be slipping into the hands of the Democrats. If the responses were anything to go by, Trump found that the Indian-American community was more about legal immigration, and that they stood solidly against “radical Islamic terrorism”. Modi, for the record, has refused to link terror to any religion. For India, the gains are more subtle. The value of the Indian community goes beyond soft power. Indian-Americans are the largest source of remittances but that’s not all. While India sees them as something like a “knowledge bridge” to leverage technology, capital and influence for India’s development, there are other underlying tones – The cohort is willing to support Modi so long as India remains part of the globalised world, with an economy, open to trade and investment. A protectionist and autarchic India will not hold the same attraction. It was no coincidence that the Modi government slashed corporate taxes and announced a slew of measures to pull up the economy by the socks, just on the eve of the PM’s departure for the US. It also means that India will try hard to stitch a trade agreement with the US in the coming days, even though a big energy deal over the weekend might be all India can take home. Modi began his speech by speaking in almost 10 Indian languages, in his own way resolving the language controversy that erupted back home in recent days. The Trump-Modi warmth on display helps India keep the Kashmir narrative focused on two points – that the nullification of Article 370 was about the twin imperatives of development and national security/terrorism. Earlier, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had told an interviewer: “We revoked a temporary constitutional provision that slowed down development, created alienation, led to separatism, fed terrorism and ended up as a deadly national security problem.” International support will hinge on India being able to keep violence down and demonstrate economic development in J&K. For everyone who watched the show, Modi owned the stage. Trump’s presence and Modi’s effusive paeans to the US president set the stage for both leaders to play to their respective political audiences from a shared platform. Perhaps, the Indian side could have got more Congressmen and senators to attend, but sources said Trump’s presence and an election year made that difficult. India seemed to have bet on Trump for the present, with Modi reminding him of his 2016 slogan. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Ready to mediate on Kashmir if India and Pakistan agree: Trump | India News - Times of India,"NEW YORK: Describing himself as ""an extremely good arbitrator"", US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he was ready to mediate between Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue, but both sides have to agree on that. Trump made the remarks during his meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in New York. ""If I can help, I will certainly help,"" Trump said, describing the Kashmir issue as a ""complex"" one which has been going on for a long time. ""If both (Pakistan and India) want, I am ready to do it,"" he said, a day after attending 'Howdy, Modi' rally in Houston, where he shared the stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and displayed a close friendship and a common vision on fighting terrorism. ""At any point of time, I would be an extremely good arbitrator,"" he said. Trump praised the 'Howdy, Modi' mega rally in presence of Khan and said he has heard a ""very aggressive statement"" by Prime Minister Modi. ""It was very well received within the room,"" Trump said, referring to the gathering of 50,000 people at the NRG stadium in Houston. At the rally on Sunday, PM Modi hit out at Pakistan for its support to terrorism and said India's decision to nullify Article 370 has caused trouble to those who cannot handle their country as he called for a ""decisive battle"" against terrorism. During his press interaction alongside Khan, Trump repeatedly snubbed Pakistani reporters and on one occasion even asked one of the journalists whether he is part of the Pakistani delegation. ""Where do you find reporters like these,"" Trump asked Khan in response to a question posed by a Pakistani journalist on Kashmir. Prime Minister Khan, who has declared himself an ambassador of Kashmiris, on Sunday briefed US lawmakers, scholars, human rights activists and the media on the repercussions of India revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5. Trump and Imran last met in July at the White House. During their first one-on-one interaction, the US president had expressed his willingness to mediate between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue - an offer India rejected. During Modi's meeting with President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in France last month, the Prime Minister categorically rejected any scope for third party mediation between India and Pakistan on Kashmir. ""All the issues between India and Pakistan are of bilateral in nature, and we don't want to trouble any third country. We can discuss and resolve these issues bilaterally,"" Modi had said. On his part, Trump had said he and PM Modi spoke about Kashmir ""at great length"" during the G7 Summit and he feels that both India and Pakistan can resolve it on their own. His comments on Kashmir in the French city of Biarritz was seen as an apparent backtracking from his earlier comments, offering mediation. Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after India abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. India's action evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian Ambassador. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". New Delhi has also asked Islamabad to accept the reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Army chief rejects 'clampdown' claim in Jammu and Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: The chief of Army staff General Bipin Rawat on Monday rejected claims of a clampdown in Jammu and Kashmir and asserted that it was a facade put up by terrorists to project a false picture of ""harsh measures"" to the outside world. In reality, the violence and killings were down and the terrorists were being kept at bay, he told reporters. While communication lines are through for the people, there is a breakdown for handlers of terrorists in Pakistan and their associates in the Valley, he said. Also, arrangements are in place for the security forces to talk to their families and there is no communication breakdown, he said. Assuring further gradual easing of the situation, he said,""to say there is a clampdown, I don't agree with this."" Listing a whole gamut of economic activities in the Kashmir valley, from movement of apple laden trucks to other parts of the country, operation of brick kilns and sand transportation through trucks after its procurement from the Jhelum river, he said ""obviously people are coming out."" Flights were being operated in and out of Srinagar and other modes of transport like taxis were functional, he said and wanted to know if these could happen in a lockdown scenario. ""You can go to apple orchards and you can see heaps of apples that have been plucked and packed into boxes and being transported out of Valley... ...hundreds of trucks have come out. Who is plucking these apples? Who is packing them into boxes, who is loading them into these trucks? And who takes the trucks out from the Valley? he asked. The Army chief wondered how all such economic activities could happen in a clampdown situation. ""How are people moving out? So this clampdown is a facade which is being created by terrorists who don't want things to operate."" ""A facade has been created through a fear psychosis ... by terrorists and they want to project to the people of Kashmir and the rest of India that harsh measures were being undertaken which is not the truth and far from reality,"" he said. On the claim of closure of shops, he said outlets were being operated through rear doors as terrorists threaten the shopkeepers to down shutters. ""They want to show and project to everybody outside that there is a clampdown. In reality, people are buying essential commodities like dal and rice and they are cooking food in their homes,"" he added. Hitting out at Pakistan for state sponsored terrorism and its repeated attempts to push in terrorists, especially after abrogation of Article 370, he said the neighbouring country carried out ceasefire violations to facilitate terrorists' infiltration. ""...ceasefire violations are done to make our vigil fail...so these ceasefire violations keep happening."" Asserting that the Army knew ways to deal with ceasefire violations, he said as a mechanism is in place to protect jawans from being hit by shelling during such times, Pakistan chooses civilians as targets to support terrorists. In view of intelligence inputs, lots of incidents of violence were being prevented, which would have otherwise affected the life and property of people there, he pointed out. While soldiers man the borders, it is also important to incorporate technology in surveillance and a lot of emphasis is now being given for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, called ISR, he said. ""We are now developing better techniques to see how we can ensure the sanctity of our borders with the soldiers present there on the ground being empowered with technology in whatever form we can give to them,"" he said. Answering a query, he blamed disruptive elements for misrepresenting Islam, prompting sections of people to get swayed by it. ""I think it is important that we have preachers who convey the correct meaning of Islam..."", he said. To a question on China and claims of border incursions, he said it was due to differing perceptions of the Line of Actual Control. ""I think with China, we worked out some very good mechanisms on how to ensure peace and tranquility,"" he said, recalling the first informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wuhan in China last year when an understanding was reached in respect of border perceptions.

 Howdy Modi: When Article 370 took centrestage in India and abroad | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: After August 5 and 6, when Parliament had nullified it, Article 370 would not have been discussed as much worldwide as it was done on September 22. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi raked it up in Houston in the presence of US President Donald Trump during ‘Howdy, Modi’ event, BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah exclusively broached it in Mumbai earlier in the afternoon. The abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution in the monsoon session of Parliament remained a talking point in the country and abroad since morning to late Sunday night and even later. While talking about scrapping of Article 370, Narendra Modi even discussed, without taking Pakistan’s name, how the neighbouring country was sponsoring terrorism in the world. Narendra ModiDuring his address at the mega event, Modi played on the words “welfare” and “farewell”. He talked about welfare measures that have been undertaken by his BJP government. In the same breath, he also enlisted the things which had been bid “farewell” by his government. In that context Narendra Modi said farewell has been given to Article 370. ""Article 370 had deprived people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh of development. Terror and separatist elements were misusing the situation. Now people there have got equal rights,"" he said. He hit out at Pakistan and said some people had problems with the nullification of Article 370. ""These are the same people who could not govern their own country properly. These are the same people who shield terrorism and nurture it. The whole world knows them very well,"" Modi said. Narendra Modi said be it the 9/11 terror attack in the US in 2001 and 26/11 Mumbai attack in 2008, the masterminds behind them were all found in one country [Pakistan]. Amit ShahA few hours before the prime minister addressed ‘Howdy, Modi’ event, Amit Shah spoke at a seminar in Mumbai on Modi government’s “historical decision” to abrogate Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir. Explaining the significance of the programme, Amit Shah said it was the first one after the Election Commission had declared assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana. While elections are being held in Maharashtra and Haryana, Amit Shah’s main focus remained scrapping of Articles 370 and 35A which were related to Jammu and Kashmir. Moreover, while PM Modi linked Article 370 to terrorism being sponsored by Pakistan, Amit Shah connected it to nationalism and how it was significant in the forthcoming assembly elections. He appealed to the people of Maharashtra to decide once and for all whether they were in favour of abrogation of Article 370 and 35A or against it. It is an opportunity to the voters of the state, he added. “This is the first election after the abrogation of Article 370. There are political formations - one belongs to the BJP and its allies which considers Bharat Mata as everything. On the other hand, there are dynastic parties Congress and NCP for whom their families are considered as everything,” Amit Shah said adding that the people of Maharashtra had to decide whether they wished to support the “nationalist parties” or the “dynastic parties”. Shah said the fight for “swaraj” (self rule) against the Mughals had started by Shivaji from Maharashtra and which covered Afghanistan, Gujarat and the South. “I appeal to the people of Maharashtra to show those people who oppose abrogation of 370 their place,” he said. He exhorted the Maharashtra unit of the BJP to not think that their task had finished after abrogation of Article 370. “But our work starts now after the Article 370 has been abrogated. We have to work for taking the country on a nationalist path,” he said asking all party workers to take a pledge and visit the houses of every resident with the message about abrogation of Article 370. He said the sacrifice of Jan Sangh’s first president Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who had died in Kashmir in mysterious circumstances, should not go in vain.

India PoK:  Indian Army Chief: Army war-gamed possible PoK action; plans ready: Army Chief General Bipin Rawat | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Sep 23, 2019)NEW DELHI: The Army has war-gamed any possible action in Pakistan occupied Kashmir and has accordingly made plans for it, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat said on Sunday. Rawat, who shared the development during an exclusive interaction with ET, said Pakistan will avoid a conventional war with India because it does not have adequate capabilities for it. He added it will instead continue to increase its proxy war against India. The Army chief also said Pakistan has acknowledged supporting terrorism in J&K and it is doing this under the garb of helping the local population. Pakistan is hungry for ‘attention’ and is adamant about ensuring third-party intervention on the Kashmir issue, he added. While speaking about possible action in PoK, Rawat said: “The Army’s 15 Corps performs war games and it is not only on defending land. Some of them would involve going across. Even 14 Corps does such war games. So, there are plans.” The Srinagar-based 15 Corps, besides being largely involved in counter-terrorist operations, has operational tasks against India’s western neighbour. The 14 Corps, based in Leh, is involved in operations not only on the western front, but on the eastern one with China as well. The officer also said the focus should now be taken away from J&K and be placed on the other side. “It is important to take the heat off J&K. It would have to be taken to the other side — PoK and Gilgit Baltistan,” he said. Earlier this month, Rawat had said the Army was always ready for any action in PoK, should the government pass orders for it. Several top leaders in the government have recently commented on PoK as well. Defence minister Rajnath Singh said last month that talks with Pakistan will only happen on PoK. A few days ago, external affairs minister S Jaishankar made it clear that PoK was a part of India and New Delhi will have jurisdiction over it one day. When asked about a conventional threat from Pakistan, Rawat explained, “It is not strong conventionally. Pakistan will avoid conventional and increase proxy. He will incite us through proxy and compel us to take action. He wants attention and thirdparty or multiple party intervention.” On Pakistan’s response following the withdrawal of Article 370, the officer said: “Pakistan is saying that it will fight India through terrorism. It is an acknowledgement of its support to terrorism in J&K under the garb of supporting people of J&K.” Rawat, while referring to Pak PM’s statement during his US trip in July that about 40,000 terrorists were present in the country, said it had activated terrorist launch pads along the LoC. “They may attempt to send some terrorist modules into our country and say it is due to the anger of the Kashmiris.” In Video:Army Chief hits out at Pakistan for misusing 'Islam'Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"In Mukerian contest, BJP to bank on Article 370, Hindu vote | Ludhiana News - Times of India","JALANDHAR: This bypoll season, the BJP is going to bank on Hindu majority Mukerian’s nationalistic zest by talking Article 370 abrogation and of course Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mukerian was one assembly segment of Hoshiarpur parliamentary constituency where BJP got the highest lead of 37,706 votes and bagged party candidate Som Parkash a huge victory. BJP experts believe that with a high number of ex-servicemen in the constituency, nationalistic fervour would work in the party’s favour. “We hope that talking about PM Modi and abrogation of Article 370 besides raising issues concerning the non-performance of the Congress government in Punjab would give us an edge,” said a senior BJP leader. Congress on the other hand is in tight spot. In 2017, it was SAD-BJP that faced antiincumbency, and now chief minister Amarinder Singhled government’s performance is under the scanner after completion of half of its term. Questions are being raised on the matter from within the party lines as whiffs of brewing discontent in the party are coming to the fore, experts said. Meanwhile, the saffron party is all set to face some grilling questions about the economic slump. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"‘People don’t want caste, dynasty, regional politics’ | Chandigarh News - Times of India","Captain Abhimanyu says Cong has given an impression it depends solely on ex-CM Hooda by making him its face again. He tells Ajay Sura defections to BJP show people’s moodWill ex-CM Bhupinder Hooda’s return as main leader of the Congress have an impact on the BJP’s prospects in assembly polls?The Congress will face a huge loss in the assembly polls because of Hooda’s resurgence. By making him the party face in the upcoming polls, the Congress high command has given an impression that it is depending only on the Hooda family in the state. Hooda stood against his party’s ideology, especially on Article 370 and other issues, still the Congress succumbed to his blackmail tactics and pressure. The Congress should have learnt lessons from their loss in the 2014 assembly polls, but unfortunately they did not. They have again succumbed to the same kind of politics just to face another humiliating defeat in the 2019 polls. The Congress’s former state president Ashok Tanwar was beaten up, former CLP leader did not get any cooperation and even voting in the Rajya Sabha polls was not done as per the party’s high command’s directives. Who is your captain in the upcoming assembly polls?Manohar Lal Khattar is our captain in the assembly polls. He has proved himself in the past five years. After the 2014 elections, he has not only changed the government, but also tried to change the system. There is no doubt or dispute in our party over leadership. Haryana is all set to witness end of dynasties, caste and regional politics after these elections. Article 370, transparency in government jobs and good governance would be our main issues. A large number of turncoats have joined BJP. Being an old-time leader of the party, how do you see this development?I would say, people as well as political leaders of the state are against dynasty or family politics. Most of those who have joined the BJP are from the INLD, which was a family party. Leaders are choosing the BJP because they want the state free from three malaise — caste, dynasty and regional politics. Will the 2016 Jat quota stir violence have any impact on the upcoming elections?It is now clear that people related to the former chief minister (referring to Bhupinder Singh Hooda) and members of his team were involved in that violence. But unfortunately, they never expressed repentance for that. The incident still weighs heavily on people’s minds and I am sure that those involved in that incident would suffer loss because of that in the elections. When will the list of BJP candidates be released?The process to finalize the candidates started from Sunday. The panel of candidates has been received and after initial screening, it would be sent to the party’s central committee for the final approval. The main BJP committee of which the state CM, state BJP president, Prime Minister, national BJP president and the party in charge are members will give the final approval. The candidates would be finalized on the basis of their winnability, ability to attract crowds during the Jan Ashirwad Yatra and the opinion of party workers and organization. How do you see Dushyant Chautala’s JJP performing in the assembly polls?I think, they have not been accepted by the society. Dushyant became an MP just because of his family and party setup by his grandfather, but he deceived both the family and the party. In our society, in Haryana, family and social norms are kept on a higher pedestal, but founders of the JJP failed both. This was the reason that public rejected them in the parliamentary polls. Do you believe that state has had a weak opposition in the past five years?I believe nobody from the opposition could raise any issue in the past five years. The reason was that they not only failed to understand the pulse of the people but also lacked credibility in their eyes. Some of them could not come out of their castles. These were the reasons that today there is onesided environment in the state in favour of BJP which was able to catch the public pulse because of its connectivity to the masses in these five years. What is financial position of the state at present, especially as the state’s debt liability has increased?In prudent fiscal management, Haryana is one of the best managed states. The state used to pay Rs 13,296 crore for salaries plus DA in 2014-15 and we are paying Rs 21,902 crore in 2019-20. This is a 65% increase. Similarly, there is an increase of 102% in payment of pensions and 253% rise in payment of social security pensions in five years. We have saved Rs 1,178 crore by identifying ghost beneficiaries through direct transfer of funds into Aadhaar-linked accounts. Nearly 1.75 lakh fake beneficiaries were also identified and removed. The previous government was paying Rs 6,928 crore as interest on debt, but we are paying Rs 6,633 crore as interest annually on debt. The previous government was returning Rs 2,357 crore annually as principal amount towards debt but we are paying Rs 7,257 crore annually. Overall, we are maintaining good financial health and are ready to debate on it. But the problem is that nobody from opposition is ready to discuss this.

BJP faces fractured opposition in Hamirpur by poll | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: The BJP will face its first acid test on Monday when Hamirpur goes to by poll, necessitated following conviction of sitting BJP MLA Ashok Singh Chandel in a 22-year-old murder case. Riding high on over whelming performance in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir and completion of two-and-a-half year of rule in UP, the BJP will face an otherwise fractured opposition with the two regional giants, SP and BSP, breaking their tie up they stitched to arrest the juggernaut of the saffron party in the general elections. While the BJP has placed its bet on a Thakur, Yuvraj Singh, the SP and Congress have fielded OBC candidates -- Manoj Prajapati and Hardeepak Nishad, respectively. The BSP has played the Muslim card by fielding its zonal coordinator Naushad Ali in a bid to corner minority votes. Despite its defeats in the byelections in Gorakhpur, Phulpur, Kairana and Noorpur last year, the BJP is confident of retaining the Hamirpur seat. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said that the voters would not be swayed by caste politics of the opposition parties and would instead give weightage to the governance of Yogi Adityanath government in the state and Narendra Modi government at the centre. ""A number of projects including an expressway and defence corridor had been initiated by the state government for the Bundelkhand region. People understand which party thinks of their welfare,"" he said. BJP sources said that the party hopes of cornering the upper caste votes while relying on division of OBCs and Muslim vote bank amongst the opposition parties. The SP leadership, however, maintains that there would be no division of votes. ""We would be getting votes of every section of society. The result would show that,"" said SP state president Naresh Uttam Patel, while speaking to TOI. The BSP, which is contesting a by poll after a gap of more than a decade, banks on consolidation of Muslims and its core dalit vote bank. BSP state president Munquad Ali said that their would not be any division of Muslims. ""Earlier there was a possibility of Muslims getting divided but now they know that their welfare lay in siding with the BSP,"" he said. Ali said that his party stood for the welfare of Sarv Samaj and therefore its candidate would garner votes from a cross section of communities. The Congress leadership hopes of getting the local support in a considerable way. UP Congress committee general secretary Dwijendra Tripathi said that the party candidate is a local worker of Congress and wields considerable influence in the region. ""It is the BJP and other opposition parties which does politics of caste and religion,"" he said. Political experts said that a four cornered fight in Hamirpur would set the tone for all political parties in the by polls for 11 seats due next month. ""The political scenario has changed completely after SP and BSP broke their tie up. It would be a four cornered fight in all 13 seats, including Hamirpur,"" said an expert.

"Amit Shah: Jammu and Kashmir a disputed territory due to Nehru, says Shah | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: BJP chief and Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday made it clear that Centre’s decision to abolish ‘special status’ for J&K by nullifying Article 370 will be one of the key planks of BJP’s Maharashtra campaign. “My Mumbai lecture is the first programme for BJP in the Maharashtra polls. It coincides with the Jan Sampark Abhiyaan on the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, which is being held across the country,” said Shah at a BJP rally in Goregaon. At the gathering, organised as part of a lecture series BJP has organised across the country to gin up the already-formidable support for Centre’s moves on J&K, Shah also blamed Congress’s icon, Jawahar Lal Nehru, for turning the sensitive border state into a disputed territory by opting for a ceasefire with Pakistan when the Army was poised to wrest control of the entire territory from Pakistan-backed invaders. BJP’s focus on Nehru’s ‘blunder’— which Shah contrasted with the “resoluteness” with which Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the country’s first home minister who occupies a prominent place in saffron iconography — will rile Congress as well as its ally NCP. Shah, who pushed for the extinction of ‘separate status’ for J&K, said Patel died in 1950 and in 1952 the Delhi pact was signed between Nehru and Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah, laying the ground for Articles 370 and 35 A. Shah said three generations of BJP netas had laid down their lives for Kashmir. Recalling one of the party’s icons, Dr Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, he said, “Mookerjee went to Kashmir. He was put in jail by Sheikh Abdullah’s government where he died. And thus, he became the first martyr for the cause of Kashmir.” In Video:Amit Shah blames Jawaharlal Nehru for PoK's existenceDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 211 held under PSA compared to 921 after Burhan Wani’s death | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: There has been a substantial reduction in the application of the “draconian” Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) in the aftermath of the defanging of Article 370 on August 5. PSA is a defensive detention law that allows keeping a person perceived to be a threat to law & order in custody without trial for two years. As many as 921 people were slapped with PSA in the six weeks following the killing of Hizb terrorist Burhan Wani in 2016. However, in 2019, after the Centre took away the special status of J&K, the use of the same act has been drastically reduced to 211 instances (in the same timeframe). The government did not approve 21 detentions. While 102 were detained under PSA in 2016 in the Jammu region, which has historically remained peaceful in comparison to the Kashmir Valley, only 19 have been detained in the region this year. The 2016 shutdown in Kashmir was imposed by Pakistan-backed separatists over the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in an encounter with security forces, whereas the 2019 lockdown was initiated by the Centre on August 5 in conjunction with the revocation of the special status of J&K. Though police have detained many overground workers of terror groups and politicians, who had threatened violence if the Centre went ahead with its decision to read down Article 370, as per civil administration data accessed exclusively by TOI, for the first six weeks of crises in both the years, the number of detentions under PSA in 2019 remains extremely low compared to that in 2016. The government had filed responses in 661 cases in SC and the J&K HC in the first two months of Wani’s killing. In 2019, post-nullification of special status, the government has responded to petitions in only 16 cases (till September 19). In an unprecedented move, the government booked former CM and parliamentarian Farooq Abdullah under PSA last week for “activities prejudicial to maintenance of public order”. He remains detained at his home, which has been declared as a sub-jail, for past 12 days. His case will go to the advisory board after the home department issues a formal notification. The board is authorised to fix the period of detention. Abdullah was slapped with PSA on the ground that he had made 12 inflammatory statements ahead of the August 5 decision with an aim to incite violence. Among other reasons that the government cited to book him under PSA was Abdullah’s support to separatists, including JKLF terrorist Yasin Malik, on several occasions. An official in Srinagar said, “The fact remains that even as the government used PSA generously in 2016, we were not able to control violence in the Valley. That’s because the government at the time did not seem to know who the biggest kingpins of mobilising youth and inciting violence were. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

He said the Article 370 is a political issue for the Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi while for the BJP abrogation of Article 370 and 35A is part of its effort to keep country undivided.  ""Rahul Gandhi says Article 370 is a political issue. Rahul Baba, you have come into politics now, but three generations of the BJP have given their life for Kashmir, for the abrogation of Article 370. It is not a political matter for us.

""Forty thousand people were killed and Kashmiri pundits, Sufis, and Sikhs were driven out from the state in 10 years between 1990 and 2000. Rahul Gandhi cares about his vote bank and how to remain in power and hence is not moved by it. However, the sacrifice of 40,000 people is like a pain in our heart,"" he said.  He also said the issue of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) is because of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru announcing ""untimely ceasefire"" with Pakistan.  ""The issue of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) would not have been there had the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru did not announce an untimely ceasefire in 1947 when the Army was strongly fighting against Pakistani infiltrators in Jammu and Kashmir,"" said Shah.

 BJP raising Article 370 to divert attention from 'monumental failures' in Jharkhand: Hemant Soren | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The BJP is raising the issue of abrogation of Article 370 provisions in the run up to the Jharkhand Assembly polls as a ""ploy"" to divert people's attention from ""monumental failures"" of the Raghubar Das government, JMM working president Hemant Soren alleged on Sunday. The former Jharkhand chief minister's sharp attack comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah referred to Article 370 abrogation while listing the achievements of the NDA government 2.0 in their public addresses in the poll-bound state. Soren said the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) will raise people's issues in the campaign and promised that if voted to power, his government will ensure 75 per cent reservation for the youth of Jharkhand in private jobs. In an interview to , he said if JMM forms the government, it will ensure five lakh jobs within one year, unemployment allowance to those who are jobless, reserve government tender up to Rs 25 crore for people from the state, implement 50 per cent reservation for women in jobs and 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Asked about the BJP aggressively raising the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the nationalistic fervour around it, Soren said a government which fails to address economic and social crises and key issues that affect everyday lives of citizens, resorts to ""creating sharp polarisation in the society"". ""Lightning doesn't strike a place twice and similarly the BJP cannot fool the people all the time. Raising the issue of Article 370 during state assembly polls campaign is nothing but the BJP's ploy to divert people's attention from its monumental failures in governance in Jharkhand,"" the Leader of the Opposition in the Jharkhand Assembly said. Modi might have been successful in securing an NDA victory based on the post-Pulwama and Balakot nationalistic fervour, but the people of Jharkhand have had enough of this ""apathetic"" state government and are waiting to throw it out in the upcoming assembly polls, he claimed. Last week, Union Home Minister Shah, while addressing a public meeting in Jharkhand, had said Prime Minister Modi showed Pakistan its place by abrogating Articles 370 and 35A, and established that J&K is an integral part of India. Earlier, Modi, while speaking in Ranchi, had also referred to the government's step of creating the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, while abrogating Article 370 provisions. Asked whether an opposition grand alliance will be firmed up for the assembly polls, Soren said his party's sole aim is to free Jharkhand's 3.5 crore people from the ""insensitive"" BJP government. ""For this purpose, we are willing to coordinate with all like minded parties to collectively fight the BJP and its divisive policies. JMM was instrumental in the fight to achieve Jharkhand as a separate state, and if necessary, will again engage in the struggle to ensure Jharkhand shines bright on the nation's map,"" he said ""The entire Opposition has already had a meeting and once I get over with the ongoing 'Badlav Yatra', I will sit again with all party leaders,"" the 44-year-old son of JMM chief Shibu Soren said. JMM, Congress, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) and Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested the Lok Sabha polls in alliance earlier this year, but managed to win just two out of the 14 seats. Referring to the understanding of JMM fighting the general elections under the Congress leadership and vice-versa for state polls, Soren said the contours of the alliance for both Lok Sabha and the upcoming Assembly elections were mutually decided by the senior most leadership of both parties. ""So, the Congress leadership including its state leadership in Jharkhand should be cognizant about this commitment especially when they make public statements or remarks to the media. I do expect a lot more responsibility from them in this regard,"" he said. ""We have always been true to our commitments and would reiterate again that we are ready to fight the BJP together,"" he said. Asked if the delay in firming up a grand alliance was giving BJP the upper hand, Soren asserted that it was the saffron party that was on the backfoot in Jharkhand. The BJP looks to seal an alliance with whoever they can when faced with precarious circumstances, he claimed. ""Their alliances in Bihar, Jharkhand and Maharashtra in Lok Sabha are recent examples. They know that without that it's difficult to steer through,"" Soren said. He said conversations are ongoing to firm up the opposition alliance and there was still time to finalise its shape. Soren, who has been touring the state as part of his 'Badlav Yatra' and connecting with the masses, claimed there was a lot of anger among the people of the state as the Raghubar Das government had failed to meet their aspirations. ""Farmers and farm labourers have committed suicide, families have been destroyed, anganwadi workers are on an indefinite fast, para teachers were on a statewide strike and the police brutally lathi charged them as if they were deadly criminals, youth not getting jobs are ending their lives and the state government is giving government jobs to people from outside Jharkhand,"" he alleged. ""A people's alliance is ready to teach them (BJP) a lesson. JMM is just trying to give shape and voice to this collective anger of people against the BJP,"" he said. He also said ""hunger deaths"" and ""mob lynchings"" had also got a bad name to the state in the last five years. Elections were announced on Saturday for Maharashtra and Haryana assemblies, which means polls in Jharkhand will be held later. The term for the Jharkhand Assembly will end on January 5 and polls are expected to take place by end of this year. The BJP had won 37 of the 81 seats during the 2014 assembly elections and formed government with the help of regional parties. The JMM won 19 and Congress eight seats.

 BJP banking on ‘Mano’ magic in Haryana | India News - Times of India,"What does it tell you about the opposition in Haryana when the only party openly challenging chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to debates on issues like unemployment and farm distress is an assembly polls debutant? And what does it tell you about the ruling party, BJP, when the man who stepped into the CM’s office from the unknown five years ago — a Punjabi and commoner in a state dominated by dynasts and Jat politicians — is not only the poster boy of its reelection campaign but also being rebranded ‘Mano’ to play on its likeness to ‘NaMo’? BJP’s confidence springs from its clean sweep of the state’s 10 Lok Sabha seats in the parliamentary elections earlier this year, increasing its vote share from 34% in 2014 to 58%, the vacancies in government jobs it has filled in the state, the spectrum of central schemes from Ujjwala to Ayushman Bharat, and the Modi factor. From 47 seats in the last election, when it came to power in Haryana or the first time, it’s now chasing Mission 75, the target set by Amit Shah. The opposition has, meanwhile, imploded. The split in the Chautala family led to the INLD being decimated in the Lok Sabha election this year. The vote share of the regional powerhouse — the principal opposition party for the last five years as it finished ahead of Congress in the 2014 assembly polls — plummeted to 1.9% from nearly 25% in 2014. With almost no chance of a reconciliation with the breakaway Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), whose face is Om Prakash Chautala’s grandson Dushyant, INLD’s struggle is to remain relevant. And Congress, which has been looking rudderless since the Lok Sabha drubbing, recently negotiated an uneasy truce in the warring state unit by elevating Kumari Selja to the state chief’s post and making former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda its campaign face. The party has been spending more time on keeping its organisation together than challenging BJP on local issues, which will come into play much more than they did in the Lok Sabha polls. “The one and only thing which allows Khattar to stand confident is the total absence of a strong opposition. And this is precisely the reason why we have come up with our election slogan, ‘Nikkammi Sarkar, Vipaksh Bekaar,” says the psephologist, Yogendra Yadav, whose outfit Swaraj India is contesting the state polls for the first time. “The main opposition parties in the state are simply stunned after the Lok Sabha loss, there is a loss of narrative,” he adds. Of that, BJP has plenty. One of its main campaign points will be transparency in government jobs and the 69,000 appointments the government says it has made in the last five years, with 20,000 more in the process. The abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir, meanwhile, will bolster its nationalist and strong leadership narrative. Khattar himself has come a long way, from surviving the backlash he received during 2016 Jat quota agitation when the party leadership had almost made up its mind to remove him from the CM’s post for poorly handling the crisis to leading the statewide Jan Ashirwad rally as BJP’s Haryana face. Analysts say the CM is comfortable in BJP now and BJP is comfortable with Khattar, who is only the fourth CM of Haryana not from the Jat community. “This is helped by the fact that we are witnessing a total decline of INLD, a party which dominated the political scene of Haryana for a long time. Khattar comes across as a credible face for non-Jats after Bhajan Lal. The other reason for BJP and Khattar looking good is the influx of leaders from various opposition parties. Besides, national issues have always influenced Haryana elections and, this time around, Article 370 will be used by BJP to woo voters,” says Dr Kushal Pal, associate professor and HoD, political science, at Dayal Singh College, Karnal. Jat leaders are disappointed with Khattar but livid with INLD. “By splitting, both INLD and JJP have backstabbed the Jat community and not left us with any option. The move by Congress to make Hooda leader of the CLP is belated and unlikely to sway Jat voters towards Congress much,” said a Jat leader who was at the forefront of the 2016 Jat agitation. Selja doesn’t agree. She says Congress will give BJP a tough fight. “I totally disagree with the view that there is no one against BJP. I agree we have lost an election, but it does not mean we are nowhere in the picture. Congress is the only opposition to BJP,” says Selja. Another senior Congress leader believes BJP’s “arrogance” will cost it votes. “BJP and its leadership have become very arrogant despite not having done anything substantial in the last five years in the state. The voters will not want to give the party a second chance,” the leader says. JJP, which is contesting its first state election, is targeting the INLD vote bank by staking claim as the bearer of Devi Lal’s legacy. It has the resources and the cadre but is still work in progress organisationally. AAP is in the fray, too, but it remains to be seen in how many seats. “Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal isn’t fully convinced that the party should contest Haryana elections, given the fact that there are hardly four months left for elections to be held in Delhi. There is a feeling that a bad result here could have repercussions in the Capital. However, the state unit is of the view that it will not be taken seriously at all in future if there is absolutely no representation of AAP in Haryana elections,” said a party source. “The state unit has finally managed to convince Kejriwal to allow it to contest on at least few seats if not on all 90 seats.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

"Maharashtra, Haryana Elections 2019: Over to Sonia Gandhi again as Congress faces do or die battle | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The challenging battles of Maharashtra and Haryana, to be followed by Jharkhand, mark an existential crisis for Congress. Close on the heels of a wipeout in Lok Sabha polls, a negative outcome in state polls would further deepen the despair among Congress workers. A Manifesto for Mumbai begins to take shapeThrust into leadership position yet again at this critical moment, ironically by her own son Rahul Gandhi’s resignation, Sonia Gandhi realises it is an emergency. She did manage to turn it around for Congress when she first took the political plunge during the saffron wave of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but 2019 may prove very different. The state polls come at a time when Congress and the country are overwhelmed by the victory of Narendra Modi-led BJP in Lok Sabha polls, that is dictating the popular sentiment. Cong’s 2 enemies: BJP’s momentum, its inertiaHowever, Congress had not done itself any favour with a protracted period of inertia in the two poll-bound states, or with the leadership crisis post-LS polls which has only exacerbated the sense of desolation within. Sonia’s surprise return, owing to the party’s failure to find a replacement to Rahul Gandhi, has managed to infuse some action. The rejig in Haryana unit has helped paper over the dissent emanating from the Hooda household. Maharashtra unit too has accelerated activities. To checkmate Shiv Sena, BJP keen to win most Mumbai seatsBut this minor momentum, badly delayed, is up against the big picture that is disheartening for Congress cadres. The Modi-dominated polarised polity and the debate on nationalism triggered by the abrogation of Article 370, coupled with corruption cases against big Congress leaders, appears to be weighing heavily on the Congress bid to pit economic slowdown as the principal poll plank against the BJP. While slowdown is a reality as is the issue of jobs, the political pitch of the saffron communication machine appears to be carrying the day. Many Congressmen drove home the handicap during a recent brainstorming between the AICC and the state units. Maharashtra assembly elections: Opposition marginalised, BJP eyes bigger marginWhat more can the ageing matriarch do in these trying times? Congress managers are reconciled to a bad performance in state polls, which include Jharkhand and Delhi to follow.

 Modi-Shah to again be BJP’s Jodi No. 1 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent rally in Nasik on the conclusion of “Maha Janadesh Yatra” was seen as the virtual launch of BJP’s campaign for the assembly polls in the state after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis completed a 4000km campaign trail starting from Amravati to Nasik. BJP president and home minister Amit Shah will be in Mumbai on Sunday to address a seminar on Modi government’s historic decision of nullifying Article 370 that withdrew special status to Jammu and Kashmir. A Manifesto for Mumbai begins to take shapeBoth Modi and Shah who have emerged the main draw for BJP are set to lead the campaign. While the PM will obviously be the spearhead, Shah, basking in the glow of nullification of Article 370, is going to tour the two states far more extensively. Besides scrapping of Article 370, the Centre’s other achievements like ban on triple talaq besides the latest mega booster for the economy through historic reduction of corporate tax are likely to be the main campaign theme. They are also likely to drive home the advantage of a “double engine” government - both at the Centre and in the state. To checkmate Shiv Sena, BJP keen to win most Mumbai seatsVictory of BJP in the recent Lok Sabha polls was attributed largely to Modi magic of not only assertive leadership but delivering the welfare schemes directly, impacting major chunk of the populace. The legislations on Kashmir have given more boost to the image of Prime Minister Modi and also Shah as assertive leaders, making them campaign spearheads once again. Maharashtra assembly elections: Opposition marginalised, BJP eyes bigger marginThough riding on Modi’s aura, BJP will be focussed on the local issues in Maharashtra or Haryana where defections have weakened rivals while the saffron camp faces no leadership crisis in the two states with chief ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal Khattar firmly placed. Fadnavis has already created history of sorts by completing full five-year term, becoming only the second Maharashtra CM to do so after Congress’s Vasant Rao Naik (1963-75). Khattar on the other hand had a shaky beginning as he had to face wrath during the Jat quota stir, but managed the perception battle well with a clean image and corruption-free performance.

According to the statement, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind General Secretary Mehmood Madani told Shah that they might have differences with the government on several issues but they are with it on all matters of national interest. Shah assured the delegation that there will be no impact on Kashmiri culture because of the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, the statement said.

"Maharashtra election 2019: BJP looks to improve tally; Sena, oppn for political space | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: Apart from testing the fortunes of ruling BJP and incumbent chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, the next month's assembly polls in Maharashtra pose a tough challenge to the Opposition bloc, especially to NCP chief Sharad Pawar, beset with defections to the ruling camp. The Election Commission of India on Saturday announced a single-phase poll for Maharashtra which will be held on October 21. Counting of votes will be taken up on October 24. This will also be the first assembly election under the Narendra Modi government and also first after the April- May Lok Sabha polls, which handed a massive mandate to the Narendra Modi government. The BJP, led by Fadnavis, is looking to better its 2014 tally of 122 seats in the 288-member House. With the BJP taking centrestage even in Lok Sabha polls contested in 2014 and 2019, the Congress's hold in its strongholds of Vidarbha, Marathwada and Mumbai region has weakened. Similarly, the NCP is struggling to retain its pocket-borough of western Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena has retained its base in Konkan. In a clever strategy, the BJP has been inducting leaders from the NCP and the Congress since the last few months to expand its footprint in the regions where the party lacks organisational base. The BJP's tactic is not only proving to be psychologically advantageous for the saffron party but it is also a signal to the Uddhav Thackeray-led party to be ready to play the second fiddle in the state politics. The BJP and the Sena are locked in a tug-of-war over sharing of the 288 seats. Through his 'Maha Janadesh Yatra', Fadnavis travelled a distance of 4000 kms covering 140 assembly constituencies. The yatra concluded in Nashik on September 19 in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. For Sharad Pawar, it could be the toughest battle in his political career spanning over five decades. It was evident from speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and earlier of BJP chief Amit Shah that the BJP has been strategically attacking Pawar. Apart from raising issues like farm loan waiver and development, indications are that the BJP would milk the withdrawal of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 to push its nationalist agenda. On the other hand, the Congress and the NCP are targetting the government on agrarian distress, drought, the economic ""slowdown"" and ""joblessness"". In 2014 polls, both the Sena-BJP and the NCP-Congress alliances ruptured ahead of elections. After the four-way contest, the BJP emerged as the single largest party, followed by the Sena (63), Congress (42) and the NCP (41). The Sena later joined the government but with a bruised ego. While the BJP and the Sena are yet to arrive at a consensus on the seat-sharing formula, the Congress and the NCP have already sealed the deal to contest 125 seats each. The Opposition bloc will leave 38 seats for smaller allies. As far as the Congress is concerned, the party appears rudderless in the state which once used to be its stronghold. Many leaders of the party, including former Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and former minister Harshvardhan Patil, have joined the BJP. While sitting MLAs Nirmala Gavit, Bhausaheb Kambale and Abdul Sattar have joined the Shiv Sena, MLAs Kalidas Kolambkar and Jaykumar Gore have crossed over to the BJP. Former Mumbai Congress president Kripashankar Singh, a north Indian leader who wields clout in some pockets, has also quit the party. Though he has not opened his cards on his future political move, speculation is that he might join the BJP. Bahujan Vikas Agadhi (BVA) MLA Vilas Tare has joined the Sena. Prominent defectors from the NCP who have switched loyalties to the BJP are former minister and Navi Mumbai strongman Ganesh Naik, who was with Pawar for at least two decades, and Udayanraje Bhosale, a direct descendant of warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Bhosale had resigned from his Parliamentary membership from Satara in western Maharashtra before joining the BJP in Delhi in the presence of party chief and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Those from the NCP fold who have switched their allegiance to the BJP are MLAs Sandeep Naik, Vaibhav Pichad, and Rana Jagjitsinh. Former party MPs Dhananjay Mahadik and Sanjeev Naik have also joined the BJP. Leaders from Pawar's party who have joined the Sena are sitting MLAs Pandurang Barora, Shivendraraje Bhosale, Avdhoot Tatkare and his father and former MLC Anil Tatkare, Dilip Sopal and former state unit president Bhaskar Jadhav. Former NCP MLAs Sachin Ahir and Madhukar Pichad, who had served as ministers in the erstwhile Democratic Front (DF) government in the state, have also joined the Sena. Both of them were considered close to Pawar. According to a senior Congress leader, the deserters have switched sides considering local political equations, but they are not being able to dent the party's organisation at the local level. The Congress and the NCP had been in power for three consecutive terms before they lost to the BJP in 2014. Though the previous governments were headed by the Congress, it was the NCP which represented plum portfolios. In contrast, incumbent CM Fadnavis is firm in saddle. He is only the second chief minister, and first non-Congress one, to complete the full five-year term in office. Congress' Vasantrao Naik had held the post of chief minister for eleven long years. The Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), comprising the AIMIM, adds another dimention to the fragmented politics of the state, which has sizable Dalit and Muslim pockets. In the Lok Sabha polls, the VBA had played spoilsport for the candidates of the Congress and the NCP by causing division of votes, which ultimately benefitted the NDA. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) of Raj Thackeray, which is battling for political survival, has also vowed to contest. In Lok Sabha polls, the MNS had extended its support to the Opposition bloc.

BJP playing Kashmir card to hide failures: Pratap Singh Khachariyawas | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas has alleged that BJP was using abrogation of special status for Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) to divert attention of people from its failures. Addressing Congress workers, Khachariyawas said the party would fight the local bodies elections with the slogan of “Make Jaipur Number One by Voting for Congress”. He said the Centre’s policies had been playing havoc with the economy and all sections of people were suffering due to wrong policies resulting in economic slowdown and unemployment. Khachariyawas said it was Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who made Kashmir an integral part of India by inserting Article 371. Article 370 was a temporary provision to reassure the Kashmiris during the time of merger. The then ruler of Kashmir, Raja Hari Singh, was adamant of neither merging Kashmir with India nor Pakistan but an independent nation. When Pakistan unleashed an attack on Kashmir, Singh’s army faced defeat. He took the help of India on the advice of Sheikh Abdulla. Nehru promptly extended help and repulsed Pakistani attack. Otherwise, Kashmir would have been part of Pakistan now, he said. After that Singh expressed his willingness to be part of India but with certain conditions. Khachariyawas said, “Nehru made it sure with Article 371 that Kashmir remained an integral part of India. He accepted the demand of Kashmir maintaining its unique identity under Article 370 only as a temporary provision,” Khachariyawas asserted. He alleged that BJP was trying to make Kashmir an issue in the local body elections as the Modi government’s 100 days in power had turned out to be a failure. The Congress would seek vote on its government’s performance. The Congress will try to win the local bodies and panchayats elections so that all elected bodies would function in tandem with the government,” he said.

" Jaishankar holds talks on terrorism, regional issues with top Finnish leadership | India News - Times of India","HELSINKI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has held long discussions on cross-border terrorism with the top Finnish leadership, amidst Pakistan's bid to internationalise the Kashmir issue after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status. Jaishankar, who is on a three-day visit to Finland, the current chair of the European Union that supported India on the Kashmir issue, on Friday held talks with Prime Minister Antti Rinne and his Finnish counterpart Pekka Haavisto on a broad spectrum of bilateral relations. Jaishankar and Haavisto had ""long discussion"" on terrorism and the two leaders reviewed bilateral relationship with special focus on green technologies, the external affairs minister tweeted on Friday. They also exchanged notes on regional issues. During a special debate of the plenary of the European Parliament on the situation in Kashmir on Tuesday, European parliamentarians Ryszard Czarnecki and Fulvio Martusciello slammed Pakistan for harbouring militants. Czarnecki, the member of EU Parliament and European Conservatives and Reformists Group in Poland called India the ""greatest democracy of the world"" and said terrorists who carried out attacks in India did not come from the Moon. Later, delivering a speech on 'India and the World - Priorities of Indian Foreign Policy' at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs (FIIA) on Friday, Jaishankar said that India's decision to revoke Jammu and Kashmir's special status has a ""national security connotation,"" emphasising that the ""epicentre of global terrorism"" is right there in the country's ""neighbourhood"". India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5. Reacting to the move, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". New Delhi has also asked Islamabad to accept the reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric. ""In an apparent reference to Pakistan, Jaishankar said, ""India lives in a tough neighbourhood and faces more than its fair share of national security challenges. Most prominent among them is the cross-border terrorism that we have been subjected to for many decades."" He said cross-border terrorism has cost more than 40,000 lives in the last three decades. Jaishankar said India is opposed to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and believe there is no justification for it, whatsoever. ""But it is not just enough to have a position. When subjected to terrorist attacks, any polity that is sincerely committed to the welfare of its people will surely respond. And indeed, that is precisely what we have done in recent years,"" he said. ""Even the changes that were approved last month by the Indian Parliament in respect of Jammu and Kashmir, while driven by the needs of governance and development, have a national security connotation,"" Jaishankar said. Jaishankar said, ""We know that the epicentre of global terrorism is there right in our neighbourhood. But even as we take our responsive measures, our belief is that this is not just a concern for one country but for the entire international community."" ""Sadly, past neglect has come to haunt many distant regions of the world. It is, therefore, vital that various aspects of this challenge - including radicalisation, financing and state-sponsorship - are addressed by all of us together. Only then will we make progress,"" he said. Jaishankar said in the Indian sub-continent, significant changes are taking place as India determinedly pursue a 'Neighbourhood First' policy. ""This envisages a generous and non-reciprocal effort at building connectivity, contacts and commerce in a seriously under-regionalised geography,"" he said. To India's West, he said, ""the future of Afghanistan is the big concern, as are the choices of Pakistan in becoming a normal neighbour."" Speaking on the Gulf situation, Jaishankar said the issue has greater anxiety for India than for Europe, ""given our stakes in energy, diaspora, trade and security"". In an apparent reference to China, Jaishankar said there are multiple versions of an approach to the Indo-Pacific and harmonising them would be an interesting diplomatic exercise. China has been trying to expand its military presence in the Indo-Pacific, a biogeographic region comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea. China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the sea. Addressing the audience, Jaishankar said India's foreign policy ""has strong developmental focus now as we explore sourcing technology, best practices, capital, resources and collaborations with global partners."" Jaishankar noted that over 100 Finnish companies, including Wartsila and Nokia, are present in India. As the world moves towards a more knowledge-based economy, the natural strengths of the two economies could complement each other, he said. Earlier, Jaishankar visited the Parliament of Finland held talks with first deputy speaker Tuula Haatainen. He also met the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Finnish Parliament.

Amit Shah in Mumbai on Sunday to speak on Article 370 | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Union home minister and BJP chief Amit Shah will deliver a lecture on Article 370 at NSE Grounds, Goregaon, on Sunday morning. The abrogation of Jammu & Kashmir's special status with the defanging of Article 370 is the BJP's main election plank for the Maharashtra assembly election. Nationalism will be ""the theme"" for the state polls, reiterated BJP sources. This has raised questions on why a national issue should become a subject for state elections when there are several local issues that need to be addressed. Shah, who was in Solapur for the chief minister's Maha Janadesh Yatra early this month, focused entirely on the Article 370 issue in his address there, rhetorically asking the audience if the Centre's decision was right or not. In Nashik on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the decision to defang Article 370 was a decision for India's unity. He roundly slammed ""some leaders"" for ""speaking the language of Pakistan"". Lashing out at Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar for not supporting the government on Article 370, Modi said, ""He (Pawar) likes the neighbouring country. It seems he finds them better than us, but the world knows where the terror factories lie."" On why J&K should be a local issue, BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said that in 1995, the then Sena-BJP government in Maharashtra was the first to provide 1% reservation in medical and engineering seats for Kashmiri students.

" If Pak stoops low at UN, we will soar high, says India’s UN envoy | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: While India has said that terrorism is going to be just one of the several issues on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda at the UN General Assembly, the government is likely to come back hard at Pakistan on the same issue if the latter indeed raises Kashmir-related developments there.

""What you're telling me is that it will be more of the same, much more of the same from the side of one country. If that is so what is our response? So let me put it this way.

NIA gets Tarn Taran blast probe | Amritsar News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: The Centre has accepted Punjab government's recommendation to hand over probe into the September 5 Tarn Taran blast case to National Investigation Agency (NIA). Punjab chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh and DGP Dinkar Gupta on Friday received confirmation in this regard. The state had recommended handing over of the investigation to NIA in view of its national and international ramifications and suspected links of the accused with the Pakistan-backed Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Two persons were killed and one injured in the blast, which occurred when the trio was digging a pit to retrieve a dumped explosive consignment in a vacant plot on the outskirts of Pandori Gola village in Tarn Taran. The district police had registered an FIR under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC and various sections of the Explosive Substances Act. The state police had arrested eight members of the Pakistan-backed module, whose interrogations led to a disclosure of conspiracy and attacks by the group, including an aborted attack on ""high value target"" in 2016. According to the state police, seven others, including the module leader and main conspirator Bikramjit Singh alias Granthi (believed to be in Austria), are still absconding. The investigation had revealed Bikramjit, a follower of Damdami Taksal, used to work as a pathi. Police had said Bikramjit was a highly radicalized individual who planned to target high political dignitaries, socio-religious places, local politicians, Hindu leaders and Sikh preachers, with the help of locally made crude bombs. An IED expert said he had also planned to attack police personnel with bombs. Other absconders have been identified as Gurpreet Singh based in California, Gurwinder Singh alias Prince based in Sanjose in California, Sodhi Singh residing in Armenia; Arwinder Singh alias Honey, Kuldeep Singh and Ranjit Singh alias Bablu, who escaped to the US a day after the attack on a liquor shop in Amritsar on May 3, 2016. The police have so far apprehended Harjit Singh, Manpreet Singh Mann, Chandeep Singh Khalsa alias Gabbar Singh, Malkiat Singh alias Sher Singh alias Shera, Maandeep Singh alias Massa Singh, Amritpal Singh alias Amrit, Amarjit Singh alias Amar and Gurjant Singh (under treatment in hospital). The state police probe had revealed strong links of the module members with Pakistan and SFJ. Police had said Chandeep Singh was found to be in regular touch with Pakistan-based Usman who had earlier contacted Gabbar Singh on Facebook in 2018. Usman used to send Chandeep WhatsApp messages on Khalistan and also on Article 370 move by the Indian government. Usman used to motivate Gabbar Singh to work for the establishment of a separate state of Khalistan and unite with Kashmiri Jehadis. Several Pakistani numbers were also found in Chandeep's contact list, police had said. Punjab police investigation had revealed that Bikramjit used to source material for his explosives from near Haqima gate and Lohgarh in the old city area in Amritsar. He had successfully radicalized most of the module members at a religious place during the Ghallughara week in June 2016. He had also imparted training in IED manufacturing to radicalized module members at his home at Panjwar village and in the house of Gurjant Singh at Bachere village (Tarn Taran). After radicalizing, motivating, imparting training, sourcing low grade explosives and supplying IEDs to important module members and other individuals, he had escaped to Austria via Armenia in July 2018. The module had planned to target a dera in Tarn Taran district on the orders of Sodhi Singh Khalsa of Armenia, who was one of the module's main links to the SFJ.

" ‘3,100 of 4,000 detained in J&amp;K since Aug 5 released’ | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Countering terror threats issued through oral warnings, posters and attacks to deter people in Kashmir from resuming normal life and business, the Jammu & Kashmir police is acting swiftly to identify the perpetrators and initiate strong legal action to put them out of circulation. J&K DGP Dilbag Singh said that over the past few days, as many as 30 persons who were allegedly threatening people not to open shops or market apple produce, have been picked up cross the Valley. “J&K police is watching activities of those terrorising locals from resuming normal lives, identifying the perpetrators and moving swiftly to arrest them. Around 30 arrests have been made from places like Srinagar, Ganderbal, Sopore, Shopian, Pulwama. We are taking strong legal action against these scare-mongers, including under Public Safety Act (PSA),” Singh said in an exclusive conversation with TOI. Only on Wednesday, an incident of a militant threatening people in Srinagar had come to light. The person was immediately identified and picked up. Similar threatening acts in Ganderbal were watched by the local police over 2-4 days, the persons identified and detained by the police. All of them face action under stringent laws. As per sources, around 4,000 persons have been detained since the government moved to abrogate Article 370 on August 5, but nearly 3,100 have been released since, some within hours or days. While a majority were detained under Section 107 of CrPC, 230-250 persons are held under PSA. Most of the PSA detainees have been shifted to jails outside J&K. The move to swiftly zero in on those threatening locals, the police chief confirmed, will help instil a sense of confidence that threats are being effectively nipped so that people can get on with their daily normal activities without fear. “There is now a 100% relaxation in curbs (barring the mobile/internet shutdown) in the Valley. The situation is absolutely normal barring in a few sensitive areas including part of Srinagar downtown. For instance, there were zero incidents of violence recorded on Thursday. Even on a normal day in the Valley (prior to abrogation of J&K’s special status), there was never a day without some incident or the other. In 2016, during the protests against killing of Burhan Wani, scores of violent incidents were recorded in a single day,” Singh pointed out. In a majority of CrPC detention cases, youths found indulging in stone-pelting or minor incidents were picked up under Section 107 and counselled along with their families or community elders from the area. They were subsequently released on bond with the involvement of the communities ensuring that they are under moral pressure not to repeat the offence. “In most cases, no repeat offence has been reported,” said the J&K police chief. Singh said that former chief minister Farooq Abdullah was the only political leader to be detained under PSA after August 5, with most other politicians detained under Section 107 of CrPC. “He was detained under PSA not for his acts but due to potential danger to public order from his statements and utterances. The period of his detention will be decided by the PSA advisory board,” he stated. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" Doles being handed to corporates at expense of farmers, claim Left parties | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Left parties on Friday slammed the BJP government for the “deepening crisis” in the Indian economy and said concessions and doles were being handed out to corporates at the expense of farmers. Referring to the government’s decision as a “definite fascist trend” in the country, CPM chief Sitaram Yechury said Modi government provided relief of over Rs 2.25 lakh crore to the rich in India but shied away from helping farmers forced to commit suicide due to farm distress. The Left convention, attended by all Left parties including CPM, CPI, All India Forward Bloc and Revolutionary Socialist Party, also announced that they will hold nationwide protests against the government from October 10 to 16. “Unemployment is at its highest level in 50 years. Industries and businesses are ruined and people are suffering job losses,” Yechury claimed. CPI general secretary D Raja stressed the need to save the working class people and deprived sections of the society. “The Indian economy is in shambles. Instead of retrieving it, the RSS-BJP combine have plunged the country in a political-social crisis,” Raja said, referring to the government’s decision to scrap Article 370, impose NRC in Assam and the rise in instances of mob lynchings.. A joint statement from the five Left parties also said the protests were being held to demand from the government that public investment be increased to generate employment, an unemployment allowance be given to youth and monthly minimum wage be fixed at Rs 18,000.

 Report by chief justice of J&amp;K HC doesn't support claim that people unable to access court: SC | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The claim that people in the Kashmir valley are unable to access the Jammu and Kashmir high court has not been supported by a report received from the chief justice there, the Supreme Court said on Friday. The apex court however directed the Juvenile Justice Committee of the high court to undertake an exercise on alleged detention of children in Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370 and submit a report within a week. ""We have received a report from the chief justice (of Jammu and Kashmir high court) which does not support your statement,"" a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi told senior lawyer Huzefa Ahmadi, who had on September 16 told the top court that people in valley were finding it difficult to approach the high court there. The bench, also comprising Justices S A Bobde and S A Nazeer, said it too has received some ""conflicting reports"" on the issue but does not intend to comment on the report received from the Chief Hustice of the high court. Ahmadi, while representing child rights activists Enakshi Ganguly and Shanta Sinha, had said in the top court that people in Kashmir were finding it difficult to approach the high court there. The submission was made when the top court was hearing a petition alleging detention of children in Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370. Taking note of Ahmadi's submission, the top court had sought a report from the Chief Justice on the issue. During the hearing on Friday, the bench agreed to examine the plea filed by Ganguly and Sinha while observing that it has raised substantial issue pertaining to alleged detention of children. ""We have perused the report sent to us by the Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir high court pursuant to our order dated September 16, 2019. At this stage, we do not consider it appropriate to offer any comments on the said report,"" the bench noted in its order. ""As the issues highlighted pertain to alleged detention of children, we direct the Juvenile Justice Committee of the high court of Jammu and Kashmir to undertake an exercise with regard to the facts stated in the writ petition and revert to us within a week from today,"" it said. The top court, which said that its Registry would send a copy of the petition to the committee ""forthwith"", has posted the matter for hearing after a week. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Jammu and Kashmir administration, told the court that when the authorities found that one of the detenu was a juvenile, his matter was immediately referred to the juvenile justice board. ""It (petition) raises substantial issues which are beyond any individual,"" the bench told Mehta. The top court had on September 16 termed as ""very very serious"" the claim that people are finding it difficult to approach the Jammu and Kashmir high court and asked the Chief Justice there to ""forthwith"" submit a report in this regard. The CJI had then said that he would himself visit Srinagar, if required, and he would also speak to the Chief Justice of high court about this. The apex court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking its intervention on the issue of alleged detention of children in Kashmir. Mehta had earlier told the bench that all the courts in the state are functioning and even the Lok Adalats have been conducted there. The plea has contended that all persons below the age of 18 years who have been detained be identified through an age census. Seeking directions that illegally detained children be produced before the Juvenile Justice Committee of the high court, the plea has also sought compensation from them.

 Fresh restrictions in Kashmir Valley in view of Friday prayers | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Fresh restrictions were imposed in parts of Kashmir on Friday as a precautionary measure to maintain law and order in view of congregational prayers, officials said. Normal life continued to remain affected across the valley for the 47th consecutive day with markets closed and public transport off the roads, the officials said. Restrictions under Section 144 CrPc have been imposed in few areas of the valley to maintain law and order, the officials said. They said the curbs have been imposed in Nowhatta and adjoining areas in downtown (interior city) and Anchar area of Soura police station in Srinagar. The restrictions have also been imposed in Kupwara and Handwara police districts and the main towns of Ganderbal, Anantnag and Bijbehara, the officials added. Security forces have been deployed in strength in vulnerable areas in the rest of the valley, they said. The officials said the curbs were a precautionary measure to maintain law and order in view of apprehensions that vested interests might exploit the large Friday prayer gatherings at big mosques and shrines to fuel protests. Friday prayers have not been allowed at any of the major mosques or shrines â€"" including Jamia Masjid in Nowhatta or Dargah Sharief in Hazratbal - in the valley for the past over a month now. Restrictions were first imposed across Kashmir on August 5 when the Centre announced its decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcate the state into two Union territories. The restrictions were lifted in phases from many parts of the valley. Internet services have remained suspended across all platforms, they said. While landlines across the valley were functional, voice calls on mobile devices were working only in Kupwara and Handwara police districts of north Kashmir, they added. The efforts of the state government to open schools have not borne fruit as parents continued to keep children at home due toÂ apprehensions about their safety. Most of the top-level and second rung mainstream politicians, including three former chief ministers â€"" Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, continued to be in detention or under house arrest. While NC president Farooq Abdullah was first placed under house arrest, he was on Tuesday booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA). His son Omar and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti were detained on the night of August 4 -- hours before the Centre announced its decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and to bifurcate the state into two Union territories. Most of the mainstream leaders, including former ministers and legislators, were also either detained or kept under house arrest, the officials said.
