Ashok Gehlot's exclusive interview with TOI | Jaipur News - Times of India,"On January 25, Rajasthan became the third state in the country to pass a resolution in its assembly against the implementation of the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens. It also became the first state in the country to officially declare its non-cooperation towards the impending National Population Register.Hours after the historic special session of the assembly, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot spoke to Swati Mathur about why the CAA-NRC-NPR combine is dangerous, how focus must shift to the state of economy and creating jobs, and the reason he believes Rahul Gandhi can lead the Congress in raising issues that matter:Congress seems to be shifting focus from CAA-NRC-NPR to the issues of economy and unemployment. Why?Congress’s stand on CAA is the same that it was earlier. BJP said it will approach three crore people through door-to-door campaigns to explain the CAA. Why has the need arisen? Until today, no laws made by Parliament needed to be explained. It proves there is a major flaw in the law and now that people have seen through it, they are worried and are having to explain. The real issues — the ones that matter to the people — are related to economy. If the government does not take immediate remedial action, the downward spiral can trigger a massive crisis. Joblessness is on the rise. Youth is frustrated and is getting pushed to the brink. Industry is stressed and small and medium trades are shutting shop. Where will the jobs come from? For an economy to grow, there needs to be investment in public and private sectors, there should be purchasing power in the hands of the common people and exports should rise. This, not CAA, should be the government’s top priority. Instead, since BJP came to power in 2014, they have taken decisions to hurt the economy. Auto sector is closing showrooms, petrol, diesel prices are not reducing, prices are rising and farmers, labourers and youth are all frustrated. The GST regime even cost Rajasthan a revenue loss of over Rs 11,000 crore. After winning in 2019, the BJP has returned with inflated egos. It doesn’t care about public sentiment. The government abrogated Article 370 and settled the Ram Mandir issue. People welcomed that because it brought closure to a long-standing dispute. But they are continuing to rake up one thing after another to fulfil their Hindu Rashtra agenda. It is a dangerous game. I even wonder whether all of BJP stands with them (PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah) on this. Because they don’t involve people in making decisions. What is today’s Yuva Aakrosh Rally seeking to achieve?It is a campaign Rahul Gandhi is starting from Rajasthan, where we will tell the youth that we stand with them, shoulder to shoulder. In democracy, it is very important to hear the Opposition’s view. It gives confidence to people. The youth has little faith left in the government of the day. If they feel that the opposition is also not standing with them, they will feel even more frustrated. In public interest, and to tell the youth that we stand with them to pressurise the government into listening to the voice of the people, Rahul ji will lead this rally. We will force the government to listen and to concede. heeded the call of the Congress Working Committee — the highest decision making body of the party — and the sentiments of its members to lead us strongly on various issues. He is an assertive leader and does issue-based politics. He is not waylaid by the government’s efforts to sentimentalise issues. I am glad he chose Rajasthan to start this campaign from. Congress leaders have said states are bound by the Constitution to implement laws passed by Parliament. In this light, since Rajasthan is now the third state to pass a resolution against CAA and NRC, and the first to formally announce its non-cooperation towards NPR, how will you do this?If there is a democratically elected NDA government at the Centre, there are elected governments in states too. A majority of states are saying CAANRC should not be implemented because it is impractical. Take Assam for instance. People went into depression, some committed suicide, many spent hard earned money to bribe officials so their names would be included in NRC. Despite this, they are facing disenfranchisement. The entire exercise cost Rs 1,600 crore and now (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah says it will be implemented across the country. According to estimates, a nationwide NRC will cost Rs 64,000 crore. Can the country afford this? What will happen if it is conducted? Results will be the same as they were in Assam. Of the 19 lakh people left out in Assam, 16 lakh turned out to be Hindus. Yet, they (BJP) created such a ruckus. To prevent a recurrence of Assam, all states have given a call to the Centre not to implement the law. Public doesn’t want it and the majority of elected state government don’t want it. They (NDA government) should accept the public sentiment and withdraw the law. Such a decision will be welcomed by the people. CAA, NRC and NPR must not be seen in isolation but as a package. The entire exercise is not practical. If people decide not to show their papers, how many will the government act against? Assam was a small state and they could extract information through fear and force. But can this be done across India? The problem began after the government said it wanted to conduct a nationwide NRC. Now they are on the defensive and have swung into damage-control mode. The PM said that no Hindu or Muslim will face problems. He even said there is no discussion on NRC in the government, and accused the Opposition of inciting people. On the other hand, Shah said it will be done. Between the PM and the HM, who should the public believe? Both have spoken publicly. The PM should explain this. Ultimately, they should remove confusion, win people’s trust and then decide the course of action. If their decision is in public interest, everyone in the country will support them. Protests over CAA-NRC-NPR have taken a violent turn in several states. Rajasthan saw protests too but they were peaceful. What did you do to achieve that?That depends on the call you give to people. Our call to the public in Rajasthan was for a Peace March. We asked for two things; that the Indian Flag must not be allowed to be defaced and that there should be no violence. Lakhs of people participated and held placards as a mark of protest. If Yogi Adityanath had given the same call for a Peace March in UP, told people there should be no violence and had engaged with them and assured them it was their right to stage sit-ins and protest and that the police would facilitate their peaceful protests, there would be no problem. Instead, he used the language of “badla (revenge)” and told protestors they will be taught a lesson. He ended up inciting people further. In democracy, it depends on the chief ministers and the prime minister as to what call they give to their people. The administrative machinery and the police speaks the language that the CM speaks. The administration understands the intent of the political leadership and acts accordingly. That is what happened in UP. Opposition parties have come together to protest against CAA-NRCNPR. BSP, though, has kept away from Congress-led protests ostensibly because Mayawati is upset over her MLAs being poached in Rajasthan. Your comments. I have not poached MLAs. Their entire party merged with the Congress. The Constitution makes it legal for three-fourth or more of a party’s members to merge with another party. Under that law, they merged with Congress. What can I do? This has happened earlier too. She may have other reasons that she is not voicing. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is active on the ground in UP. That may be upsetting Mayawati ji. There are talks of differences in the government — between you and deputy CM Sachin Pilot. Is this true?The media plays this up. I don’t pay attention to it. I don’t pay attention to these “differences”. We were together just yesterday. We meet and talk affectionately and we do our work. Differences exist when both sides create an issue or initiate a confrontation. I don’t create issues. So where is the fight? It takes two to fight.

Top government sources told TOI that as many as five potential sites close to highways passing by Ayodhya have been identified and sent to the Union home ministry for clearance. Plots have been identified on the Ayodhya-Faizabad Road, Ayodhya- Basti Road, Ayodhya-Sultanpur Road, Ayodhya-Gorakhour Road, along with one more spot. Supreme Court to take up Ayodhya review petitions: All you need to knowSources said that land has been identified beyond the “panchkosi parikrama” periphery so that devotees are not inconvenienced when Muslim and Hindu festivals are held simultaneously. Sources also said a mosque closer to highway will ensure easy access to Muslims. Most part of the temple town, with a major portion of its population, is situated within the “panchkosi parikrama” route. Sunni Waqf Board yet to decide on land issueOn November 9, the Supreme Court, while handing over the entire disputed land to the Hindu side for construction of Ram Temple, had asked for identification and allocation of five acres of land to the Muslims to build a mosque as a compensation for the Babri Masjid which had been demolished on December 2, 1992. Sunni Waqf board won't seek Ayodhya reviewWhile the Sunni Waqf Board is yet to decide on whether to accept the alternative land that the government has to provide, other Muslim parties including Jamiat Ulema I Hind and All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which represents individual Muslim litigants, have openly rejected the offer. On the directions of the Supreme Court, the Centre initiated the process for identification of five acres of land for the mosque and asked the state government to send proposals. The UP government, through the Faizabad district administration, is learnt to have shortlisted five places where five acres of land is available and sent the proposal to the Union Home ministry for finalising and shortlisting one.

"Create harmonious society by ending feeling of high, low in society: Suresh 'Bhaiyyaji' Joshi | Mangaluru News - Times of India","MANGALURU: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary Suresh ‘Bhaiyyaji’ Joshi on Saturday exhorted the central management committee and the board of trustees of Vishwa Hindu Parishad meeting in the city to create a harmonious society by ending the feeling of high and low with in the society. Talk of superiority in terms of birth in Hindu society today is not right because a person is superior based on karma, Joshi averred.

 Vice President recalls Mahatma's 'view' to shut Congress platform | India News - Times of India,"ANAND: Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday invoked Mahatma Gandhi's ""suggestion"" to disband the ""Congress as a platform"" after India attained independence from the British in 1947. Naidu also said everybody celebrated the Supreme Court's unanimous verdict on the Ayodhya dispute, clearing the decks for the construction of a Ram temple. The vice president was speaking as the chief guest to mark the 40th Foundation Day of the Institute of Rural Management, Anand (IRMA) on the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) campus. ""Mahatma Gandhi gave two suggestions after Independence. First, he asked for the closure of the Congress as a platform. I am telling you for your information that the Congress was primarily a movement of people of different ideologies,"" he said. The vice president recalled that people had gathered under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Bal Gangadhar Tilak with the goal to achieve independence. ""They came together and fought for independence. When independence was achieved, that work (struggle) was finished and there was no need for any discussion,"" Naidu said. He said Mahatma Gandhi's ""second suggestion"" to go back to villages is unfortunately forgotten. ""We have (instead) shown our backs to villages,"" he added. The vice president said the Ayodhya verdict was celebrated by people. ""People are happy over a meaningful solution (to the Ayodhya dispute)...because we have put an end to these things behind and moved on. The solution has been welcomed by one and all,"" he said. Delivering a historic verdict on November 9, the top court backed the construction of a Ram temple by a government trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya and ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town. Naidu also recalled the contribution made by Verghese Kurien, who is known as the Father of White Revolution. Kurien had also played a crucial role in finding IRMA and NDDB. ""I salute his memory, foresight, and the initiatives he had taken. And the result is for us to see. The regions where this Amul movement reached are developed and other areas are comparatively less developed. It's not only a beautiful but also a dutiful place. When you combine beauty with duty, it becomes multi (sic). ""It was here that white revolution was conceptualised and implemented. Thanks to the nurturing efforts of Dr Kurien and his team, including dairy farmers, India is today the world's largest producer of milk,"" Naidu said. The vice president also visited the native house of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel- the first Home minister of India- who was born in the nearby village of Karamsad. Naidu also recalled former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's initiative to build rural roads, and said the next phase of the movement to provide clean drinking water and toilets was undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""The government has now decided to construct the third phase of rural roads under which roads (with the length of) 1.2 lakh kms will be constructed and developed. By 2024, every village and villagers will get drinking water,"" he said, adding that more than 8 crore LPG gas connections weremade available under the Ujjawala Yojana. The vice president also highlighted the need for water conservation. ""Water crisis is possible in the coming days. In fact it can be seen even now, but we are not paying much attention to it. Joining rivers, cleaning them, conserving lakes, and reducing, reusing and recycling water is a vital mantra,"" he said. The vice president appealed to people to participate in projects undertaken by the government. ""The country has this mentality that every work will be done by govenrment and we can sit idle. This will not do. Whether it is Clean India Clean Water programme, or 'Beti Padhao, Beti Bacho', 'Fitness India', or Yoga...all these programmes should become people's programmes, with people's participation, and this is vital for their success,"" he said. Naidu hailed the brand Amul as the successful example of people's participation. ""This is a great revolutionary story of India, Gujarat, Anand, and Amul,"" he said. Amul is a cooperative dairy company based at Anand. Formed in 1956, it is a cooperative brand managed by the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd., which today is jointly owned by 3.6 million milk producers in Gujarat. ""Proper training and mentoring is a pre-requisite to turn village farmers into successful entrepreneurs,"" the vice president said while highlighting the importance of institutes like IRMA. ""White Revolution was achieved not by mass production, but production by masses. This helped small and marginal farmers to reap the benefits of the economy of scale,"" he said. ""For the dream of decentralised village industry to materialise, we will need sufficient number of well-trained professionals to manage such industry and institutes,"" he said, adding that the rural economy will be vital for India to become a $5 trillion economy. He also recalled Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise of doubling the income of farmers. ""Our prime minister has given a call to double farmers' income by 2022. If this has to be achieved, we need to adopt a multi-pronged approach. There has to be a renewed approach to agro industries, cold storage, warehousing, food processing, dairies, fisheries, value addition etc,"" he said. The vice president further said technology will open up new business ventures for farmers in rural India by way of digital payment and e-commerce. Commenting on onion price, he said, ""Sometimes low price, tears in the eyes, sometimes high prices, again tears in the eyes,"" he said. Naidu also visited Parikrama exhibition on the NDDB campus showcasing the genesis of NDDB and Operation Flood or White Revolution. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 40 academics &amp; activists move SC for review of Ayodhya verdict | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Forty academicians and activists, including Irfan Habib, Jayati Ghosh, Nandini Sundar and Prabhat Patnaik, have filed a joint petition in the Supreme Court seeking review of its November 9 Ayodhya verdict which gave the Janambhoomi-Babri site for construction of Ram temple and ordered that five acres be allotted to Sunni Waqf Board elsewhere in Ayodhya for construction of a mosque. Justifying their decision to approach court in the matter despite having never been a party in the decades-old legal dispute, they contended that they are aggrieved by the apex court verdict “which has a direct impact on the syncretic culture of the country and its secular fabric envisaged in the Constitution”. The petitioners, known for their consistent Left-leaning stance on diverse issues, agreed that there is no doubt about Ayodhya being the birthplace of Lord Rama, but said there is no conclusive evidence of existence of a temple at the site where Babri mosque was built. “The faith of a community cannot override the faith of another community and practices of two faiths cannot and should not be compared as the expressions of faith can also differ. Interestingly, the belief of the Hindus that Ram was born in Ayodhya is not without doubt (as has been expressed by eminent historians such as Romila Thapar and Irfan Habib). “The existence of Babri Masjid is a fact that has been historically documented, whereas the existence of the Hindu temple on which this mosque was built is merely a belief of the Hindus ... Therefore, by relying on the belief of the existence of a temple, over the evidence of existence of the mosque, this decision has been in violation of constitutional principles of equality and freedom of religion,” the petition said.

 Ayodhya remains calm on Babri anniversary; tight security measures in place | India News - Times of India,"AYODHYA (UP): The 27th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition on Friday remained a low-key affair with both Hindu and Muslim religious leaders downplaying the occasion amid tight security measures, less than a month after the Supreme Court's verdict in the land dispute case. In the early hours of the day, life went on as normal in different parts of the city with schoolchildren and morning walkers taking to streets and businesses opening at their usual time. While right-wing Hindu organisations in the past 'celebrated' the day when a mob had pulled down the mosque on the disputed site in 1992, this year the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has decided against observing 'Shaurya Diwas'.  Muslims offer 'namaaz' prayers at Terhi Bazaar Masjid, near Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya on Friday. (PTI photo)Senior priest of Hanumangarhi temple Raju Das told PTI that the day should now be marked as the 'day of amity'. ""The temple is witnessing a regular flow of devotees. It is a normal day for us and the city. We are observing this day as 'sauhaard diwas' (day of amity). In the evening, earthen lamps will be lit in Hanumangarhi,"" he said. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has said that while the anniversary of the historic mosque's demolition by a mob was a day of mourning for Muslims, it was ""up to individuals"" if they wanted to observe the 'yaum-e-gham' or the 'day of sorrow'. At the Jama Masjid Malik Shah here, children were seen reading the Quran under the guidance of Haji Ismail Ansari, even as a poster with a picture of Babri Masjid hung on a wall. Mohammed Shahzad Raeen, a poultry dealer, said there was no problem among Hindu and Muslim residents of Ayodhya who have been peacefully living for generations. Around 150 Muslims attended Friday prayers at the Terhi Bazaar mosque in the vicinity of the Ramjanmabhoomi police station in the afternoon. In the speech before the prayers, Maulana Shafique Alam said, ""December 6 is a day of mourning for us."" He welcomed the decision of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board to go for a review petition against the Supreme Court's November 9 verdict. The Maulana asked the people to demand their rights and remember 'Khuda' (God). The Terhi Bazaar mosque is almost 200-year-old, Shafique Alam said, adding that 40-50 Muslim families lived in its vicinity. People from different age groups turned up at the mosque to offer prayers amidst tight security. At a primary school in Ranopalli area, classes were held in a regular manner. ""In all there are 74 students in the school. Yesterday, 52 students had turned up. Today, around 30 are present,"" Lal Bahadur Yadav, a teacher, said. When asked if the dip in attendance was due to the anniversary of the Babri demolition, he said, ""Possibly yes, as anxiety is present in some parents over December 6."" In the Rikabganj area, devotional songs were playing at various temples that were visited by devotees as usual. Milk shops, eateries and other businesses in the city were operational. ""It is a normal day for us,"" said 60-year-old Brajesh Kumar, a resident. Police personnel kept an eye on activities to prevent any law and order situation. The security arrangements in the city are similar to that put in place ahead of the Supreme Court's November 9 verdict in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case, a senior police officer said. The officer said that religious organisations had assured the administration that the anniversary would be a low-key affair. ""The security plan for December 6 will be a continuation of the plan we had devised for November 9,"" Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) PV Ramasastry said. District Magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha and Senior Superintendent of Police Ashish Tiwari toured various parts of the city. Anuj Kumar Jha said, ""All parties who had organised programmes on the occasion felt the importance of sending a message of amity. Most of them cancelled their programmes."" He said adequate security personnel were deployed following intelligence inputs that some people might violate Section 144 of the CrPC by holding a congregation. ""Proper monitoring and checking is being done. So far, there is no report of any untoward incident,"" Jha said, adding that there was no restriction on devotees visiting temples in the city. SSP Ashish Tiwari said, ""We have been touring the entire city. Deployment has been done in such a manner that the security apparatus is robust without any problem to the common man. The force is already undertaking foot march and drones are being used to keep an eye on various developments."" He adequate security personnel were deployed to ensure peaceful Friday prayers. Ayodhya SSP Ashish Tiwari said the entire district had been divided into four zones, 10 sectors and 14 sub-sectors from a security perspective. ""As many as 78 sand bag posts have been established with armed policemen posted there. Barriers have been put in place to control traffic. As many as 269 police pickets have been set up in sensitive areas,"" Tiwari said. The SSP said that 305 'troublemakers' had been identified and action was being initiated against them. Apart from this, nine quick response teams have been deployed. ""To combat any emergency situation, five arresting parties have been formed in addition to 10 temporary jails,"" he said, adding that anti-sabotage teams were checking hotels, dharamshalas and other public places.

Congress placed hurdles in way of Ram temple: Yogi Adityanath | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: A day ahead of the 27th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday slammed the Congress for putting road blocks in the path of the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya and for speaking in a language that suited Pakistan. Addressing a rally in Itchagarh assembly seat in poll-bound Jharkhand, Yogi said that if the Congress had not created barriers, the long-standing issue of Ramjanmabhoomi would have been solved years ago. “Jo Ram ka nahi, wo kisi kaam ka nahi (One who is not loyal to Lord Ram is of no use),” Yogi said, amid loud chants of Jai Shri Ram from BJP supporters. Yogi reiterated that it was the strength of democracy and judiciary which ensured that no untoward incident happened after the Supreme Court’s verdict favouring construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Yogi also accused the Congress and other opposition parties of ordering firing on kar sevaks who had turned up in large numbers for Ayodhya from Bihar and Jharkhand. Yogi said the Ram temple movement was close to the heart of the people from the SC/ST community who had come to Ayodhya for kar seva in the early 1990s. “The current generation has not witnessed or participated in any Ram temple movement. The previous generations have borne lot of pains for the issue,” he said. The CM said that the BJP had promised a Ram temple before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “Now, we are on the verge of delivering it,” Yogi said.

 Religious leaders downplay Babri demolition anniversary | India News - Times of India,"AYODHYA: Both Muslim and Hindi religious leaders are talking about downplaying the anniversary of the demolition of the Babri mosque, now that the Supreme Court has pronounced its verdict on the Ayodhya dispute. While the police are taking no chances – an official said the security arrangement in the temple town are similar to those ahead of the SC judgment day – religious organisations have assured that the December 6 anniversary will be low key. While right-wing Hindu organisations earlier ""celebrated"" the day when a mob pulled down the structure on the disputed site, some Muslim groups mourned it. This time, although the AIMPLB said ""a day of sorrow"" would be observed, it added that ""it is up to the individuals"". The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has too decided against observing the 27th anniversary of the demolition as ""Shaurya Diwas"". ""Yaum-e-gham (day of sorrow) will be observed, wherever it was observed last year. And, it is up to individuals to observe it or not,"" senior AIMPLB office-bearer Zafaryab Jilani said. VHP spokesman Sharad Sharma said, ""There will be no public function. People may light earthen lamps in various temples. Seers are also of the view that truth has triumphed so there is no relevance of the celebrations."" On November 30, Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas chief Mahant Nritya Gopal Das too had appealed against observing ""Shaurya Diwas"", saying there was no relevance left for it after the apex court verdict. Maulana Shafique Alam of Terhi Bazaar Masjid, which is in close proximity to the Ramjanmabhoomi, on Thursday said Friday prayers would be held in the mosque at 1 pm. ""Around 150-200 Muslims are likely to attend it,"" he said. Recalling developments on November 8, a day before the apex court gave its verdict, Shafique Alam said, ""There are around 40-50 Muslim families in this area, of which 30 had sent their womenfolk to other places. Some financially well-off people too shifted ahead of the Supreme Court judgment."" ""Most of them returned after November 14. There were no clashes, but people were feeling sad over the judgment. I too had gone to my native place in Bihar's Gaya and returned on November 19,"" he said, adding that police were very helpful. He, however, blamed ""outsiders"" for vitiating the atmosphere of Ayodhya, saying his Hindu neighbours were very nice. ""Even during marriage or any other celebrations in their households, they switch off the music system during namaaz,"" he said. Meanwhile, security is tight in the temple town with a senior Uttar Pradesh Police official saying the arrangements are similar to the plan they had devised for November 9, the day the apex court pronounced verdict on the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute. ""The security plan for December 6 will be a continuation of the plan we had devised for November 9,"" Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) PV Ramasastry told PTI, adding that the precautions taken by them were the same they had adopted on the judgment day.

Security beefed up in Aligarh and Mathura ahead of Babri demolition anniversary | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: Though the apex court has given its verdict on the Ayodhya Ram Mandir land dispute, district authorities in Mathura and Aligarh have strengthened security in the districts as a precautionary measure ahead of the Babri mosque demolition anniversary on December 6. Prohibitory orders have been imposed in the two districts. Talking to TOI, DM Aligarh CB Singh, said after the judgement, there is no need for anyone to celebrate or observe a black day on December 6. He said, however, a meeting of all public representatives, hindu organisations, and Babri Mosque action committee was called to appeal them to maintain peace in the district. He said, “though they all have assured not to organise any event, security has been beefed up in the city as a precautionary measure”. Addressing the meeting, Aligarh SSP said that if anyone tries to vitiate the atmosphere, they will be detained by the police. “I don’t want to take any harsh steps but would do everything for maintaining peaceful atmosphere in the town. If need be I’ll impose NSA too,” he warned. District authorities in Mathura issued an order for deployment of zonal, sector magistrates and police force in the city from Wednesday midnight till December 6 to ensure peaceful law and order situation.

KBC fastest-finger-first move behind Jamiat review hurry? | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Was it Kaun Banega Crorepati’s ‘fastest-finger-first’ effect that had the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind hurry into filing a review petition in Supreme Court on its verdict on the Ayodhya issue? UP Jamiat head Maulana Ashhad Rashidi had told TOI on Sunday evening that the body, which is a petitioner in the Ayodhya dispute, had decided to file the review petition on December 6. It instead went ahead and filed it on Monday, December 2. Sources told TOI that senior counsel for Muslim parties Rajeev Dhavan’s inputs for the review draft were also ignored in the final plea document. A day later, this seems to have triggered a storm as Dhavan announced on social media that he was “sacked by Jamiat advocate-on-record Ejaz Maqbool” and that he would “no longer (be) involved in the review or the case.” Sources privy to the case told TOI, soon after Dhavan’s post on social media went viral, that the seeming urgency in filing the review petition resembled the process of selection in the popular TV game show Kaun Banega Crorepati, where the fastest contestant to answer gets to be on the hot seat. Sources also revealed that Dhavan had earlier met Jamiat members and lawyers twice in Delhi to hammer out the review plea draft. A third meeting between the two was to be held on Monday. However, sources claimed Jamiat national president Arshad Madani decided to go ahead with the plea on Monday itself, which meant the petition filed in SC on Monday was not “settled” by senior most advocate Dhavan. In legal parlance, “settled” means a draft should have the final stamp of approval from the senior-most counsel before being filed. Elements of the draft, which had Dhavan’s sanction, were then not entered into the final review plea filed in court. His name was also removed from the plea, following Jamiat’s desire to file the plea on Monday itself, before anyone else did. Sources claimed that Dhavan had a dental emergency on Monday but Jamiat went ahead with the filing of the plea. An insider to the legal case also claimed Jamiat has, in the past, openly talked about how it was the first to have filed a review of Allahabad high court’s order in 2010, which had asked for division of the disputed land into three parts. “Any plea, not drafted well enough to stand ground, could have weakened the Muslim stand or even got the plea dismissed. Jamiat, convinced of the grounds prepared by its lawyers, may have wanted to pre-empt any such happening and hence went ahead, even if it meant not getting its senior counsel’s stamp of approval,” said an insider privy to what transpired between Sunday and Monday. Even after repeated attempts made by TOI to reach out to Jamiat’s press secretary Fazlur Rahman Qasmi through calls and messages, there was no response from the organization on it.

"Modi in Jamshedpur: PM Modi attacks JMM-Congress alliance, says it follows politics of deception | India News - Times of India","JAMSHEDPUR/KHUNTI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a two-pronged attack on the Congress, accusing it of procrastinating resolution of national issues like Article 370 and the Ayodhya dispute, and presiding over ""corrupt and unstable"" governments in Jharkhand. Stumping for BJP nominees for the Jharkhand assembly polls, Modi harped on the repeal of provisions of Article 370 that gave the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir its special status, and the Ayodhya tangle - themes that have underpinned both his and party chief Amit Shah's campaign rallies in the state. ""The talk of Article 370 was on since Independence. The Constitution said the article was a temporary provision. Article 370 is now gone from Jammu and Kashmir. ""Tell me whether the entire country has stood behind us on the issue or not. Tell me the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh have stood behind us on this or not. When things are done with good intentions, you have the blessings of the whole country,"" Modi told an election rally in Jamshedpur. Amid a roaring applause by the crowd, the prime minister spoke about the Ayodhya tangle. ""Did Ram Janmabhoomi (dispute) happen after we came to power? Was it not the Congress party that obstructed a resolution? Was it not done for vote bank politics?"" he asked an indulgent audience that shouted ""yes"" in emphatic endorsement. While speaking about the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, Modi sought to strike a chord with the vast tribal electorate in the state when he talked of Lord Ram's links with forest dwellers. ""Lord Ram left Ayodhya as a prince but returned as 'Maryada Purushottam' 14 years later as he spent time with Adivasis in forests, imbibed their values,"" he said. The prime minister said while the Congress only got things tangled up ""uljhaana"", it was left to the BJP to ""disentangle"" (suljhaana) difficult situations. He launched a blistering attack on the opposition JMM-Congress alliance in Jharkhand, alleging it followed the politics of ""deception"" while the BJP believed in serving people. Modi alleged rampant corruption and political instability were the hallmarks of the governments helmed by the JMM-Congress alliance. ""Even the chief minister's chair was up for sale. Until five years ago, Jharkhand used to be in news for political instability. It saw 10 chief ministers in 15 years before the BJP government led by Raghubar Das came and lasted a full term. Before him CMs got changed faster than the weather,"" he said. Modi cited his 13-year stint as the Gujarat chief minister as an example of what a stable government can achieve. ""Gujarat kahan se kahan pahunch gaya (see how Gujarat progressed),"" he said. He said the first phase of polling on November 30 had clearly shown that the ""backbone of naxalism has been broken"". The prime minister told the rally in Khunti that heavy polling proved people's faith in democracy and nation-building in an environment conducive for development. Modi asked voters to be wary of the opposition alliance as it was only interested in the ""loot of Jharkhand's resources"". At the rally in the steel city of Jamshedpur, Modi spoke extensively about steps taken by his government for improving the condition of labour force and industrial development. He said his government wanted to develop Jharkhand as a silk and textile hub. Jamshedpur, he said, had played a significant role in catapulting India to the position of second largest steel manufacturer in the world. ""My government has great concern for labourers, particularly those in the unorganised sector,"" he said, adding the 'Shram Yogi Mandhan Yojana', the pension scheme for labourers, will benefit a large number of people working in unorganised sector. All welfare programmes of the Centre were devised keeping in mind their welfare, he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

The Muslim litigants went to the site on November 17 and December 1, but were granted access only till Manas Bhawan, the administrative building of the site, and were denied entry in the area of makeshift temple. After Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had completed excavation at disputed site in 2003, the Allahabad high court had ordered fortnightly inspections of site and items found in excavation by litigants from both sides, the divisional commissioner, who is the receiver, district and ASI officers under the supervision of two judges as observers to ensure status quo is being maintained. Later, the Supreme Court had also ordered continuation of same arrangement. Muslim litigants Mufti Hasbullah and Iqbal Ansari visited the site on November 17, and claimed they were denied entry beyond Manas Bhawan, adding they had access to entire area before verdict.  Mufti Hasbullah and another litigant Mohammad Umar visited the site on December 1, but were denied entry. Mufti Hasbullah told TOI he has sent a complaint to Supreme Court-appointed observer and commissioner informing they were being denied entry in acquired area without any court sanction to this effect.

" Amit Shah sets 2024 deadline for NRC, says all infiltrators to be expelled by then | India News - Times of India","CHAKRADHARPUR/BAHARAGORA: BJP chief Amit Shah on Monday set a 2024 deadline for implementing the hugely divisive NRC across the country, asserting ""each and every"" infiltrator will be identified and expelled before the next general election. Notwithstanding the admission by some BJP leaders in West Bengal that apprehensions over the NRC had cost the party dearly in the recent bypolls there, the Union home minister told poll rallies in neighbouring Jharkhand that the nationwide exercise will be conducted despite reservations voiced by opposition parties. Oppn pins hopes on BJP allies in fight against CAB, ‘national NRC’""Today, I want to tell you that before the 2024 polls the NRC will be conducted across the country and each and every infiltrator identified and expelled. ""Rahul Baba (Congress leader Rahul Gandhi) says don't expel them. Where will they go, what will they eat? But I assure you that before the country goes to polls in 2024 all illegal immigrants will be thrown out,"" Shah told election rallies in Chakradharpur and Baharagora. Shah said national issues like uprooting terrorism, naxalism and construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya were as important in the Jharkhand elections as local matters like development. Raking up the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri mosque dispute once again, the BJP president alleged the Congress made attempts to thwart the hearing of the case in the Supreme Court. NRC process to be carried out in entire country: Amit Shah in Rajya Sabha""Congress leaders would tell the Supreme Court that there is no need for hearing the Ram Janmabhoomi case. With your (people's) backing, we submitted that it be taken forward, and the result is that the apex court has ruled that only a Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya,"" he said. He also attacked the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance, which is crossing swords with the BJP for electoral laurel in Jharkhand. The BJP leader also gave credit to the state's BJP government for ""uprooting"" the Maoist menace and for bringing in development. ""When Congress was in power, it fired upon students agitating for Jharkhand state and attacked them with batons. Now Hemant Soren (JMM leader) is sitting in the laps of the same Congress so he can become the chief minister,"" he said. Referring to the ""vikas ki Ganga"" flowing in Jharkhand because of the ""double engine"" growth the Centre and the state governments had ushered in together, Shah said the Modi government built AIIMS in Deoghar, and it will now construct an airport there and also in Bokaro, Dumka and Jamshedpur. About 20 lakh farmers have benefited from the crop insurance scheme, he said. Within five years, the Narendra Modi government and Raghubar Das dispensation uprooted naxalism and paved the way for the state's development, he said. He said Raghubar Das provided a ""zero corruption"" government and gave the state political stability. The Das government is the first in Jharkhand's history that will complete its full term in office. ""Rahul Gandhi is in Jharkhand today. I challenge him to give an account of what Congress governments have done for Jharkhand during 55 years of their rule. We will also give an account of what we have done in five years,"" he said. Targeting the opposition alliance, the BJP chief said, ""Parties that sell poll tickets, exploit adivasis, had opposed creation of Jharkhand and indulged in corruption involving millions and billions of rupees cannot take the state forward.""

 99 per cent Muslims want review of SC judgment on Ayodhya dispute: AIMPLB | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Sunday asserted that 99 per cent of Muslims in the country want a review of the unanimous Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhya dispute. The AIMPLB, which was not a party to the law suit, has previously said a review petition will be filed by December 9. A five-judge bench had ruled on November 9 that a temple should be built through a trust set up by the government on the disputed site, where the mosque was demolished in 1992. ""Muslims trust judiciary that is why a review petition is being filed. However, the trust has weakened after the SC verdict on Ayodhya,"" AIMPLB General Secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani told PTI. ""Ninety-nine per cent of Muslims of the country are in favour of a review petition. If it it understood that a big section is against this, it is wrong,"" he said. Rahmani, however, said they ""suspect our petition will be dismissed"". ""(But) it does not mean we don't file it. It's our legal right. There are many contradictory things in the verdict,"" he added. Asked about the suggestion that the decades-long dispute should end after the SC judgment, Rahmani said, ""They are those who did not have any interest in the mosque. They live in fear and want others to do so. ""Intellectuals raise this issue but they did not have any practical scheme to resolve issues of the Muslim community.

 Parties in power milked Ayodhya for votes: PM Modi | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In an apparent swipe at Congress, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the Ayodhya matter could have been resolved much sooner but political parties which were in power earlier did not show the will to settle it as they saw it as a ""vote bank"" issue.' At a media event in the national capital, Modi also said Article 370 was a temporary provision in the Constitution but due to ""some families"", it was considered permanent. ""You know what India has suffered because of Articles 370 and 35A and you have also seen how this challenge has been resolved,"" Modi said, referring to his government's abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of J&K into two Union territories. Modi said the Ayodhya dispute lingered for years in various courts. ""The parties which ruled the country earlier didn't show the will to resolve the issue... rather they used it for vote bank,"" he added. The PM said opposition parties had an ecosystem through which they circulated fake stories about the initiatives taken by his government. ""Several country heads have hailed the Aadhaar scheme but the opposition parties were so much opposed to it that they went to court against the changes,"" he claimed and added that there were several shortcomings in the biometric cards, which were improved after he took over.

Modi said the rivals went against GST too and it could not have been implemented if they had been in power. ""Many governments fell trying to introduce such reforms"".

Vishwa Hindu Parishad to record memoirs of Ram temple movement for posterity | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Vishwa Hindu Parishad has started cataloguing minute details of events during the Ram temple movement that eventually led to demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya and people who took part in it. With the Supreme Court verdict paving the way for a temple of Ram Lalla at Ramjanmabhoomi, the right wing organisation has asked its cadres to fan out across the country and collect details and memoirs of kar sevaks, who took part in the movement that peaked with the Ram Rath Yatra taken out by BJP leader LK Advani. VHP sources said the organisation has preserved the list of people who were channelized in the movement. “All those people would be contacted for collecting details of their experience. The coming generations need to be told about the movement that changed the political landscape of the country,” VHP organisation secretary (east UP) Ambrish Singh told TOI. The families of kar sevaks who died while participating in the Ram temple movement would also be contacted for collecting details.

Anchal Singh Veera, a resident of Suakheda, near Bhopal, was grievously injured when the dome of Babri Masjid crumbled and has been confined to bed for past 27 years. The audio cassettes and video recordings of the fiery speeches of right wing leaders which were heavily circulated at the peak of the movement would also be collected.

But while agreeing that the court order is judicially flawed, we strongly believe that keeping the Ayodhya dispute alive will harm, and not help, Indian Muslims,” said the statement. Javed Anand, who is also secretary of Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy, said it is high time the Muslims moved away from the mandir-masjid dispute as it helps to mask the real agenda of the Sangh Parivar, which is to replace the secular-democratic republic with a Hindu Rashtra. The signatories to the statement observed that continuation of the dispute will add fuel to anti-Muslim propaganda and Islamophobia and aid communal polarisation. “In choosing not to pursue the matter further, Muslims stand to gain the goodwill and empathy of the non-communal millions from the majority community. This will be in the best interests of the community and the country,” they said. At a meeting in Lucknow last week, the Muslim Personal Law Board and one faction of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind decided that some Muslim litigants would go for review of the Supreme Court verdict, which gave the entire disputed land in Ayodhya to the Hindus while ordering the Centre to allot five acres in Ayodhya to the Muslims to build their mosque.

OBCs get 14% reservations in the state but there is a demand to increase this to 27%. Ajsu Party, which has fielded candidates in 31 seats as it is unhappy with just seven seats it has got from BJP in the alliance, has already promised to hike reservations for OBCs to 27% in its manifesto.

 Ayodhya: Security stepped up ahead of Babri demolition anniversary | India News - Times of India,"AYODHYA: Security arrangements in Ayodhya have been strengthened ahead of the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition on December 6, a top official said today. Security around Ramjanmabhoomi, which falls in the 'red zone' high-security area, has been stepped up and other landmark religious sites around it are also under tight vigil, Ayodhya DM Anuj Jha told PTI. ""We had kept a hawk-eye vigil across the temple town and other parts of the district till the verdict, and security will remain intensified till the Babri (Masjid) demolition anniversary,"" he said. ""Our next challenge would be to maintain calm, peace and harmony on December 6, though I am positive that people of Ayodhya will display utmost maturity as they are peace-loving,"" Jha said. The Ayodhya security cover has four zones -- red zone for the 2.77 acres disputed site, yellow zone for the city, green zone for the district and blue zone for the neighbouring areas of the district. Streets in red zone areas and those leading to the zone are being kept under tight watch and barricades in these places which were put up ahead of the verdict will continue to be there till December 6, the District Magistrate said. A week after the Supreme Court's verdict in the communally sensitive Ayodhya land dispute case, vigil around important religious sites such as Hanuman Garhi, Kanak Bhawan and Ram ki Paidi remained heightened on Saturday and security personnel also guarded important public places. A high alert remained around the Ramjanmabhoomi site even as thousands of devotees streamed in to pay obeisance to Lord Ram. The Ayodhya district magistrate also said Section 144 clamped on November 8 will remain in place till December 28. The section prohibits unlawful assembly of four or more people. Jha asserted that people of Ayodhya have ""very peacefully and maturely reacted"" to the Supreme Court verdict as ""expected"" by the administration. ""If people outside can take the message of Ayodhya, nothing untoward will happen anywhere else in the country in the wake of the judgement,"" he added. Settling a fractious issue that goes back more than a century, the Supreme Court in a historic verdict on November 9 backed the construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town. Amid heightened security, members of the Muslim community on Friday offered prayers at various mosques in Ayodhya district, the first 'jumma namaz' after the landmark verdict. ""Friday namaz was offered by people at various mosques in Ayodhya district. Security was stepped up at all mosques for the day, including in rural areas. ""We had also alerted our officers at ground level to immediately report any protest, such as sporting of black arm bands by anyone. Everything went off peacefully,"" Jha said. Security forces have been keeping a hawk-eye vigil over the holy town since the evening of November 8, a day before the judgement was announced, even as a security apparatus was put in place days before in anticipation of the SC's decision. A posse of security personnel have been deployed through out the holy town since November 8. Regular check-posts set up in the streets have remained in place, alongside patrolling parties on roads which intensified vigil at night. Police officials have been keeping tight vigil on social media too to trace any inflammatory statements or posts. Besides, 45 CCTV cameras recently installed around important sites such as Hanuman Garhi, Kanak Bhawan, Dashrath Mahal and Ram ki Paidi are being fed to a centralised control room and monitored by Ayodhya SSP to spot if anyone ""attempts any mischief"", Jha said. Ahead of the verdict, lakhs of devotees visited the pilgrimage town for 14 Kosi and 5 Kosi Yatras. On the auspicious Hindu occasion of Kartik Purnima on November 12, over five lakh pilgrims converged in the city. ""It all went off peacefully as we had made adequate preparations,"" Jha said. ""Schools and colleges reopened from November 13 in Ayodhya and in some areas we have removed barriers that impeded movement of children and in other areas we have made it a bit easier to navigate while keeping overall security in mind,"" Jha said. On December 6, 1992, a frenzied army of kar sewaks had demolished the historic Babri Masjid that was built in 1528 by Mughal emperor Babur. A large section of Hindus and right-wing outfits believe that the mosque was built by destroying a Ram temple that stood on the birthplace of Lord Ram, a claim rejected by Muslims. The mosque's demolition had triggered unrest in Ayodhya in 1992 and communal riots in various parts of the country. Right-wing outfits Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal celebrate December 6 as 'Shaurya Diwas' (glory day) while Muslim organisations mark it as 'Yaum e Gam' (day of sorrow).

 UP govt marks afresh acquired Ayodhya land | India News - Times of India,"AYODHYA: The Ayodhya district administration has begun preparations for a fresh demarcation of acquired land at the Ramjanmabhoomi site. In January 1993, the Union government had acquired 67.63 acres through the Acquisition of Certain Area of Ayodhya Act, 1993. This land includes Kot Ramchandar, Jalwanpur and Awadh Khas of Ayodhya tehsil. Highly placed sources told TOI that the local administration has been asked to measure the acquired land for more clarity before a trust is formally constituted, as ordered by the Supreme Court, for the building of a Ram temple. Ayodhya commissioner Manoj Mishra refused to reveal details of the demarcation process but said “paimaish (measurement)” of the acquired land will be done according to the requirement of the trust. According to Section 3 of the Acquisition Act of 1993 (No 33 of 1993), the rights, title and interest of the acquired land vest with the Union government. The acquired land includes residential houses, agricultural land, temples and Muslim graveyards. Meanwhile, in the ongoing tussle for control of the proposed trust, the All India Akhara Parishad has demanded that its general secretary be made an ex-officio member of the trust along with those who fought a protracted legal battle for ownership of the disputed land.

" Controversy over Ayodhya trust irrelevant, Centre to follow SC directives: VHP | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: After several Hindu outfits have put forth their demand that the task of construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya should be entrusted to their existing trusts, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Friday said such demands are ""irrelevant"" because Supreme Court has asked the Centre to set up a new trust that will be handed the responsibility of constructing the shrine.  In an interview to ANI, Secretary-General of VHP Milind Parande said saints and other outfits have been expressing different views regarding the trust as they had been associated with Ram Janmabhoomi movement but it is the Centre which has to take the final call.  ""The movement for Ram temple was started by Saints. They have been associated with it which is why different views are coming on the trust. But all these demands are of no use as the Supreme Court has asked the Centre to set up the trust. The central government has to obey the Supreme Court directives,"" he said.  Parande also believes that saints have their right to express their views but all such demands are ""irrelevant"" because the Center is bound to follow the orders of the top court.  ""There is a democracy in the country and all of them are free to express their views. We hope that in the given timeframe, the Centre would set up the trust according to the faith of Hindus and in accordance with the court's order.""  The VHP leader's remarks came in the wake of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas and Ramalaya Trust demanding that there was no need for any trust as they already existed for the construction of the temple.  The Supreme Court on November 9 put an end to the 70-year legal battle over the disputed site in Ayodhya where the Babri Masjid stood before its demolition in 1992.  The five-judge Supreme Court bench led by CJI Ranjan Gogoi ruled in favour of Ram Lalla and said the entire disputed land spread over 2.7 acres will be handed over to a trust formed by the government, which will monitor the construction of a Ram temple at the site.  Speaking further on the same, Parande also stated that saints do not expect any fund from the Centre for the construction of the temple as the Hindus are capable enough.""Ram temple is an issue of faith for us. So there will be no scarcity of funds for its construction. We already have funds and if needed we will raise it,"" he said.  Hitting out at Sunni Waqf Board and Jamiat Ulma-E-Hind for questioning the court's verdict and mulling the review plea, Parande said that the verdict of the apex court was justice for all.  ""Justice has been done. There is no meaning in all such debates,"" he said.  The senior VHP functionary said that the Babari mosque at the temple site was a disregard for Hindu society and dignity was restored on December 6, 1992, after its demolition.  ""Now the hurdles in the way of Ram temple have been removed, we will continue to celebrate December 6 as shaurya diwas with more fervour,"" he said.

 No need for govt to set up trust for Ram temple as one already exists: Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas chief | India News - Times of India,"AYODHYA: There is no need for the government to set up a new trust for the Ram Temple as directed by the Supreme Court because the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas already exists, its president Mahant Nritya Gopal Das said on Wednesday. Ram Janambhoomi Nyas is an organisation run by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). Mahant Nritya Gopal Das said in a statement that there is no need of forming a new trust. ""The trust (Ram Janambhoomi Nyas) already exists. We can give a shape to it and new members can be added as per need,"" he said. Other seers associated with the Ram Temple movement expressed differing views on the establishment of the trust. Mahant Suresh Das, chief of the Digambar Akhara , said that the apex court had clearly said the new trust was to be formed by the government. ""It is the responsibility of the Union government to set up the trust and not of the Ram Janambhoomi Nyas. But representatives of the nyas should be in the trust,"" he said.

"Ram temple will elevate Ayodhya as ‘maha teerthraj’, say devotees | Lucknow News - Times of India","AYODHYA: Buoyed by the Supreme Court verdict in favour of Ram temple, pilgrims visiting Ayodhya on the occasion of Kartik Purnima on Tuesday said it would elevate the status of the temple town among pilgrimages in the country. “At present, Ayodhya is known as teerthraj (king of all pilgrimages) because the birth of Lord Ram is celebrated here every day. But the construction of Ram temple will turn this place into maha teerthraj (emperor of all pilgrimages),” said Mahant Girishpati Tripathi of Tewari Mandir. Citing a chaupai (verse) from Ramcharitamanas, he said, “Jai din ram janam shruti gavahi, teerath sakal tahan chali avahi” (the day song on the birth of Lord Ram was sung, all pilgrimages of the world came to Ayodhya.” Elated over SC judgment, Mainarani Pathak, a pilgrim from Gorakhpur, said: “Ram Lalla is worshipped in all temples of Ayodhya. The city reverberates with the chant of bhaye pragat kripala deen dayala, Kaushalya hitkari every day. The absence of Ram’s temple at his birth place (Ramjanmabhoomi site) was strongly felt by devotees. Now that the temple will come up at that spot, Ayodhya is set to witness grand celebrations.” “Followers of Ram associated with Ayodhya are known as naam upasaks, meaning they chant Ram’s name with everything. This chanting generates positive energy in devotees,” said Ashok Kumar, a retired government employee.

December 6 anniversary will be a low-key affair for VHP this year | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: For the first time in 27 years, the anniversary of Babri Masjid demolition on December 6 will be a low key affair for Vishwa Hindu Parishad this time.

" Ayodhya: VHP suggests Shah, Yogi be included in proposed temple trust | India News - Times of India","AYODHYA: As the Centre has set the ball rolling for setting up a Supreme Court-mandated trust for construction of a temple at Ramjanmabhoomi site in Ayodhya, right-wing organisation Vishwa Hindu Parishad has suggested that Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath be included in it. VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma on Wednesday here also reiterated the outfit's hope that the trust would build a grand temple as per the design prepared by the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas (RJN). The Nyas has been running a sprawling workshop in Ayodhya's Karsewakpuram since 1990 and artisans and craftsmen have fashioned out magnificently carved stones and pillars over these years, with the assumption that one day it will be used to build a temple for Ram Lallah. As per the RJN plan, the temple, once built, will be 268 ft long, 140 ft wide and 128 ft high, from the ground to the apex point (Shikhar) and a total of 212 pillars will be used, according to 79-year-old Annu Bhai Sompura, in-charge of the workshop. The Ram Janmabhomi Nyas is supported by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, whose members volunteer services at the workshop. ""Over these nearly 30 years since the inception of the workshop, we have been taking the design of this temple to people's homes through various means of communication. Devotees too have taken pictures and videos and spread the word. So, that is the dominant image of a Ram temple in the consciousness of the people,"" Sharma said. ""We are hopeful that the new trust that the government will constitute will not only have representation from the RJN, but will also build the grand temple as per the architectural plan made by the Nyas,"" he said. A wooden model of a 'proposed Ram Temple' in a glass encasement has been kept at the workshop site for over two decades, and many devotees stream in from various parts of India to see the model and beautifully carved stones, after visiting the Ramjanmabhoomi site. ""We also feel that Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi be made a part of the trust, and if needed, exceptions be made for their inclusion,"" Sharma told PTI, and cited Sree Somnath Trust's inception to buttress his point. ""K M Munshi, who was at that time (early post Independence) a minister in the Union cabinet, was in it (Somnath trust). The Ram temple trust should be formed on the lines of the Somnath trust,"" he added. Settling a fractious issue that goes back more than a century, the Supreme Court in a historic verdict on Saturday backed the construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town. Days after the judgement, the Centre has started the process of setting up a trust, as mandated by the apex court in its Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid verdict, with a team of officers examining the order threadbare, officials said on Monday. Opinions of the Ministry of Law and the attorney general will be taken on how to proceed on setting up the trust that will fix the modalities for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. A team of officials have been tasked with studying the top court order threadbare for its technicality and nuances so that the trust can be constituted exactly as per the verdict. Asked what were his expectations on the role of the RJN in the proposed trust, Sharma said, ""I am very optimistic that the Ramjanmabhom Nyas, which has been given the land by the apex court in its historic verdict, will be accorded a priority given its background struggle to get a temple built at the site."" Nearly 65 per cent of the work on carving of stones has been completed and the section needed for the ground floor of the temple as per the design of the RJN is ready, he said, adding, ""the work was going on till four months ago, but halted now"". The stones are carefully numbered and can be joined like a ""jigsaw puzzle"" using white cement when needed, the VHP leader said. At the workshop, some of the pink sandstones which were carved intricately in the early 90s have darkened over the decades but these will be washed up once the time comes for their use, said Hanuman Yadav, a VHP worker and caretaker and guardian of the workshop, as he points towards lintels and columns and ceiling blocks, bearing beautiful floral motifs. He also claimed that demands have come from some quarters to include Muslim representatives in the trust. The framework of the trust is yet to emerge, so it is ""wait and watch"" as of now, he added. Asked if the proposed trust draws out a fresh plan for the Ram temple, Sharma said, ""We are very optimistic about the RJN plan getting accepted by the trust, or at least be included in the grand temple design. These stones have been carved over decades with money donated by people."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 How Guru Nanak played a ‘role’ in Ayodhya verdict | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The SC verdict on Saturday that settled the Ayodhya dispute has a historical nugget tucked away in its 1,045 pages that many might not have known about — the Sikh connection in what has been seen as a Hindu-Muslim tussle. An evidence that helped strengthen the Hindu side’s claim to the disputed site was the visit by Guru Nanak Dev to Ayodhya for Ram Janmabhoomi darshan in 1510-11 AD. Babri Masjiddid not come up until after the 1526 Battle of Panipat. More than three centuries later, in 1857, a Nihang Sikh barged inside the mosque and occupied it for a considerable amount of time, even setting up a platform on which an idol of Lord Ram was placed. With a posse of 25 Sikhs standing guard outside, the Nihang Sikh lit a fire and started arrangements for puja, leading to the first recorded instance of friction between Hindus and Muslims over the structure. The Nihang Sikh scrawled “Ram” on the walls of the mosque, according to police complaint. The addenda to verdict bring on record the Janam Sakhis, or writings that profess to be biographies of Guru Nanak Dev. On the question of “whether the disputed structure is the birthplace of Lord Ram according to belief of Hindu devotees”, the SC says there is no material to identify the exact place of Ram Janmabhoomi. But it recognises the visit of Guru Nanak Dev to Ayodhya as an event depicting visits by pilgrims even before 1528 AD. The judgment says, “It is found that in period prior to 1528 AD, there were sufficient religious texts, which led Hindus to believe the present site of Ram Janmabhoomi as birthplace of Lord Ram.” One of the witnesses in suit number 4, during his examination in Allahabad HC, had referred to books on Sikh cult and history. He said Guru Nanak Dev had sought darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi temple. To his statement, he appended various Janam Sakhis documenting the visit of Guru Nanak Dev to Ayodhya. The verdict also traces a second event that occurred against the backdrop of 1857 transfer of power, when complaints sent to the Oudh administration (as Ayodhya and nearby areas were then referred to) reported the presence of Sikhs. A complaint in 1860 to deputy commissioner of Oudh said local Muslims were facing problems in performing namaz at the mosque. “The Azaan of Moazzin was met with the blowing of conch shells by Hindus. A contentious situation was arising. The Nihang Sikh was evicted from the site and a record was maintained,” SC notes, deducing that it showed namaz was at that stage being performed in the mosque. That incident led to the installation of a railing in the form of a grill-brick wall outside the mosque. It was also the genesis of division of the complex into an inner courtyard (in which stood the structure of the mosque) and outer courtyard. “The construction of a railing in 1856-7 to provide a measure of separation between the inner and outer courtyards led to the construction of a platform by Hindus in close proximity to railing in outer courtyard. The platform, called Ramchabutra, became a place of worship for Hindus,” states the verdict.

 VHP decides to construct Ram temple through crowd-funding | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: VHP has decided to seek contributions for the proposed Ram Mandir and has also decided to explore ways to enlist the involvement of Ram bhakts in its construction, potentially setting the stage for yet another mass mobilisation for the Ayodhya temple. “Ram bhakts (devotees) from across the country will be approached for contribution to the construction of the Ram temple. The Ayodhya movement was associated with the faith and sentiments of scores of Hindus and they will have to do their bit, including ‘kar seva’, whenever the project begins,” said Vinod Bansal, national spokesperson of VHP, the Sangh affiliate which spearheaded the campaign for the construction of the temple. “A formal plan will be out soon,” Bansal told TOI. Besides, VHP has decided to suggest that the trust that is to be formed within three months should facilitate the symbolic participation of “bhakts” in the construction of what has been imagined as a “grand Ram temple”. Devotees from all 718 districts of the country will be invited in delegations to stay for at least a week and help in construction work, said the VHP functionary, an indication that another round of “kar seva” could be in the works. “Kar seva”, or voluntary work, formed an important part of the VHP-led “Mandir” movement with lakhs reaching Ayodhya in 1990, and again in 1992, the second round resulting in the demolition of Babri Masjid. VHP functionaries in Delhi confirmed the crowd-funding plan. “There is no ambiguity about the plan that funds will be pooled in directly from Hindu devotees of Lord Ram spread across the globe. The process to seek contributions will start soon for which teams will be constituted to ensure that it is done smoothly,” VHP working president Alok Kumar told TOI. He said VHP has pledged only to use contributions from people for temple construction. VHP’s statements come amid reinforced indications that it will have a significant representation in the temple trust. The Supreme Court had, in its verdict on Saturday, denied any role for VHP-promoted Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas in temple construction. However, sources said the government, which will have the final say in the matter, appears inclined to include in the trust Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, who headed the Nyas, as well as some of the key Hindu seers aligned with VHP. The decision to pool funds is in sync with what Mahatma Gandhi had suggested when he offered his support for the reconstruction of the Somnath temple. Gandhi gave his consent to the move to revive the temple, which had been attacked and plundered repeatedly by invaders, but told the prime movers — Sardar Patel and K M Munshi —that they should not take money from the government. “For a temple dedicated to Lord Ram, funds must come from the public. Taxpayer money should not have any role in the project. We shall start the fund collection once the trust takes over,” Kumar said. “Some people may contribute shilas (sandstone), while others may donate money. We leave everything to people,” he added. VHP sources in Ayodhya said they expect the construction to begin around Makar Sankranti in January or Ram Navami in April next year. “The ball is in the court of the government which has to take a call on the issue,” said a senior VHP functionary. VHP functionaries said enlisting popular support for the construction of the temple will be a respectful gesture to the devotees, who have waited “generations” to see it happen. “We shall urge the trust to allow the visit of delegations from each district of the country to hand out a brick for the construction,” Kumar said. He said over 60% of the temple has already been carved but construction will start after complying with the norms. “We have to abide by the norm as the temple will be dedicated to ‘Maryada Purushottam’.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 ‘Verdict perfect like Taj Mahal’ | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Archaeologist and former director of ASI’s northern region K K Muhammed has hailed the Supreme Court verdict settling the decades-long Ayodhya dispute “perfect like the Taj Mahal”, where there is no scope for improvement. Muhammed, who came under attack for his assertions that a large non-Islamic structure existed under the Babri Masjid — a finding the apex court noted in its order — said the SC judgment had left him feeling vindicated. He also welcomed culture minister Prahlad Patel’s announcement that the ASI report — which finds detailed mention in the order — will be published as a book for public consumption. “I was maligned and attacked. And there was even a threat to my life, because of which I was provided security. But I took a stand and stood my ground. The court delivered a finely balanced judgment, one that has shown great foresight,” Muhammed told TOI over phone from Kozhikode, adding that the judgment had brought a sense of relief to both Hindu and Muslim communities. “In 1986, Muslims had come very close to handing over the mosque to Hindus following talks between PM Rajiv Gandhi and Ali Mian Nadwi. But despite Nadwi’s best efforts, Muslims backed out at the last minute, thereby squandering a golden opportunity to earn goodwill among the Hindus,” he said. The archaeologist was part of the 10-member excavation team that visited Ayodhya in 1976-77, and had unearthed, among other things, 12 pillars, a ‘makara pranali’— the image of a crocodile, which is a symbol of river Ganga — and the ‘amalaka’, all of which pointed to the presence of a non-Islamic structure before the Babri Masjid came up in Ayodhya. Acknowledging that he was happy to see the court rule in favour of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Muhammed suggested building a university, rather than a mosque, on the five acre plot of land that the SC has said would be given to the Muslim parties. “I am not with the extremists on Hindu or Muslim side. I believe that demolition of the mosque was wrong. But Ram Janmabhoomi is as sacred to Hindus as Mecca and Medina are to Muslims. Now that the court has given its verdict, we should move on,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"Ayodhya judgment ends Ram’s second exile, won’t install idol now: Priest | Lucknow News - Times of India","AYODHYA: Mahant Satyendra Das, the caretaker head priest at Ramjanmabhoomi, who was apppointed in 1992 to look after the Ram Lalla in the make-shift temple said he would not prefer immediate installation of the idol till the temple construction is complete. He also said that the Supreme Court verdict has ended the second over 26-year ‘vanvaas’ (exile) of the Lord. “Jaise prabhu ne vanvaas jhela tha 14 varsh tak, 26 varsh se adhik who tirpal (tent) mein pade rahe. Bina Ram ki kripa ke kuchh nahi hota. Ab kripa ho gayee hai, ab taat se uthkar bhavya mandir mein virajmaan honge (Like the Lord was on 14-year exile, he stayed under a tent for over 26 years.

The 82-year-old was appointed by the Allahabad high court to bathe, feed and dress the Ram Lalla idol and has been taking care of the Lord since March 1, 1992. Das said the verdict is not an occasion for celebrations. “Both the communities had decided that we would respect and follow whatever SC orders. We should do that now,” he said. The Sanskrit scholar also said that he would extend all help to Muslims when the mosque will be built at an alternate site, saying Lord Ram’s teachings showed love for all Ayodhyavasis, irrespective of their faith. “Whoever is close to Ram is close to his followers. Ayodhvasis are neither Hindus nor Muslims, not Sikhs or Christians either. So, all Ayodhyavasis will be treated with the same love as during Ram rajya,” insisted Das. He said Nirmohi Akhara didn’t have sufficient papers to back its claim on the land of Ram Chabootra and Sita Rasoi and hence SC ruled against it. He said that he was happy with the recent salary hike of Ram Lalla staff two months ago, but the SC verdict in favour of Ramjanmabhoomi was biggest of all happiness In Video:Ayodhya judgment ends Ram’s second exile: Head PriestDownload The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"After Ayodhya verdict, these feuding brothers hope for truce | Lucknow News - Times of India","AYODHYA: Even as the Supreme Court on Saturday ended the Ayodhya dispute with verdict in favour of Ram temple, two feuding restaurateur brothers on the stretch leading to the site kept wooing visitors in a bid to scale up their cash registers. Achal Gupta and his brother Vikram have been running vegetarian restaurant, Chandra Bhojnalaya, since 1990. The two had split over who would inherit the legacy six years ago. The other reason was who would sell fast food, including Chinese fare and pure Indian vegetarian dishes. On Saturday, the two welcomed the verdict with fanfare yet with a sheepish grin that they would sink their differences if Lord Ram wills. “I will leave everything to Lord Ram. It’s he who grew my business. My brother doesn’t talk to me but our kids sometimes exchange greetings. May be this victory will bring us close again” said Achal. The younger brother, whose restaurant shares the wall with that of Achal, has retained the same name but prefixed it with his son Ayush’s name. Vikram’s family, including his son, though believe that their dispute is nothing compared to the land fight between Hindus and Muslims. “At least there was no bloodsheed. Financial matters always have some problems,” said Vikram’s son. As the Section 144CrPC restricted open sale and throwing of eggs, meat and mutton in the town, the Gupta brothers had a gala time bringing customers, including several from media crew.

"Who’s raising Kashi, Mathura, asks Murli Manohar Joshi | Nagpur News - Times of India","NAGPUR: Veteran BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, who was also in the forefront of Ram Janmabhoomi movement, appeared to be ruling out raising similar demand for temples in Mathura and Kashi (Varanasi). Like the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Hindu right wing groups had raised a demand for building temples on sites having mosques at Mathura and Kashi also. “Who is raising such demands for Mathura and Kashi,” Joshi countered on a question whether demand for temples at these two sites would also be raised after Ayodhya. The BJP veteran was in the city to attend a function to kick off centenary celebrations of Dattopant Thengdi, founder of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the trade union wing of RSS.On further action to be taken on building the temple, Joshi said it is to be done by the Ramjanmabhoomi Trust to be formed by the government. Replying to a question on action to be taken against demolition of the mosque in December 1992, he said the case is already going on. Joshi hailed the supreme court judgment saying it has been fair to all the parties. Former speaker of Lok Sabha, Sumitra Mahajan, who also attended the function said it was a matter of joy that finally Lord Ram has got his place back. Earlier addressing the function, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat stressed on the need of having social harmony which he said was strongly advocated by Thengdi too. Bhagwat said “Thengdi had the good fortune of being closely associated with Dr Babasaheb Ambekdar, which also shaped his thoughts.” “There is a need to finish inequalities in the society. However, for that differences need to be rooted out right from the peoples’s thoughts,” he said. Thengdi was open to all ideologies but was not bound by any single thought. He was also open to hand over reins to another person having a better ability for a certain task, said Bhagwat. The RSS chief cited examples from Italian war of independence when leaders handed over responsibility to the right person each time themselves stepping aside.

"Prince of Arcot hails top court verdict on Ayodhya dispute, urges people to resist pseudo-nationalism | Chennai News - Times of India","CHENNAI: Prince of Arcot Nawab Mohammed Abdul Ali on Sunday welcomed the Supreme Court’s verdict on the long-pending Ayodhya dispute. “It has finally brought closure to what looked like an intractable dispute between the two major communities of India,” he said in a statement, adding that Muslims must find solace that the Supreme Court did not agree with the contention that Babri Masjid was built after demolishing a temple. “Supreme Court has reiterated the fact that both the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 and the surreptitious placing of idols in 1949 in the structure were illegal. Therefore, those responsible for the demolition must be brought to book,” he said. He also appealed to the people of India, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, to work together for the steady progress and development of the country, which can be achieved only by improving the socio-economic conditions of the masses, not by creating conflicts over places of worship. “Let us not give any quarter to communalism and pseudo-nationalism.

" Ayodhya verdict: Congress sees opportunity to reclaim lost ground, endorses construction of temple | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court giving finality to the Ayodhya dispute could provide an opportunity to the Congress, which was quick to endorse early construction of a Ram temple, to win back the confidence of the majority population and shrug off the charge of ""minority appeasement"". A section of party leaders feel that despite having initiated the process of starting prayers at the disputed site way back in 1986, the Congress has suffered electoral losses in the Hindi heartland, particularly Uttar Pradesh, since the demolition of the Babri mosque under its regime in 1992. As the Congress's fortunes dipped, its arch rival BJP emerged as the clear gainer, riding on the Ram Janmabhoomi movement to national limelight and subsequent electoral victories. ""After 26 years, the Supreme Court has done exactly the same thing that the Congress party had sought to do through an Act of Parliament,"" Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told PTI. The leaders claimed that though the Narasimha Rao government was blamed for failing to stall its demolition, it was the Congress which initiated the mediation 26 years ago and wanted the construction of a Ram temple through consensus or through court order. But the BJP, which used the matter to polarise people and reap electoral gains, did not support the party's proposals, the leaders said. They said it was then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi who on February 1, 1986 got the permission for starting prayers at the disputed site and got the locks opened. Thereafter, the 'shilanyas puja' was held in 1989, they say. They also claimed that the then Congress government at the Centre also brought the Ayodhya Act in January 1993 ""to acquire the site of the disputed structure (2.77 acres) and suitable adjacent land (64 acres) for setting up a complex"" that would have a temple dedicated to Lord Ram. This was stated by then Home Minister S B Chavan in Parliament. They said the party-led government planned to build ""a Ram temple, a mosque, amenities for pilgrims, a library, museum and other suitable facilities"" at the site, but the BJP opposed it then. ""After 26 years, the Supreme Court has done exactly the same thing that the Congress party had sought to do through an Act of Parliament - The Ayodhya Act in 1993, vis-a-vis construction of the Ram temple, a mosque and a museum, but the BJP had vehemently opposed the construction of the temple by Government of India, with its Vice-President SS Bhandari calling the Act as 'partisan, petty and perverse',"" Surjewala said. Former law minister Ashwani Kumar, who was additional solicitor general during Rajiv Gandhi's tenure as prime minister, said no political party or side should now reopen or seek to find fault with today's Supreme Court decision, even if it is not seen as perfect. ""This is particularly so since the Congress has paid a huge price in terms of polarisation, social and religious divides generated by the controversy. Political parties will be doing a great disservice to seek political gains from this judgement,"" Kumar said. He said matters of faith and religious sensitivity are best addressed in a non-partisan judicial forum which has now happened. He added that the SC verdict on the sensitive and contentious issue must now receive a final closure, considering a detailed and credible analysis of the contentions of respective parties. Former Union minister of state for home Subodh Kant Sahai claims that the Congress always wanted the issue to be resolved through consensus, but the BJP never allowed so and wanted to make it an emotive and ideological issue to gain political dividend. The steps taken by the Congress in resolving the issue through consensus came to nought after the demolition of the mosque on December 6, 1992 and all discussion in this regard proved futile, he said. ""I am happy that the Supreme Court did not talk about rights and considered the issue of faith and centered around temple construction...everyone should maintain peace and calm. But the question remains on whether those associated with the government will be supportive in maintaining peace or will continue to treat it as an issue of victory or loss,"" Sahai told PTI. ""The Supreme Court verdict should be limited to temple construction and should bring an end to politics by those who vitiated the atmosphere,"" he said. Congress leader and former Uttar Pradesh minister Pramod Tiwari said, ""The BJP has always said that this is an issue of faith and it cannot be resolved in the court ... But the Congress has stood by what it always said. The BJP has been befooling the people by taking advantage of Ayodhya issue, but the court decision has brought an end to the issue and everyone will have to follow it now."" Another minister in the Rajiv Gandhi government, KK Tewary, said the BJP owes its rise to the Ayodhya movement. ""The BJP cannot make much out of it now as the matter now rests after the SC verdict,"" he said. Settling a fractious issue that goes back more than a century, the Supreme Court in a historic verdict on Saturday backed the construction of a Ram temple by a government trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town.

On Saturday afternoon, the Eid-Miladunnabi (central) committee decided not to take out the procession to celebrate the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammed on Sunday. The committee was granted permission for the procession by the city police commissioner and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) also resolved to make certain arrangements for the devotees. A statement issued by the committee said its members held a meeting and resolved to call off the celebration on the day of the festival. It is necessary to maintain peace, harmony as well as law and order situation in the state. Fearing that anti-social elements may disrupt the peace during the procession, particularly as the situation is tense after the Ayodhya verdict, the committee resolved to call off the annual event. Earlier, legal proceedings took place in the Gujarat high court for a week, seeking permission to take out the Eid-e-Milad procession in the city. An unregistered organization by the same name had approached the Gujarat high court for permission for the procession. The city police commissioner thought it fit to grant permission to the committee because it is a registered trust, whereas permission was denied to the unregistered organization. The high court permitted the unregistered organizations to participate in the procession and ordered all entities to maintain harmony on the day of the festival. After passing the resolution calling off the celebration, the committee appealed to devotees to cooperate it in its decision, to maintain the law and order situation in the city.

The party pointed out that Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav was CM from 2012 to 2017 but he did not visit Ram Lalla even once. “Since 1992, when the disputed structure was brought down, all leaders refrained from visiting Ram Lalla. Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra never visited Ram Lalla,” said a BJP functionary. Sources in Gorakhnath Math said all major events related to Ramjanmabhoomi movement have had some link or with Gorakshpeeth. “The agitation itself started under the leadership of Mahant Digvijay Nath. On the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949, when idol of Ram Lalla appeared at the site, then Mahant Digvijay Nath was singing bhajans with other seers,” claimed a source. Digvijay Nath was appointed Hindu Mahasabha general secretary and won election from Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat in 1967, he added. Subsequently, in 1986 when then Faizabad DM gave orders to open the locks of the disputed site to allow Hindus to offer prayers there, Mahant Avaidyanath was present at the site to open the lock. Thereafter, under the leadership of Avaidyanath, Gorakhnath Temple became the centre of the Ramjanmabhoomi agitation, he said. “And now, when the apex court order has cleared the way for the construction of Ram temple, Yogi Adityanath, the current Mahant of temple, is the chief minister of UP. He became associated with the movement soon after taking over the reins of Gorakshpeeth. Now, when the judgment has come, he is the chief minister and the task of getting the temple constructed will rest on his shoulders,” he said.

"Ayodhya verdict: Mature Kerala upholds unity, peace | Kochi News - Times of India","Kerala accepted the Supreme Court’s verdict in the Ayodhya land dispute case in a mature and peaceful manner on Saturday. Muslim organizations in the state were guarded in their response to the verdict. Even while expressing displeasure over the judgment, they urged the people to remain calm. IUML state president Panakkad Syed Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal said the party was honouring the verdict. “The party will make its stand clear after carefully studying the verdict,” he said. Asking people to exercise restraint, Thangal said the party’s stand would be announced after a meeting of its high-power committee at Panakkad on Monday. Samastha Kerala Jam-iyyathul Ulama president Syed Muhammad Jifri Muthukkoya Thangal termed the verdict disappointing. “We accept the judgment,” he said, adding that a decision on moving a review petition would be taken after studying the verdict. Grand Mufti of India Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar also accepted the judgment. “It is not the question of who won or lost, but the unity of the country is of paramount importance,” he said. “Babri Masjid is a place of worship for Muslims, but equally important is that all people live peacefully in India,” he said. Kanthapuram added that no word or deed should come from any individual that would affect communal harmony. Expressing pain over the judgment, PDP chairman Abdul Nasar Madani said his party was exercising the right to express strong disagreement. In a statement issued, he said the court had found that destruction of Babri Masjid was a criminal offence. Jamaát-e-Islami Kerala Amir M I Abdul Azeez said the verdict was painful and disappointing. He expressed hope that the All India Sunni Waqf Board would do everything necessary to find a democratic and legal solution. Popular Front of India (PFI) termed the verdict as ‘unfair and disappointing.’ In a statement PFI general secretary M Muhammad Ali Jinnah said contrary to the facts, the entire land of the demolished Masjid has been handed over for temple construction. “We apprehend that this judgment by the apex court has serious repercussions not only on the minority rights but also on the very foundational principles enshrined in the Indian Constitution” he said. Earlier, several leaders appealed for restraint. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan called for a mature and peaceful response from all sections of the society . Governor Arif Mohammad Khan said the verdict should be accepted by everyone. “Under the Constitutional provision, we all have the responsibility to respect the verdict, honour it and follow it,” he said. Vijayan said the constitutional bench had pronounced the final judgment on an issue, which had triggered bloodshed and riots in our country. “The court has confirmed that installation of Ram idol at the disputed land and the demolition of Babri Masjid were illegal. With this verdict, disputes over the ownership of land has been resolved once and for all,” he said. Recalling that the state had responded sensibly and peacefully when the masjid was demolished, the chief minister said all parties involved should exercise restraint. Echoing similar views, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said he respected the verdict. “Our priority is to ensure peace and calm. Detailed response on the verdict can be shared only after examining the verdict in detail,” he said in Delhi. In Kochi, Justice (retd) B Kemal Pasha said peace and harmony should not be compromised. “Many lives were lost over the Ayodhya dispute. Such incidents should not repeat. There are no winners and losers,” he said. The secretary of Aluva Adwaitha Ashramam, Siva Swaroopananda, said people should act with clarity of thought. “Everyone should uphold the concept of fraternity and live in peace and harmony”. “A chapter has been closed. People should not end up prisoners of their past. The country should move ahead,” said Kochi grand imam M P Fisal Ashari. Fr Vincent Kundukulam of St Joseph Pontifical Seminary, Aluva, said there could be shortcomings in all verdicts. “We are Indians first, and only then comes religion,” he said.

UP Shia Central Waqf Board, another party to the case, also hailed the decision, while stating that the 5 acre land allocated to Sunni Board should have been given to it, but clarified it would not go in for appeal. Welcoming Saturday's verdict, UP Sunni Central Waqf Board chairman, Zufar Faruqi, said if someone else files a review petition, it would not be in Board's name.

 How 1989 ‘Palampur resolution’ vaulted BJP to the centre stage | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In 1989, when BJP adopted the Ram temple demand as part of its political plank, the party argued that Congress and other parties were displaying a callous unconcern regarding the sentiments of an overwhelming majority in the country. “According to all available records, Mughal emperor Babar visited Ayodhya in 1528, destroyed the temple situated at the site believed to be Rama-Janmasthan, and constructed a mosque in its place,” the party said as part of what has came to be known as the “Palampur resolution”. BJP also argued that the conviction that a Ram temple stood at the birthplace of Ram and conflicting claims ould not be settled by a court of law. The party’s decision to adopt VHP’s demand and back the litigation of Hindu parties seeking restoration of the disputed site as a temple proved to a significant decision, which helped it move to political centre-stage and take on the Nehruvian-Left intellectual consensus on “secularism”. The dispute has finally been settled by a court of law, and the party did amend its position on this. But in the meanwhile, it was able to project the Ram temple demand as an “expression of national sentiment” and attacked its opponents as “Babri parties”, a connotation with a polarising undertone that worked electorally. The campaign for the Ram temple proved confrontational, with Hindutva proponents’ claim to the historicity of the Ram Mandir disputed by leading academics, most of them with Left orientation. The demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 put BJP in the doghouse and it failed to attract political partners, despite emerging as the single largest party in 1996. But as it grew, it attracted allies like JD(U) which had a score to settle with RJD. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" Stand vindicated, feel deeply blessed: Advani on SC verdict in Ayodhya case | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: L K Advani, the architect of the political movement for Ram Temple, that catapulted the BJP into the national mainstream in the 1990s, on Saturday said he felt “vindicated and blessed” as he welcomed the Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute that has paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple. With the end of the “Mandir-Masjid dispute,” Advani in a written statement said, “the time has come to leave all contention and acrimony behind and embrace communal concord and peace.” The Babri Mosque demolition on December 6, 1992 had created deep acrimony between the two communities and has since been a part of the political narrative in the country. Advani regretted the demolition of the mosque later, saying it was the “saddest day” in his life. The BJP veteran, who took his party strength in Parliament from “2 to 200” riding the Ram Mandir wave in the 90s along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, welcomed the court’s decision to allot land for the mosque in Ayodhya. “I also welcome the apex court’s decision that five acres of land be given at a prominent place for the building of a mosque in Ayodhya,” he said, adding, “Today’s judgment is the culmination of a long and contentious process that played itself out in various forums – both judicial and non-judicial – in the past many decades. Now that the prolonged Mandir-Masjid dispute in Ayodhya has come to an end, the time has come to leave all contention and acrimony behind and embrace communal concord and peace. Towards this end, I appeal to all sections of our diverse society to work together to strengthen India’s national unity and integrity.” “I join all my countrymen in wholeheartedly welcoming the historic judgement … I stand vindicated, and feel deeply blessed, that the Supreme Court has given its unanimous verdict paving the way for the construction of a magnificent temple for Lord Ram at Ramjanmabhhomi in Ayodhya,” an overwhelmed Advani said. He described the verdict as “a moment of fulfilment because God Almighty had given me an opportunity to make my own humble contribution to the mass movement, the biggest since India’s freedom movement, aimed at the outcome which the Supreme Court’s verdict today has made possible.” He said: “I have always stressed that Ram and Ramayana occupy an esteemed place in India’s cultural and civilizational heritage and Ramjanmabhoomi holds a special and sacred place in the hearts of crores of our countrymen in India and abroad. Therefore, it is gratifying that their belief and sentiments have been respected.” Advani appealed to turn this verdict into a new fulcrum for peace and harmony and said, “In the course of the Ramjanmabhoomi Movement, I had often stated that the true purpose of constructing a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya is to construct a magnificent Rashtra Mandir – building India as a strong, prosperous, peaceful and harmonious nation with justice for all and exclusion of none. Let us rededicate ourselves to that noble mission today.” Senior BJP leader Uma Bharti met Advani at his residence on Saturday and hailed his role in the temple movement as she welcomed the court's order. She said she bowed her head to Advani following the verdict. She also praised late VHP leader Ashok Singhal for spearheading the movement. The former Union minister, a key figure in the saffron agitation, said Advani's devotion to the temple cause is at the root of BJP's success. BJP veteran and Ram temple activist Murli Manohar Joshi, called the Supreme Court's judgment in the case “historic” and said it should be accepted with an “open mind” by all communities.

 BJP's three-decade-long journey from fringes to preeminence riding on Ram Janmabhoomi movement | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court verdict paving the way for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya has brought to the fore the decades-old Ram Janmabhoomi movement which propelled the BJP from the fringes of national politics to becoming a dominant political force as it used the deeply emotive issue to mobilise Hindus. Struggling to find a space in the country's politics dominated by secular parties, the BJP under L K Advani hitched its bandwagon to the temple cause in its Palampur resolution in 1989, giving a defining Hindutva edge to its politics which until then had lacked a popular cause celebre. The issue combined with its alliance with anti-Congress parties in 1989 won the BJP 85 seats in Lok Sabha elections against mere two in 1984. It came to the party's rescue again in 1990 when caste politics, fuelled by the the then VP Singh government's decision to adopt the Mandal Commission report on reservation, began to dominate Indian politics. Advani launched his famous 'Rath Yatra' from Somnath temple in Gujarat, drawing people in their thousands as his chariot rolled through the country's heartland, at times triggering communal riots as well, while the movement gained momentum. The demolition of Babri Masjid at the dispute site on December 6, 1992 made the party a pariah in politics for a while but could not stop its rise to power. Speaking of the movement's role in the BJP's rise, Manindra Nath Thakur, an associate professor at the Centre for Political Studies of JNU, told PTI, ""It played a very important role. It gave a symbol to the BJP to fight elections as it did not have a proper symbol earlier, as the Congress had in the legacy of freedom struggle. Mahatma Gandhi was also a great symbol for the Congress."" The issue gave the BJP ""the symbol of Lord Ram"" which it converted ""into an aggressive plank in organising the Hindu majoritarian politics"", he said. Incidentally, it was the decision to put the issue of temple construction and other core contentious matters like the Uniform Civil Code on the back burner in late 1990s in its quest to win allies to form government at the Centre that halted the BJP's political rise before the Congress ousted it from power in 2004. It took the BJP a full decade to capture the power again after Narendra Modi, then the Gujarat chief minister, combined his aggressive Hindutva image with development plank and catapulted the party to its maiden majority in Lok Sabha in 2014 and then bettering the show in 2019. With the apex court verdict likely to put a closure to decades-old dispute, Arun Anand, a prolific commentator and author of two books on the RSS, said the demand of a Ram temple in Ayodhya is ""unarguably the longest movement in the history of any civilization"". ""The mass movement that started in 1983 not only brought greater awareness about the identity of the nation but also made a huge impact in all spheres of national life. It has created a consensus on the legitimacy of the demand to construct a Ram Temple at Lord Rama's birthplace,"" he said. Hindus had begun agitating to reclaim the land from 1528 before a mass movement restarted in 1983-84, he said, adding that the community fought many battles and sacrificed lives. It will be curious to see as to what turn the BJP's Hindutva politics takes following the verdict, according to political watchers. Thakur cautioned that if the party now takes up the issues of other disputed holy sites like the ones in Mathura and Varanasi, then it will be ""dangerous"" for politics. However, if the judgment leads to the issue's resolution for good and the party moving on to matters like economy, then things may settle. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Ayodhya dispute: SC observation akin to Liberhan Commission finding on demolition | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court, which kept itself away during the Ayodhya land dispute case hearings from going into the issue of demolition of the disputed structure on December 6, 1992, made a passing remark in its judgement on Saturday about the event saying it was brought down in a ""calculated act."" The apex court noted that during the pendency of the lawsuits on the disputed land, ""the entire structure of the mosque was brought down in a calculated act of destroying a place of public worship"". ""The Muslims have been wrongly deprived of a mosque which had been constructed well over 450 years ago,"" a five-judge bench headed by chief justice Ranjan Gogoi noted in its judgement. Though there are few lines in the judgement on the demolition, the observation was reminiscent of the commission of inquiry set up by the then P V Narasimha Rao government within 10 days of the demolition, which also had given the finding that entire demolition was carried out in an ""orchestrated"" manner. The then Congress government had set up a one-man inquiry commission headed by Justice M S Liberhan, who was then the sitting judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. However, Justice Liberhan gave full time to the commission only after his retirement as judge and submitted the report after 17 years during which its term was extended 48 times. He submitted the report in June 2009, during the tenure of Manmohan Singh as the prime minister. After examining the deposition of top leadership of the time including former prime ministers P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, BJP patriarch L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and other leading lights of the Mandir movement, the Liberhan Commission in its report held the then top leadership of BJP and Sangh Parivar (RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal) culpable for the incident of December 6, 1992. Kalyan Singh as the chief minister had given an undertaking to the apex court that no damage would be allowed to be inflicted to the disputed structure by the kar sevaks. The Commission concluded that the factual matrix of the case yields ""indisputable evidence that lured by the prospect of power or wealth, a rank of leaders emerged within the BJP, RSS, VHP, Shiv Sena, Bajrang Dal etc. who were neither guided by any ideology nor imbued with any dogma nor restrained by any moral trepidation"". In his report, Justice Liberhan said the senior police officers were at hand to ensure that their men toed the line and that the demolition of the disputed structure was allowed to go ahead with ""military precision as orchestrated by the leaders present at the spot and carried out by their henchmen."" ""To sum up, December 6, 1992 saw a state of Uttar Pradesh unwilling and unable to uphold the majesty of the law. The ennui flowed from the very office of the chief minister (Kalyan Singh) downwards and infected the state's minions down till the bottom. ""The state had become a willing ally and co-conspirator in the joint common enterprise to announce the revival of a rabid breed of Hindutva, by demolishing the structure they had denounced as a symbol of Islam,"" the commission said.

 Multi-layered security arrangements in place in Ayodhya | India News - Times of India,"AYODHYA: Multi-layered security arrangements have been put in place in the temple town of Ayodhya with drones being used to monitor the situation ahead of the apex court judgment in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case. Be it the area near the Ramjanmabhoomi police station, ""karyashala"" of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas or other parts of the town, policemen could be seen checking two-wheelers. Elaborating on the security arrangements, Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) PV Ramasastry told PTI, ""Adequate forces have been provided to Ayodhya and all sensitive districts of the state in good measure. The force has been sufficiently strengthened in terms of CAPF and PAC companies."" He said not only their number had been increased but the efficiency of the deployed forces was also being improved for the past two months by giving them better equipment and training. Apart from this, senior officers were also involved in planning, he said. When asked whether drone cameras will be used for monitoring purposes, Ramasastry said, ""Drone cameras are being used in the preparatory phase so that the deployment of the forces can be planned correctly."" He said drone cameras would also be used to closely monitor vulnerable spots and rooftops to prevent the accumulation of stones. ""For the past a couple of months, efforts have been made to increase effectiveness and efficiency of the security personnel,"" he said. When asked on the possibility of deploying the NSG, the ADG said, ""Not any. The NSG is available at their bases for any eventuality. We have deployed ATS units, bomb diffusion squads, anti-sabotage and quick response teams."" He informed that for more than a month, police had been trying to build confidence among people. ""Stress has been laid on confidence-building measures,"" he said, adding that police had undertaken patrolling and different sections of society, be it the dharma gurus, traders or academics had been contacted. ""The basic aim of the outreach is to instil a feeling of security,"" he said. Speaking on security arrangements, ADG (Prosecution) Ashutosh Pandey said, ""Sixty companies of the PAC and paramilitary forces have been deployed. As many as 10 drone cameras and CCTVs at 30 crossings have been installed."" Pandey said barricading had been strengthened at the place of the makeshift temple. The entire town had been divided into 31 sectors and 35 sub-sectors, he said, adding that in case there was a surge of visitors, a ""holding area"" had been carved on the outskirts of the town so that people could be sent in batches for the darshan of Lord Ram. Pandey said there was no ban on devotees coming to Ayodhya. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had earlier said two helicopters would be on standby in Lucknow and Ayodhya as part of the security arrangements. Adityanath conveyed this during a late night videoconference with the state's top civil and police officials. Helicopters would be used in case of an emergency, an official said. An official release later said the chief minister reviewed the law and order situation in each district and gave necessary directions to ensure normalcy. It was also decided that a state-level control room will be set up in Lucknow. Every district would have a control room, the release said. Adityanath warned that strict action would be taken against those trying to disturb the law and order. The apex court is likely to deliver its verdict on the Ayodhya title suit before November 17.

Ayodhya verdict date: Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya next week: All you need to know about Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid land dispute | India News - Times of India,"In 1885, a suit seeking permission for constructing a Ram Temple at the disputed site was filed by Mahant Raghubar Das. The trial court rejected it fearing such permission could lead to riots. Appeals too were rejected. In 1934, a mob damaged parts of the disputed structure. The British repaired it. Muslims continued to offer prayer and Hindus worshipped at Ram-Chabutra and Kaushalya Rasoi. On the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949, idol of Lord Ram was surreptitiously placed under the central dome of the disputed structure. Worship by devotees started in a big way from next morning. District authorities, fearing riots, sealed the premises immediately. In 1950, two civil suits were filed — one by G S Visharad of Hindu Mahasabha claiming right to worship and second by Paramhans Ramachandra Das seeking to restrain administration from removing the idols. The trial court allowed worship and restrained the district authorities from removing the idols. The Allahabad high court confirmed the trial court’s interim orders in 1955. In 1959, Nirmohi Akhara filed the third suit seeking right to worship idols under the central dome and handing over of management of the disputed structure to a Hindu Mahant. Sunni Central Wakf Board filed the fourth suit in 1961 seeking removal of idols and possession of the disputed structure, but withdrew it in 1964. It was added as a defendant in the suit filed by Paramhans Ramchandra Das in 1989. The White Paper on Ayodhya brought out by the Congress government led by P V Narasimha Rao in February 1993 said: “The Hindu idols thus continued inside the disputed structure since 1949. Worship of these idols by Hindus also continued without interruption since 1949 and the structure was not used by the Muslims for offering prayers since then.” Another important turn to the roller-coaster journey of Ayodhya dispute took place in 1986, when the Faizabad district court ordered opening of the lock placed on the iron grill gate leading to the central dome of the disputed structure. Many believe the gates were opened at the behest of central government headed by Rajiv Gandhi. Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) was formed and it launched protest movement seeking restoration of disputed structure to Muslims while Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) spearheaded the Hindu organisations and mobilised public for construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site. The title suits pending in Faizabad district court were transferred to Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC in 1989. After December 6, 1992 demolition of Babri Masjid, the Ayodhya case got split into two — one, the title suits pending in Allahabad HC’s Lucknow bench and second, the criminal cases filed against top BJP leaders including L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi for exhorting the Kar Sevaks to raze down the disputed structure. The central government acquired the disputed structure and land surrounding it through a law in January 1993. The Allahabad high court (Lucknow) bench of Justices S U Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and D V Sharma had considered archaeological evidence, which conclusively indicated that Babri Masjid was built on the ruins of an ancient Hindu temple. The HC divided the Ayodhya land equally between three parties — Ram Lalla (idol), Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Wakf Board. The criminal case against BJP leaders too has entered its final phases with the Supreme Court on April 19, 2017 asking the trial court to proceed with the trial, which had been stalled for a long time, and conclude it within two years. While striking down acquisition of 2.77 acres of disputed Ayodhya land, on which the structure before demolition stood, and surrounding 67.703 acres of land, the SC in Ismail Faruqui case [1994 (6) SCC 360] had asked the Centre to act as Receiver of the two tracts of acquired land till final judgement on the title suits. In the 1994 judgment, it had said:“We have no doubt that the moderate Hindu has little taste for the tearing down of the place of worship of another to replace it with a temple. It is our fervent hope that the moderate opinion shall find general expression and that communal brotherhood shall bring to the dispute at Ayodhya an amicable solution long before the courts resolve it.” Here's a look at some important developments in the case over the years:1528: A mosque is built on the site by Mughal emperor Babar which Hindus claim to be the birthplace of Lord Ram and where a temple exited earlier. 1853-1949: Communal violence at site; Britishers give the inner court for Muslims, the outer court for Hindus. 1949: Idol of Lord Ram surfaces inside the mosque, Muslims protest; government proclaims the premises as a disputed area, locks the gates. 1950: Two suits filed in Faizabad civil court for rights to perform pooja of Ram Lalla and keep the idols in the structure; Nirmohi Akhara files third suit in 1959. 1961: UP Sunni Central Wakf Board files a suit demanding posession of site and removal of idols. 1986: District judge orders locks be removed and the site opened for Hindu worshippers. December 6, 1992: Babri Masjid demolished by kar sevaks; Hindu-Muslim violence leaves more than 2,000 people dead. 2001: Special judge drops the charge against 13 accused, including L K Advani and Kalyan Singh. 2002: Train carrying Hindu activists set on fire in Godhra, killing 58 people; riots ensue leaving over 2,000 people dead. 2010: The Allahabad high court awards 2/3rd of the Ayodhya site to Hindu parties and 1/3rd to the Waqf Board. 2011: The Supreme Court stays the Allahabad HC verdict on Ayodhya dispute. 2017: The SC calls for an out of court settlement; restores criminal conspiracy charge against top BJP leaders. 2018: The apex court refuses to refer to a bench the reconsideration of observations in 1994 judgment that mosque was not integral to Islam. March 8, 2019: The SC refers the Ayodhya land dispute case for mediation, asks the panel to complete proceedings within 8 weeks. August 1, 2019: The mediation panel submits its report to the apex court. August 2: The SC says mediation panel fails to find a solution. August 6: The top court begins day-to-day hearing of the case. October 16: After the marathon 40-day daily hearing, the SC concludes hearing in the case.

"UP: Akharas demand security, vow not to react to Ayodhya verdict | Lucknow News - Times of India","LUCKNOW: Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the apex governing body of saints and monastic orders, has decided to hold low-key celebrations if the Ayodhya verdict goes in its favour. The 13 akharas associated with ABAP have also demanded security for mutts, akharas and seers associated with the Ram temple movement. “The decision to hold lowkey celebrations, if the verdict comes in our favour, was taken by akharas in the ABAP meeting held in Haridwar last month. Seers were of the view that grand celebrations by akharas could lead to aggressive celebrations by public. People may give inflammatory speeches or resort to celebrations may disrupt harmony. This could lead to a law and order problem which we do not want,” said Narendra Giri, the mahant (chief priest) of Baghambari mutt and Niranjani akhara, one of the 13 akharas associated with ABAP. “Akhara parishad will go by the decision taken at the Haridwar meet to ensure that no wrong message goes to the public. We helped maintain peace when the Allahabad high court gave its verdict on Ayodhya dispute in 2010 and we are doing the same this time too. Parishad is not against celebrations, but they should not disrupt peace,” said Juna Akhara general secretary Harigiri Earlier this week, an ABAP delegation led by Mahant Narendra Giri met ADG Allahabad zone Sujeet Pandey and sought security for mutts, akharas and seers associated with the Ram temple movement. “The atmosphere is tense, so we have demanded security to maintain communal harmony. A similar request has also been sent to the CM’s office,” Giri told TOI. ABAP had been organizing the annual “Sanatan Sammelan” (seers’ convention) for the past many years in Allahabad to press the central government to bring a bill in Parliament for the construction of Ram temple.

" Ayodhya D-day: Centre sends paramilitary forces to UP, RPF steps up vigil, cancels leave | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI/AYODHYA: The Centre has rushed around 4,000 paramilitary personnel to Uttar Pradesh while the Railway police cancelled leave of its force and stepped up vigil at 78 major stations and on trains as part of its security preparedness ahead of Supreme Court's Ayodhya verdict expected next week. As the ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Thursday sent a general advisory to all the states and Union territories asking them to deploy adequate security personnel at all sensitive places, political leaders made fresh calls to people not to indulge in making provocative remarks or spreading rumours. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday discussed the Ayodhya issue with his council of ministers and asked them to refrain from making unnecessary statements on the subject and maintain harmony in the country, according to sources. The apex court is likely to deliver its verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case before Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi retires on November 17. Justice Gogoi headed the 5-judge Constitution bench that heard the case for several weeks. As part of goodwill measures, meetings were being held by police with members of Hindu and Muslim communities with an appeal to them to maintain calm. ""All of them have agreed to abide and respect the judgment,"" Bengaluru Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao told reporters. An MHA official in Delhi said the ministry has rushed 40 companies of paramilitary forces to Uttar Pradesh to assist the state government in maintaining law and order, particularly in Ayodhya. A company of paramilitary forces comprises about 100 personnel. Ayodhya is also expected to see a heavy rush of pilgrims next week over Karthik Purnima as the local administration gears up to ensure calm. Lakhs of devotees are expected to gather in the pilgrim town on November 12 for Karthik Purnima Snan. As the locals keep fingers crossed, they hope there won't be any trouble after the verdict. Outstation patients at Dr Banerjee's clinic ask him to prescribe extra medicines in the event of any trouble after the verdict. Dr Indroneel Banerjee said he tells them to have faith. “All is well. And God willing, all will be well in future as well.” ""The atmosphere is by and large normal. People are feeling a bit apprehensive, but they are not afraid,” he told PTI. “People in Ayodhya, whether they are Hindus or Muslims, want peace and development in the city. People of the temple city, Hindus and Muslims, are sure there will be no clashes between them,” he said. The railway police issued a seven-page advisory to all its zones giving them a slew of instructions on security preparedness, sources said. The advisory from the Railway Protection Force (RPF) said leaves of all its personnel have been cancelled and they have been instructed to be engaged in escorting trains. The advisory, which covers aspects like security at platforms, railway stations, yard, parking space, bridges and tunnels as well as production units and workshops, has earmarked all potential hot-spots which could either be a site for any violence or could be used to hide explosives. The RPF advisory said a close watch should be kept on all religious structures near railway stations or within its premises as they may become ""flash points"" in case tempers run high. It has also instructed caretakers of such structures not to leave them unguarded. It has identified around 78 major stations with high footfall including stations in Mumbai, Delhi, Maharashtra and UP where the presence of RPF personnel have been increased. The advisory also rescinded an earlier order which allowed stations to keep their lighting to around 30 per cent to save electricity when there is no train at the station, instructing all zones to keep lighting at 100 per cent at all times instead. The advisory has also issued strict operational guidelines to be followed in case a mob is sighted in railway premises - presence of quick response teams, sealing of entry and exit points and use of CCTV cameras monitored by skilled personnel - to maximise security of railway premises. It also asked zones to ensure there is no leakage of information about VVIP or military movement during this time. At other stations too, the visible presence of RPF personnel have been made. All zones have been asked to repair their baggage scanners, CCTV cameras and keep a constant watch on crowded areas like lobbies and waiting areas. Zones have also been asked to conduct anti-sabotage drives of all empty rakes which should be locked and secured after the operations as they can be used as hiding places for anti-social elements. ""The decision of the judiciary is paramount. I would like to urge the public that people should not indulge in any provocation and social harmony should not be disturbed,"" Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot told reporters in Jaipur. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), meanwhile, has stopped stone carving work for the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya for the first time since 1990. All the artisans involved in the work have returned to their homes, said VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma.

A series of meetings have been held in the city in recent days where participants unanimously resolved that communal harmony would be maintained whatever the verdict on the Ramjanmabhoomi and Babri Masjid dispute. ""India's highest court is set to give its verdict on the issue, which has been lingering for decades. Both Hindus and Muslims must accept the SC order gracefully. There should not be victory celebrations or protests if the verdict is against another party,"" Congress politician and former minister Arif Naseem Khan, who attended a meeting of community leaders with police officers in Ghatkopar, said.

"Ayodhya verdict: Some shift out, others stocking up on ration | India News - Times of India","AYODHYA: In Ayodhya these days, the air is thick with apprehension and anxiety. With the temple verdict expected any day now, the town’s residents are making whatever preparations they can — some are hoarding food and essentials, while others have quietly begun shifting women and children out to places they feel are safe. Some are even cancelling weddings or moving venues outside the district. A middle-aged tailor in Syedwada, a neighbourhood with a considerable number of Muslim families living alongside temples and Hindu households, said, “They (locals residents) talk among themselves and say that Syedwada will be targeted this time. It is worrisome.” The man, who didn’t want to give out his name, added, “They are saying there will be trouble if the judgment is not in favour of the Ram temple. What will we do in such a situation if not send our families away?” Many in the community had done the same when in November last year VHP and Shiv Sena members descended on the town. Some distance away, Ghanshyam Gupta, whose family has been selling ladoos outside the famous Hanuman Garhi temple for three generations, said, “We have made suitable arrangements and are stocking rice and lentils at home.” Umar Farooq, a litigant in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, said he’s seen it all — the violence in 1990, the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 and the arson that followed, the tension around the high court judgment of 2010, and when the Shiv Sena marched into Ayodhya in November last year. “Through all this, Ayodhya residents never had problems with one another. Trouble starts when a mob comes from outside. That’s when there is chaos for us,” he added. The district administration, meanwhile, is holding peace gatherings with community leaders and is even forming WhatsApp groups for real-time communication and deployment of additional forces in the event of an emergency. District magistrate Anuj K Jha told TOI that a number of meetings in October and November with Hindu mahants and Muslim imams had been held to address worries and give assurances of safety. “We have assured Muslims that a survey of all sensitive areas, including minority-dominant ones and those with mixed populations, has already been done and we will be deploying forces ahead of the verdict. There is no need for people to panic. Our focus is peace and protection in the whole of Ayodhya,” Jha said. However, apprehension is still running deep. In October, the Muslim community’s nervousness became apparent when a meeting was called at the house of Haji Mahboob, another litigant in the dispute, to get their concerns addressed. “Security was beefed up in Ayodhya in 2010 when the high court was to pronounce a judgment. Things will be fine if there is a similar bandobast in place. But people are scared. Many haven’t been able to forget 1992.” He has a point. Syed Khalique Ahmed’s son was to get married in December. But feeling that the situation is “not conducive” for a celebration, Ahmed not just changed the venue of the wedding from Faizabad to Lucknow but also got his son married in early November itself. Hotel owners in Ayodhya echoed Ahmed’s sentiment. Pawan Singh, manager of the Birla Dharmashala, meters away from Hanuman Garhi, said, “People have cancelled bookings for venues and rooms, not just for November and December but until February next year. Whoever is saying normal life in Ayodhya has not been disrupted is not telling the truth.” In Video:Security tightened in Ayodhya ahead of SC verdictDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

The Ayodhya case is not merely a case of land dispute, but a test case of the supremacy of the law, he was quoted as saying by a statement issued by Jamiat. ""Every justice-loving person wants the case should be adjudicated on the basis of hard facts and evidence, not on the basis of faith and belief,"" he said, adding that the Supreme Court has also stated that it is a title suit case only. ""We reiterate our old stand that whatever the judgment Supreme Court will deliver on the basis of facts and evidence, we will accept it and we also appeal to Muslims and fellow citizens to respect the SC judgment,"" he said.

The Sangh's top brass in its recent meeting of 'pracharaks' had told them not to celebrate or carry out processions if the Ram temple judgment comes in its favour. A five-judge constitution bench led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi reserved its judgment in the Ayodhya land dispute case on October 16 after a marathon 40-day daily hearing. The verdict is expected before Justice Gogoi retires on November 17. In his last edition of 'Mann ki Baat' on October 27, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recalled how the government, political parties and civil society prevented attempts to create fissures when the 2010 Allahabad High Court ruling on the disputed land in Ayodhya was to be delivered. The PM described it as an example of how a united voice could strengthen the country. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Narasimha Rao rejected MHA report on Ayodhya in 1992: Ex-home secy | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Babri Masjid could have been saved if there was political will to act and the then Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao did not accept a comprehensive contingency plan of the Home Ministry prepared before the demolition, claims Madhav Godbole who was the Union home secretary that time. “If political initiative had been taken at the prime minister's level, the Mahabharata of this Ramayana could have been avoided,” he says in his new book on the Ayodhya dispute. Seeking to draw a cogent picture of the events which transpired during the critical period before and after the demolition, Godbole says as prime minister, Rao “played the most important role in this crucial test match, but, unfortunately, he turned out to be a non-playing captain”. In “The Babri Masjid-Ram Mandir Dilemma: An Acid Test for India's Constitution”, the author claims that besides Rao, former prime ministers Rajiv Gandhi and V P Singh also failed to take timely action when the mosque was under serious threat. He says that when Rajiv Gandhi was prime minister, some workable compromise solutions were suggested to resolve the dispute, before positions had hardened on either side but no steps were taken. V P Singh remained firm after promulgating an ordinance vesting the specified area in and around the Babri Masjid in the central government, he says. In 1992, after detailed discussions with institutions and officers concerned, Godbole says the Ministry of Home Affairs prepared a comprehensive contingency plan for the takeover of the structure by invoking Article 356 of the Constitution. The ministry of law had also cleared the Cabinet note for this purpose, he adds. He “submitted the contingency plan” to the Cabinet Secretary, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, Senior Advisor to Prime Minister, home minister and the Prime Minister on November 4. It was emphasised therein that in order for the central paramilitary forces to successfully take over the Babri Mosque and the surrounding area to ensure its security, timing and the element of surprise were of essence, Godbole recalls. “For this purpose, it was underlined that action would have to e taken well before the proposed date of commencement of ‘kar seva' so as to avoid the presence of large number of ‘kar sevaks' and huge crowds at the time of action,” he writes in the book, brought out by Konark Publishers. It was also highlighted that imposition of President's Rule under Article 356 would be necessary before the central forces commenced their action, he says. But Rao felt the contingency plan was not workable and dismissed it, he says. “Rao held a different view regarding the powers of the central government under the Constitution and preferred to rely on the promises made and commitments given by the state government to the central government, the National Integration Council (NIC) and the Supreme Court,” Godbole says. As a result, the author says, the “Kalyan Singh government was left free to deal with the situation. Not surprisingly, it permitted the kar sevaks to take the law into their own hands and to destroy the masjid. It was a clear case of the state government failing in its responsibilities under the Constitution”. But it was not just the central government which failed in its obligations to act, other institutions under the Constitution also failed, Godbole asserts. “The founding fathers of the Constitution could not have visualised such all-round failure of governance and non-observance of constitutional precepts and values. Clearly, India had made a mockery of its Constitution. The worst culprit was the state government which deliberately and consciously failed to fulfil its commitments to safeguard the structure,” he says. The former home secretary also blames the then governor of Uttar Pradesh B Satya Narayan Reddy for “failing miserably in assessing the seriousness of the situation in the state and advising the Centre against imposition of President's Rule”. Finally, the judiciary too was responsible in delaying the decision in the title suits pending before it since 1950, in spite of repeated pleas by the parties for expediting the hearings, he says. He is also of the view that intermixing religion and politics has added fuel to the fire. After the demolition of the mosque, Godbole took voluntary retirement from the Indian Administrative Service in March 1993 when he was Union home secretary and Secretary, Justice.

" Respect SC judgment, say mosques across UP | India News - Times of India","AYODHYA/LUCKNOW: Mosques across Uttar Pradesh on Friday made an ‘elaan’ (announcement) for peace and brotherhood, and for respecting the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya dispute due by the 17 th of this month. “Avoid any slogans, celebrations or complaints, and exhort national integration so that the country’s harmony is undisturbed,” was the collective message delivered to millions of Muslims in the state. In Lucknow, Imam of Aishbagh Eidgah and executive member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali made an emphatic appeal to this effect in his address before Friday prayers. Mosques in Ayodhya and adjoining Faizabad also made appeals for peace. “There should be no outward celebrations or expression of remorse, sloganeering or such activities that hurt the religious sentiments of other communities after the verdict,” declared Mahali. “When the SC decides, we should all remember that the decision has been made by the highest court of law, and it should be respected by each one of us,” he added at the Eidgah in a room full of namazis. He also asked the youth to bust the myths about Islam on social media and appealed to all to hold national unity above all. “The current Islamic month of Rabi-ul-Awwal is Prophet Muhammad’s birth month. The Prophet made clear that Islam spreads love, harmony and brotherhood among all creations of Allah. He asked us to stay away from animosity. This is the time we prove with our actions that Islam is indeed a religion of peace,” said the cleric. Disseminating his appeal through social media, Mahali said, “To maintain peace is the responsibility of all and it has been a positive step that Hindu organisations like RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad have also asked for the same. The gesture is not limited to one community but has to be reciprocated. It is not a time to be fearful but to repose all trust in the country’s justice system.” Similar appeals, he confirmed to TOI, were made at mosques in Sitapur, Kanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Lakhimpur, Bahraich, Gorakhpur, Leherpur and other places. At Ayodhya’s Kotiya Masjid, Imam Ishtiaq Ahmed addressed devotees. “Everyone was asked to maintain calm in Ayodhya and accept the apex court’s verdict. No event should be given a communal colour,” said Babri Masjid litigant Iqbal Ansari, who was present at Kotiya mosque. Another litigant, Mohammad Umar, who attended prayers at Kewda Masjid of Ayodhya, said: “We were assured by the administration in a meeting on Wednesday that adequate security is present and there will be no breach of peace. We decided to share that assurance with our brethren, who were worried that mob from outside of Ayodhya will ruin peace here.” “The chief Imam told everyone to not be scared or leave the city but to respect the SC’s verdict,” he added. Even at political levels, efforts were made in Ayodhya for peace by holding peace meetings with influential locals. Such meetings were held by Peace Party on Thursday and Samajwadi Party on Friday.

UP government braces for big law &amp; order challenge as verdict day nears | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: As the verdict day for the Ayodhya dispute nears, UP government faces a big challenge on the law and order front. The government is aware of the ramifications of the verdict, which could prove to be a severe threat to the socio-political fabric even beyond the temple town of Ayodhya and Lucknow or UP. For the government, there are two models — of the Kalyan Singh government in 1992 and the Mayawati government in 2010 to face the situation in Ayodhya and the state in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment. In 1992, when the BJP had formed its first majority government in UP riding on the crest of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement, then CM Kalyan Singh had ordered that no force would be used against karsewaks heading for Ayodhya for “karsewa” at the disputed site. He had also issued orders of not deploying Central paramilitary forces in Ayodhya and ordered their stationing only on the fringes of the temple town. Facing no deterrence or any obstacle, thousands of frenzied karsewaks carrying “trishuls” in their hands and armed with spade and sickles, demolished the Babri Masjid triggering riots in many parts of the country on December 2, 1992. In the Mayawati government, when the first verdict on the centuries-old dispute was to be pronounced in November 2010, she ordered that “not even a bird should flutter its wings.” The state was virtually taken over by central paramilitary forces and communally-sensitive lanes and bylanes crowded with police and para military forces. Not a single stone was pelted, after the judgment, which was peacefully challenged in the Supreme Court. On October 30, 1990, November 2, 1990 and December 2, 1992, the clashes between police and karsewaks in the Mulayam government in 1990 and then in the Kalyan government, regions in and around Ayodhya had plunged into the communal cauldron. However, this time, CM Yogi Adityanath has started working on a contingency plan to avoid the repeat of 1992 nightmare at any cost. Additional chief secretary (home) Awneesh Awasthi told TOI that the state government has already sent its requisition to the Centre for central paramilitary forces while the PAC has already been deployed in large numbers in Ayodhya. The movement of people reaching Ayodhya from all over is already under scanner and Section 144 imposed to deter people from any celebrations or congregations in the wake of SC judgment, said Awasthi, adding that to ensure adequate manpower of police, para military and government staff, the decision of cancelling their leave till November 30 has already been implemented.

Ayodhya dispute: Muslim parties’ lawyers junk ‘compromise’ pact | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Five lawyers representing different organisations and individuals of Muslim side in the Ayodhya title suit, on Friday objected to the mediation panel’s report submitted to Supreme Court earlier on Wednesday, which claimed Muslim parties were ready to drop their claim. The lawyers, in a strongly worded statement issued to the press alleged the “compromise” proposal in the panel’s report was unacceptable and was also leaked to the media by either the mediation panel or Nirvani Akhara and other “limited participants” in the talks, in violation of apex court’s confidentiality clause in the mediation process. “We the appellants before Supreme Court don’t accept the proposal nor the procedure of mediation or the manner in which a withdrawal of claim has been suggested as a compromise,” said the statement on behalf of Muslim parties on Friday. It also put on record that “recent attempts before mediation committee were not representative” in nature. Issued by senior advocates on record for Muslims, Ejaz Maqbool, Shakil Ahmed Syed, MR Shamshad, Irshad Ahmad and Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, the statement hints at a “well thought-out” conspiracy to leak the mediation panel report on the day the apex court closed hearing in the Ayodhya case. Claiming to have been “taken aback by media reports of UP Sunni Central Waqf Board willing to withdraw its claim on disputed site,” lawyers said only limited persons attended the second mediation which began while the court was hearing the matter. “Only limited persons, including Dharam Das of Nirvani Akhara, Zufar Faruqui of Sunni Central Waqf Board and Chakrapani of Hindu Mahasabha attended the mediation. Two others may have also been part of the process,” read the statement. Talking to TOI, senior lawyer on the Muslim side, Ejaz Maqbool, said, “The leak may have been inspired by either the mediation committee or those who participated in the proceedings. When this second round of mediation began, a letter was sent to both Hindu and Muslim parties and both rejected the second attempt to mediate. Hindu parties stated they were not ready for any settlement and other Muslim appellants made it clear there was no possibility of a mediation again after the first attempt failed.” The statement also makes a “pertinent note” of alleged communications between senior advocate and mediation committee member, Sriram Panchu, and chairperson of the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, Zufar Faruqui. “Panchu had sent a communication to Chief Justice of India that protection be granted to Faruqui and the UP government was directed to make arrangements. On October 16, while the case was being heard, a further communication was received from Panchu on behalf of mediation committee, which was not disclosed,” states the official statement. The lawyers on behalf of the Muslim appellants have also claimed Panchu was in the Supreme Court premises and communicating with Zufar Faruqui on October 16, on last day of Ayodhya case hearing. The three-member court appointed mediation panel, including advocate Sri Ram Panchu, spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and former Justice FM Kalifulla had on Wednesday informed SC of a settlement under which Muslim parties agreed to withdraw their claim to Ayodhya land for construction of the Ram temple. The points of settlement included strict implementation of Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act of 1991 to maintain status quo for all places of worship that existed on August 15, 1947, repair of all other mosques in Ayodhya and construction of a mosque at an alternative site by the waqf board.

" Need Ayodhya settlement, not judgment: Sunni Waqf Board lawyer | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: A representative of the UP Sunni Waqf Board said some of the parties involved in the Ayodhya title dispute have reached a settlement, which will ensure a ""win-win situation for both sides and there will not be any need for judgment"". Advocate Shahid Rizvi, speaking on behalf of Waqf Board chairman Zufar Ahmad Farooqui, said: ""The terms of settlement are such that no party will be disappointed, and we urge the other parties (Ram Lalla Virajman and Nirmohi Akhara) to shun differences and join us in resolving this age-old dispute."" The Board is one of the most prominent stakeholder in the case from the Muslim side. There are also other Muslim parties involved in the case including appeals filed in personal capacity. Ram Lalla and the Nirmohi Akhara did not participate in the second round of mediation after the first round failed to ensure parties in reaching an amicable resolution. The apex court began daily hearing in the case on August 6. The second round of mediation was initiated at the behest of Muslim parties, in the middle of September, and the top court had given its approval on continuation on the process of mediation. Rizvi insisted that the dispute of this nature does not need a judgment, and that a settlement is the best resolution. However, counsel representing the Board in the top court has refused to comment on the nature of settlement, and have gone on record saying they are not in the know-how of any settlement. Two appeals were been filed by the Board in 2011 -- the main lawsuit and the Ram Lalla lawsuit. Rizvi said the court-appointed mediation panel had filed a report in the apex court based on terms and conditions on which the parties agreed. The report was filed in the court on Wednesday morning. He, however, refused to divulge the details on the nature of terms and conditions agreed between the parties which include the Waqf Board, Nirvani Akhara and three other Hindu parties. He also refused to comment if the Board has expressed willingness to part with the Babri Masjid area in exchange for any other site in Ayodhya. "" The mediation panel has made tremendous achievement by coming out with a resolution. Now, the apex court will decide on the mutual settlement filed on court's direction,"" added Rizvi. However, the Nirmohi Akhara has rubbished the claims on mediation. ""Why were they (the Waqf Board) waiting for the judgement to be reserved. They should have come to the court and agreed for the title of dispute site in favour of us,"" its spokesman Kartick Chopra, said. Citing the legal channel of settlement before the judgement, Rizvi said there is a provision in civil cases where parties can settle the matter even after the judgement has been reserved. ""Everybody wants to settle the matter. Moreover, it is not one-sided settlement,"" he added. A five-judge of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, had on Wednesday reserved its judgment in the case after a marathon 40-day hearing.

Ayodhya verdict: Will mediation finally resolve the Ayodhya land dispute? | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Even as the Supreme Court reserved its verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute till November 17 on the last day of the day-to-day hearings, there're indications that the 70 years old case might finally get resolved through a mediation formula. It remains to be seen whether the court goes with the mediation settlement or comes up with its own verdict. Encore, once moreThe once-failed mediation following which the SC stepped in to solve the dispute from August, seems to have got a second lease of life, with the SC-appointed mediation panel — comprising former Judge of SC F M I Kalifulla, senior advocate Sriram Panchu and spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravishankar — filing a settlement between the warring Hindu and Muslim parties. According to the terms of the settlement, Sunni Wakf Board will give up its claim on the disputed 2.77 acre land in lieu of which the government will do restoration work at 52 mosques in Ayodhya; the Wakf Board will construct another mosque at an alternative site; implementation of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 that prohibits ""conversion of any place of worship and to provide for the maintenance of the religious character of any place of worship as it existed"" on August 15, 1947 (the Act exempts Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute from its purview); and opening of select few mosques under ASI control for offering of namaz.

Even though the VHP-backed Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas did not participate in the mediation, the settlement is in line with their objectives — that of building a Ram temple at the disputed site. On the Muslim side, one of the parties — the Jamiat Ulema — is also not a signatory to the settlement. However, it's the Sunni Wakf Board which has ownership of the land.

Appearing for Hindu Mahasabha, senior advocate Vikas Singh was showing a map claiming to locate where Lord Ram is believed to have been born at the disputed site in Ayodhya.

" Ayodhya case: SC concludes hearing in Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute, reserves order | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday concluded hearing in the politically sensitive case of Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute in Ayodhya and reserved the judgment. The bench heard for 40 days the arguments of the Hindu and the Muslim sides. SC concludes hearing in Ayodhya dispute; here's how case unfolded over the yearsA 5-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, granted three days to contesting parties to file written notes on 'moulding of relief' or narrowing down the issues on which the court is required to adjudicate. The other members of the bench are justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer. The protracted hearing in the Ayodhya dispute had entered the crucial final leg on October 14 when the apex court resumed proceedings on the 38th day after the week-long Dussehra break. 'Enough is enough': Ayodhya hearing to end today at 5pm, CJI saysThe Constitution bench, which started the day-to-day proceedings on August 6 after mediation proceedings failed to find an amicable solution to the vexatious dispute, had revised the deadline for wrapping up the proceedings. Fourteen appeals have been filed in the apex court against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment, delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land in Ayodhya be partitioned equally among the three parties -- the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla. Initially, as many as five lawsuits were filed in the lower court. The first one was filed by Gopal Singh Visharad, a devotee of ''Ram Lalla'', in 1950 to seek enforcement of the right to worship of Hindus at the disputed site. In the same year, the Paramahansa Ramachandra Das had also filed the lawsuit for continuation of worship and keeping the idols under the central dome of the now-demolished disputed structure. The plea was later withdrawn. Later, the Nirmohi Akahara also moved the trial court in 1959 seeking management and ''shebaiti'' (devotee) rights over the 2.77 acre disputed land. Then came the lawsuit of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Wakf Board which moved the court in 1961, claiming title right over the disputed property. The deity, ''Ram Lalla Virajman'' through next friend and former Allahabad High Court judge Deoki Nandan Agrawal, and the Janambhoomi (the birthplace) moved the lawsuit in 1989, seeking title right over the entire disputed property on the key ground that the land itself has the character of the deity and of a ''Juristic entity''. Later, all the lawsuits were transferred to the Allahabad High Court for adjudication following the demolition of the disputed Ram Janambhoomi-Babri masjid structure on December 6, 1992, sparking communal riots in the country. Earlier, the bench had said it would wrap up the hearing by October 17, a day sooner than the earlier schedule. Fixing the schedule for the final leg of the lengthy arguments, it had said that the Muslim side would complete the arguments on October 14 and thereafter, two days would be granted to the Hindu parties to sum up their rejoinders by October 16. The judgment in the matter is to be pronounced by November 17, the day the Chief Justice of India will demit the office. The apex court had on August 6 commenced day-to-day proceedings in the case as the mediation proceedings initiated to find the amicable resolution had failed. It had taken note of the report of the three-member panel, comprising Justice FMI Kallifulla, spiritual guru and founder of the Art of Living foundation Sri Sri Ravishankar and senior advocate and renowned mediator Sriram Panchu, that mediation proceedings, which went on for about four months, did not result in any final settlement and it had to decide the matter pending before it.

 Muslim parties ask SC: Why all questions directed at us? | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: After 38 days of arguments on cross-appeals for ownership of the 2.77 acre Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid disputed land in Ayodhya, the Muslim parties suggested there was a bias against them by telling the Supreme Court that the five-judge bench had directed all questions at them while none were put to Hindu parties. With three more days to go before arguments conclude, a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer raised questions on the claim of Muslim parties for full ownership over the disputed land as they argued that Hindu parties had never sought ownership over the mosque from 1885 till 1989, when the deity through next friend filed a suit. Justice Chandrachud asked what was the implication of Hindus continuously worshipping in the mosque’s outer courtyard and whether it would amount to Muslim parties ceding ownership right. Appearing for Muslim parties, advocate Rajeev Dhavan argued that Hindus were given only prescriptive right to worship in the outer courtyard and that could never amount to ceding title of any part of the mosque to them. When the judge put another question about iron railings being erected inside the mosque to segregate worship areas of Hindus and Muslims, an irked Dhavan said, “What I like about this hearing is that all questions are directed at us (Muslim parties) and none to them (Hindu parties).” Taken aback, Justice Chandrachud said Dhavan’s remark was “completely unwarranted”. But Dhavan retorted, “It is not unwarranted though I am duty bound to answer the questions put by the bench.” Dhavan may not have been correct in casting aspersions at the bench as the judges had repeatedly questioned propositions and arguments of advocates K Parasaran, C S Vaidyanathan and P N Mishra, who appeared for Hindu parties, and advocate Sushil Jain, who appeared for Nirmohi Akhara.

 Muslim Personal Board optimistic of SC ruling in Babri Masjid favour | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Saturday expressed optimism about the Supreme Court's judgment in favour of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya claiming such ""a judgment for Muslim cause will be based on right, fair play and justice."" The board, which held its working committee meeting at Lucknow's Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama on the day, also reiterated its stance that land dedicated to a mosque cannot be altered, changed or transferred in any manner as it is not permitted under Shariat. Holding the meeting under the chairmanship of Maulana Rabey Hasani Nadwi, the board further clarified that while no Muslim can surrender or transfer such a waqf land, the submission of Muslims is based on historical facts and evidence that Babri Masjid was constructed without demolishing any temple or any other place of worship. ""Several proposals were mooted for mediation in the Ayodhya dispute and AIMPLB participated in those completely. But it is clear now that there is no possibility of mediation or reconciliation. Since legal proceedings are in the final stage, there is no possibility of any mediation now,"" said the press statement issued by the board after its day-long meeting in Lucknow. Expressing satisfaction on the way facts from the Muslim side were presented in court by all of the counsels, the board expressed its optimism towards a favourable court verdict. ""The AIMPLB expressed its optimism that the SC will pronounce judgment in favour of Muslim cause which will be based on right, fair play and justice,"" the official statement said. It also said that the Ayodhya dispute is a test case for basic values of secularism enshrined in the Constitution. ""Ultimate judgment of the apex court will align with the rule of law and basic value of the Constitution,"" the board said. The working committee also held deliberations on Uniform Civil Code (UCC) calling the concept a ""threat to diversity."" ""Any attempts made to destroy this diversity either through court or legislative measures, it will be the board's duty to oppose it democratically and peacefully,"" the board said. Not only will UCC affect Muslims, the board said, but also the cultural and social rights of tribals and other religious minorities. ""The board demands that the courts of the day whether central or provincial should abstain from this anti-national activity,"" it said. The members also decided to challenge the constitutionality of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriages) Act 2019. Far from protecting rights of Muslim women and children in marriage, the board claimed, the Act will destroy marriages and render the Muslim women destitute.

 We should hand over Ayodhya disputed land as goodwill gesture: Muslim intellectuals | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: A group of Muslim intellectuals under the banner of ""Indian Muslims for Peace"" on Thursday said that, as a ""goodwill gesture"" majority of Muslims are ready to hand over the disputed 2.77 acres of land in Ayodhya to the Indian government. The forum which admitted it had no stake in the Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute and that it had not involved any other litigant of the case in its discussions except the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, will now submit its resolution to the Ayodhya mediation panel. Addressing a press conference in Lucknow with former Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) vice chancellor, general Zameeruddin Shah, as its chief guest, the group said that, the Supreme Court (SC) should give a clear verdict in the matter. It also said that for communal harmony of the country, Muslims should give up claim to the land where Babri Masjid once stood. ""In our collective wisdom, the disputed land owned by Muslims of India may be handed over by the Supreme Court of India to the government of India as a goodwill gesture for attaining communal harmony and long lasting peace in the country,"" read the resolution. ""We have no stake in the matter, but we hope that as a pressure group of Muslims, the Muslim litigants at the helm of the dispute, will see sense in our proposal and accept it as a whole. I was not part of this group, but only got involved when the Sunni Waqf board invited me to be so,"" Zameeruddin Shah told TOI on the sidelines of the presser. ""For the past one and a half years attempts are being made to resolve this matter through mediation. This is our last attempt to end the matter in the name of peace and communal harmony. This is why the intelligentsia of the community including doctors, academia, lawyers, army men, bureaucrats and journalists have come together,"" said former IAS Anis Ansari, while addressing the media. While the forum said the land should be handed over to Indian government, as custodian of the land ever since after Babar's rule and because it is already the custodian of 67 acres of surrounding land, it also raised four points of Muslim interest, as riders to the proposal. These included that the status of no other Muslim or any other place of worship will be disturbed as of August 15, 1947. While this is already provided for under the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act of 1991, the forum asked for the three month punishment under the Act to be extended to a minimum three years and a maximum of a life sentence. The forum also said that mosques and mausoleums protected under ASI should be made open for religious activities and worship. And lastly that the criminal conspiracy case for demolition of Babri Masjid should be expedited and victims of riots brought to justice at the earliest. ""We agree that without participation of litigants and out of court settlement is nothing. Even then, there are a majority of Muslims who want reconciliation. The SC hearing can go on, we have no qualms, but it is better to find a way among ourselves so that no harm is brought to the secular fabric of the country,"" added Ansari. ""Even if the judgment is in the mosque's favour, there is no way a mosque can be built at the site where there is a functional temple already. Forcing something will only lead to clashes and riots. So this is not out of fear or abject surrender, but for country's peace we are offering a solution,"" said Kausar Usman. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Ayodhya dispute: Hindu sides in SC rebut Muslim claims over the site | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Hindu parties asserted in the Supreme Court on Thursday that claims of the Muslim side over the 2.77-acre-land in the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute are belied from the excavated materials that suggest existence of a ""massive structure"" beneath the demolished mosque. The counsel for deity Ram Lalla said the excavated materials are a ""proof beyond doubt"" about the existence of the structure beneath the demolished mosque in Ayodhya while rebutting the claim of Muslim parties about the existence of an Islamic structure. The counsel stated that from the pillar bases, artefacts, circular shrine, intersecting brickbat walls found in excavation, an inference can be drawn that the massive structure was a temple and not any Islamic structure. A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi was told by Senior Advocate C S Vaidyanathan, appearing for deity Ram Lalla, that the contention of the Muslim parties about a structure beneath the disputed site being an idgah wall or an Islamic structure was not correct. ""First their case was that there was no structure at all. Secondly, they said it was an Islamic structure or an idgah wall. We say that it was a temple which was demolished and the pillar bases found during excavation also suggest to this effect,"" Vaidyanathan said in his rejoinder arguments. ""That there was a massive structure beneath is a proof beyond doubt,"" he said. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for Muslim parties, said that as per the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report there is no conclusive proof or findings of destruction of a temple. ""There is no finding in the ASI report that there was a destruction of a structure. There is no proof of destruction at all in the ASI report,"" he said. Vaidyanathan told the bench, also comprising Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, that it is the case of Hindu parties that inference can be drawn from the excavated materials which include circular shrines, pillar bases, artefacts, intersecting brick bat walls and others that it was a temple. ""The walls found in the excavation are not ordinary walls. There is an indication of massive structure which was a public place. It was not a private residence. In the conclusion ASI has drawn, they have suggested existence of a massive structure and taking all this into account, it seems to be a nature of a temple,"" he said, adding that it was a place of significance for Hindus, who worshipped there for centuries. At the outset, Vaidyanathan said that intersecting walls have inscriptions of some Shlokas and Makar Paranala which is considered as vehicle of Goddess Ganga. ""These are some features in the walls of a traditional Hindu temple built between 10 and 11th century,"" he said, adding that even the pillar bases found during excavation show that the claims of Muslim parties that it was an Islamic structure was only a conjecture. He said the reasonable inference drawn is that it is the faith and belief that there was a Hindu temple. Interrupting Vaidyanathan, the bench said that faith and belief about the Hindus cannot be disputed but now in evidence, what is there to establish the existence of temple. The 36th day of hearing also saw the top court restraining the Hindu parties from placing or relying on any new materials saying it won't allow at this stage to place any new evidences. ""Just because a five-judge Constitution bench is sitting you cannot bring any new materials at this stage. The constitution bench is hearing this case because of the importance and sensitivity of the matter,"" the bench told senior advocate P N Mishra, appearing for one of the Hindu parties, who tried to place some scriptures on record to suggest that Hindus used to worship the place as Lord Rama Janmsthan. The bench restrained Mishra from placing any materials and curtailed his arguments asking another senior advocate Shushil Kumar Jain to continue his arguments. Dhavan periodically raised objections when advocates for the Hindu parties tried to bring out some new facts and materials to counter the arguments of the opposing sides.

 Won't grant any extra day after Oct 18 to complete arguments: SC tells parties in Ayodhya case | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In a clear indication that judgment in Ayodhya dispute case is likely to be delivered before CJI Ranjan Gogoi's retirement in November, the Supreme Court on Thursday said that it cannot grant even a single extra day beyond October 18 to all petitioners to complete their submissions. A five-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that it doesn't want to give even ""one day extra"" beyond October 18 after it was apprised by the lawyers that their submissions will be completed by the said date in ""all the possibilities and manner"". Today was the 32nd day of the day-to-day hearing on a batch of appeals filed by Muslim and Hindu parties challenging the 2010 Allahabad high court judgment, which has ruled to divide the disputed site into three equal parts. The bench will write the landmark judgement for ownership of 2.77-acre land once the arguments are concluded by lawyers of UP Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmoni Akhada and Ram Deity -- three parties in the case. On September 18, the court said that arguments have to be completed by October 18 even as the mediation panel may continue its work under confidentiality. ""As per the estimate of tentative dates to finish the hearing in the case, we can say that the submissions have to be likely completed by October 18,"" Gogoi had said. Earlier, the court had observed that the hearing of the appeals, which is at a very advanced stage, will continue without any interruption. It is to be noted that CJI Gogoi is set to demit office on November 17 and he has to deliver the judgement before that as he had entirely heard the case from the beginning of the arguments. The court had also said that simultaneously the mediation process can go along with the hearing and if an amicable settlement is reached through by it, the same can be filed before the court. The day-to-day hearing started on August 6 after a court-appointed mediation panel failed to resolve the dispute through amicable settlement.

" Belief of Ram Janmabhoomi as deity tenuous, SC told | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Muslim parties seeking title over the 2.77 acre disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land in Ayodhya told the Supreme Court on Monday that Hindu parties had cited “tenuous” evidence to prop up Ram Janmabhoomi as a deity with the motive to destroy the mosque and build a temple over the disputed land. Arguing before a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan said filing of the suit by deity Ram Lalla and propping up Ram Janmabhoomi as deity in addition to Ram Lalla in 1989 was a Sangh Parivar game plan to destroy the mosque and build a temple through the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, which was set up in 1985. “The entire claim of Hindu parties is that they have been worshipping Ram Janmabhoomi as a deity since centuries with the faith that Lord Ram was born there. They have provided no evidence as to when such a belief manifested Ram Janmabhoomi into a deity and conferred on its the status of a juristic person. Without evidence on manifestation, consecration and continuous worship, no entity could attain deity status to acquire juristic person status. A deity must have some form, either man-made or natural,” Dhavan argued. The bench asked, “Is it necessary for an entity to manifest in some shape for the purpose of worship by devotees to attain status of a deity? Is divine manifestation required for worshipping a deity? There can be a deity without it having the form of an idol. In Chidambaram temples, empty space is worshipped. How does one consecrate an empty space as consecration (prana-pratishtha) is done only for a idol?” Dhavan then went on to fault the filing of the suit by the deity through next friend Deoki Nandan Agrawal. He said the idols were surreptitiously placed under the central dome of the mosque on the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949, the date which should be taken as the beginning of limitation period for filing the suit. But the suit was filed after 40 years in 1989 without even a whisper as to how Nirmohi Akhara, which had filed the suit in 1959, was derelict in its ‘sevait’ duties to confer locus standi on the next friend. “A deity’s human agent is the ‘sevait’ who alone can manage and control the property and its affairs. In the event the sevait is not acting, or acting against the interests of the deity, or mismanaging or trying to appropriate the property, a next friend can file a suit on behalf of the deity or idol. In the present case, the next friend is not a believer, belongs to the Nyas, which intends to destroy the property, build a new temple, and take over the management, excluding the sevait,” Dhavan said and sought dismissal of the suit filed on behalf of the deity. He also emphasised that Shia Waqf Board’s contention that the disputed land belonged to them and that they wanted to give it to the Hindus for construction of a temple was preposterous. The Shia board had filed a suit in 1945 for ownership right over Babri Masjid claiming it to be a Shia property but a Faizabad court had dismissed the suit in 1946 and recognised the Sunni Waqf Board as the owner. The Shia board filed an appeal in 2017 seeking to challenge the 1946 decision, which was time barred. “The stance of the Shia board to give away land that does not belong to them is unworthy and illegal,” Dhavan said. Arguments will continue on Tuesday. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 SC to get permanent Constitution bench | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: For the first time in its nearly 70-year-long history, the Supreme Court is set to realise the dream of Constitution-framers by creating a permanent five-judge Constitution bench, to be available round the year to adjudicate complex constitutional questions and interpret laws. Starting with a strength of eight judges in 1950, including the Chief Justice of India, the judges’ strength is now 34, with a recent amendment by Parliament after CJI Ranjan Gogoi wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlining the urgent need for an increase in SC judges’ strength in proportion to the increase in litigation. This gave CJI Gogoi freedom to decide that from October 1, the SC will have a permanent five-judge bench. As per earlier practice, a two-judge bench, if it found an important question of law in a case, referred the issue to a three-judge bench, which referred certain select important cases for adjudication by a Constitution bench. The CJI then used to weigh pendency of cases, engagement of judges in other important cases which were at a stage of being partly heard and then select five judges who could take up Constitution bench matters without disturbing the rate of disposal. Over the last three decades, setting up five-judge benches has been a challenging task for successive CJIs, given the exponential increase in filing of cases, triggered by numerous SC decisions expanding the writ jurisdiction to create the instrument of PIL and widening the span of fundamental rights. The SC also has 164 matters referred by two-judge benches to three-judge benches. CJI Gogoi has decided to set up five permanent three-judge benches to take up these long-pending 164 cases. Till now, only one or two three-judge benches functioned daily. But with routine workload assigned to these benches, it prevented them from devoting adequate time to hear detailed arguments in these cases. PILs raising important questions of law, scams and human rights violations have been consuming significant judicial time, making it difficult for successive CJIs to disengage judges from such issues and include them in Constitution benches, a process that would block five judges for a long period. In the US and certain other countries, all the judges of the Supreme Court sit together and decide those petitions which are certified by the full court to be of constitutional importance. Nearly 90% of the cases filed in the US SC are rejected at the threshold and never heard by the court. CJI Gogoi, as head of the collegium, would be credited for appointing a record 14 judges to the SC. During his tenure as CJI, the SC twice achieved its full strength — of 31 judges in May this year and again of 34 judges now. With four new judges scheduled to take oath on Monday, the CJI worked out a scheme by which the SC would truly discharge its duties as a constitutional court with a permanent five-judge bench. There are 37 matters pending for adjudication by the Constitution bench. The Ayodhya issue had been gathering dust since 2010 and CJI Gogoi decided to take it up despite the option of keeping pending a case that is termed as most important in judicial and national history. Even during the day-to-day hearing of the Ayodhya issue, the CJI had to squeeze out an hour daily to ensure that chambers for the new judges got ready prior to them taking oath to ensure that a full-strength SC functioned smoothly. With the setting up of a permanent five-judge Constitution bench and five three-judge benches, as many as 20 of the 34 benches would be engaged in adjudicating constitutional questions and important matters. The rest 14 judges would function as seven two-judge benches. With the SC deciding to amend its rules allowing the CJI to set up single-judge benches for dealing with anticipatory and bail petitions, as was the practice till the 1980s, there could be more than seven benches that could be formed by CJI Gogoi for expeditious reduction in pendency of cases which has risen to nearly 60,000 cases.

" Ayodhya case: Archaeological data wasn’t studied by experts, says SC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday reiterated that the study paper submitted by four historians, termed “eminent” by the Sunni Waqf Board to counter Hindu parties’ ownership claim over the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid disputed site, “could at best be regarded as an opinion”. When senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan repeatedly invoked what he called the eminence of the historians to urge the court to give more weightage to to their opinion and not damn their May 13, 1991, study paper titled ‘Babri Mosque or Rama’s Birthplace? Historians Report to the Indian Nation’, a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer said, “These historians did not examine the archaeological data. It is not to damn them, but since the specific evidence through excavation by Archaeological Survey of India had not been taken into account by them, it at the highest will be an opinion of the historians.” Dhavan said he would add the adjective “experts” before the historians. One of the four historians, Prof Suraj Bhan, deposed as an expert witness for Sunni Waqf Board before the Allahabad HC in three phases, from February 22, 2000, to August 10, 2000; from August 26, 2002, to September 12, 2002, and then from March 20, 2006, to March 28, 2006. Bhan did his postgraduate in Sanskrit from Delhi University in 1955 and joined the ASI as technical assistant in 1956 -1957. Bhan did a further MA in archaeology in 1960. He got his PhD degree in 1975 on ‘Historic Archaeology of Saraswati and Drishdavati Valleys’. Following are excerpts from his deposition before Allahabad HC: “I am an MA in Sanskrit language. I cannot speak Sanskrit and since I have not used it for quite some time, I face difficulty in reading as also following it.”  “Since construction of mosques after demolishing temples is not the subject of my research, so I did not make an endeavour to make a study of those places. Otherwise also, I am not a historian with regard to medieval period... I did not read Skanda Purana. I don’t think it is necessary to read other Puranas also as their study is not my subject. But it is true that I am not a specialist in history.”  “I am not a specialist in sculpture. Epigraphy, too, is not my field. My speciality was field archaeology, not ethnography. I am not a specialist in history of temple architecture.”  Only (R S) Sharma and myself had gone to Ayodhya at the time of Ayodhya research. Out of four impartial historians, two of us had gone to Ayodhya. We were given only six weeks time for the entire study. Pressure was being repeatedly exerted; so we submitted our report without going through the record of the (archaeological) excavation work by B B Lal.”  “It is true that I am not a specialist in history. My testimony in this litigation has been only as an archaeologist.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Hindu Mahasabha opposes restart of Ayodhya mediation | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: A day after the Supreme Court-appointed mediation panel headed by former Supreme Court judge F M I Kalifulla moved the apex court, seeking its view on a request for resumption of talks for settlement of the Ayodhya dispute, Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Mahasabha, key litigant in the case, termed the move as a “conspiracy” to delay the Ram temple. Nirmohi Akhara too opposed the move to go back to the mediation table. National president of Hindu Mahasabha Chakrapani Maharaj said it was a conspiracy and a delaying tactic when the apex court was on the verge of declaring the verdict. “The Hindu Mahasaba would launch a statewide agitation to oppose the decision,” Chakrapani said. Mahasabha national spokesperson Narendra Srivastava said it would mobilize seers from across the country to reach Ayodhya if the verdict was not delivered soon. “Mediation was deliberately failed and now they want to restart talks. This would only delay temple construction,” he told TOI on Tuesday. The Nirmohi Akhara, one of the litigants in the title suit, too opposed the move. “The matter is being taken up by Supreme Court and now going back to mediation won’t be the right decision,’’ chief of Nirmohi Akhara, Mahant Dinendra Das told TOI. The Justice Kalifulla panel, which comprised renowned mediator and senior advocate Sriram Panchu and spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar moved a memorandum in SC, requesting it to be placed before the Chief Justice of India, which started day-to-day hearing on appeals in the vexed Ayodhya case.

Ram Mandir News: Supreme Court seeks date for end of Ayodhya arguments | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked Hindu and Muslim parties to submit an estimate of time they would take to conclude their arguments in the Ayodhya land dispute case so as to allow the court to estimate how much time it will have to write the judgment. The court’s remarks during the hearing on the 70-year-old claims on the ownership of the 2.77 acre disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land reinforce the impression that the SC is keen to deliver a ruling before Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi demits office on November 17. On the 25th day of arguments, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the Muslim parties, sought a day off on Friday. To this, a five-judge constitution bench, which is headed by CJI Gogoi, said, “All parties must indicate when they will conclude their arguments. Depending on that we can decide the off days for argument.” SC may deliver verdict on or before November 17When the parties indicate the tentative schedule for completion of their submissions and arguments, we (judges) will know how much time we have in hand to write the judgment. Talk to your (the leading advocates) associates and give us a rough estimate,” the bench said. The inquiry by the bench is significant because the SC may deliver its verdict on or before November 17 when the CJI retires. If for any reason, the judgment is not pronounced by then, the new CJI will have to reconstitute the five-judge bench and arguments may have to be heard afresh with a new judge replacing Justice Gogoi. The CJI suggested that if Dhavan needed an off on Friday, other counsel for Muslim parties — Jafaryab Jilani, Meenakshi Arora and Mohd Nizam Pasha — could argue on that day. Dhavan opposed it and said he did not want to break the continuity of his arguments by another counsel from the Muslim side making submissions in between. “We want a judgment in this case. But I do not want to break continuity of my arguments. On Friday, let all of us have an off,” Dhavan said.

UP: Kalyan Singh dares Opposition to clarify stand on Ram Mandir issue | Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Soon after rejoining BJP on Monday, former UP chief minister, Kalyan Singh, under whose regime Babri Masjid was razed in 1992, threw a challenge to Opposition parties, asking them to clarify their stand on Ram temple, saying the issue involves the faith of crores of Hindus for whom Ayodhya is sacred. “I don’t want to do politics but the Opposition needs to clarify its stand on the issue,” said Kalyan, who completed his term as Rajasthan governor recently. Earlier, Kalyan was accorded a grand welcome on reaching BJP headquarters in Lucknow. He joined the party in presence of UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, and was accompanied by his son, Rajveer Singh, who is MP from Etah. Speaking to reporters at his Mall Avenue residence which was dotted with posters hailing him as ‘Ramjanmabhoomi Ke Nayak...Hindu Hriday Samrat’, Kalyan said he hasn’t ‘retired’ yet. “For me, politics is a means to serve the people,” he said, while clarifying that he would not contest elections. “I did not speak much in last five years during my term as governor, but am happy to see BJP grow as the biggest party in world,” he added. “There is no alternative to BJP now, both at Centre and in state. This further increases the responsibilities of party workers. As a worker, I would try my best to take the party forward,” he said. Targeting opposition, Singh said SP, BSP and Congress would never be able to make a comeback as they have lost their ‘janaadhar’ (public support), while BJP has managed to touch every section of society. Hailing the Yogi Adityanath government, he said UP has witnessed a lot of change since BJP came to power. “The law and order situation has improved and there has not been a single communal riot,” he said. Considered a fire-brand Hindutva and OBC leader, Kalyan took BJP to new heights during Ram temple movement of early 90s.

 'Hindus have prayed at Babri site since 1885' | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Muslim parties to the Ayodhya dispute admitted before the Supreme Court on Thursday that Hindus have been offering prayers at Ram Chabutra within the Babri Masjid precincts since 1885, when a civil court had granted the community right to worship while denying them title over the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid structure. Countering the Hindu parties' claim that the community has been offering prayers at Ram Janmasthan since time immemorial, Muslim parties through senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan told a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices SA Bobde, DY Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer, ""The tall claims about worshipping there since time immemorial have not been substantiated through evidence. ""I accept that they (Hindus) worshipped there from 1885. I cannot deny the documents which establish this fact. Between 1885 and 1934, when communal riots damaged the mosque, they were praying at Ram Chabutra temple that was in the precincts of Babri Masjid but outside the structure. This is acceptable but not claims about offering prayers there since time immemorial, or for 2,000 years or 700 years."" The Muslim parties had on Wednesday agreed to coexist with Hindus offering prayers at Ram Chabutra in the outer courtyard of the mosque, which was demolished by kar sevaks on December 6, 1992. However, they had insisted on ownership of the 2.77 acre disputed land as a condition for them to extend the courtesy of allowing Hindus to offer prayers at Ram Chabutra. Dhavan carried out a detailed exercise to point out contradictions in the statements of witnesses who had supported 'sevait' (priestly) rights of Nirmohi Akhara. The Allahabad High Court on September 30, 2010, had divided the disputed land into three equal parts with one each to Ram Lalla, Akhara and Sunni Waqf Board. Justice Chandrachud asked Dhavan, ""If you are questioning the veracity of statements by witnesses in support of 'sevait' (priestly) rights of Nirmohi Akhara, then how can you support the Akhara's sevait rights? Either the statement of the witnesses stand or they go because of the contradictions you are pointing out."" Dhavan replied, ""We want to clarify that Akhara had sevait rights only at Ram Chabutra. I am only separating the incredible claims from credible part of the statements of witnesses in the suit filed by the Akhara in 1959."" He said some of these witnesses even denied a recorded fact that idols were placed surreptitiously on the night of December 22, 1949. ""That much reliability can be placed on their statements,"" he said. Arguments will resume on Monday. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 SC asks Muslims if they accept Akhara's claim on Ayodhya land despite tall claims of witnesses | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday took note of allegations of Muslim parties that many witnesses of Nirmohi Akhara made ""tall claims"" in their testimonies and asked them whether they still accept that it has rights over the disputed Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri masjid land at Ayodhya. A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi considered the submission of senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for Sunni Waqf Board and others including original litigant M Siddiq, that there were ""discrepancies"" and ""contradictions' in statements of witnesses examined by the Akhara in favour of its lawsuit. ""Somebody said Nirmohi Akhara came into being 700 years ago, some said 250 years ago... A witness said Lord Ram was there 12 lakh years ago... ""But, I cannot get away from the fact that there are records that Nirmohi Akhara was there in 1855-56 and a suit was filed (by Mahant Raghubar Das) in 1885,"" the senior advocate told the bench also comprising justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesA witness, who had testified in over 200 cases, believed that there was ""no harm in telling a lie"" if a place has been forcibly taken away, he said. ""Despite these contradictions, you still maintain that they (Nirmohi Akhara) have established their shebaiti (managing) rights,"" the bench asked. If the 'shebaitship"" of Nirmohi Akhara was accepted, then their evidence will also be accepted, the bench said on the 20th day of the hearing in the politically-sensitive case. Right as 'shebait' was restricted to the plea seeking right to manage, charge and worship at the site and it did not give rise to any ownership claim to 'Akahara', Dhavan, who was assisted by lawyer Ejaz Maqbool, said. These witnesses cannot be called ""liars in toto"", but the Muslim parties ""stand by"" with their claim that the incident of placing of idols inside the central dome on the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949 at the disputed site did take place, Dhavan said and urged the bench that part of testimonies, contrary to Muslims' claim, be discarded. ""I accept that Nirmohis are 'shebaits' of 'Ram Chabutara in outer courtyard. Some part (of statements of testimonies) is not credible. The tall claims are not correct,"" he said. He said a 'shebait' can be the manager of the property and can live on its earnings, but ""certainly"" it has no title rights over such an asset. Referring to pleadings of Akhara, Dhavan said it has claimed that ""'Janmsthan' now commonly known as 'Janmabhoomi' ... belongs and has always belonged to the plaintiff no. 1 (Akhara) who through its reigning 'Mahant' ... has ever since been managing it and receiving offerings made there at in form of money, sweets, flowers and fruits and other articles and things."" Dhavan alleged that Akhara by using terms -- belong and belonging to -- in its lawsuit has sought ownership of the entire disputed site and idols there. He then extensively dealt with the meaning of the terms by citing dictionary and judgments and said there was a ""contrast"" between terms ""belonging to"" and ""ownership"". ""Without prejudice..., a question was raised about the meaning of the word 'belong' and 'belonging to'. It is submitted that they (terms) connote ownership with some flexibility,"" he said. The bench asked Dhavan as to why he was stressing on these terms as they were not part of law and moreover, Akhara has been seeking management and charge of the property. If Akhara says that it is a 'shebait', which is the manager and in service of the deity, to whom the land belongs then it may construed that the land is owned by the deity and managed by the 'shebait', the bench said. ""Nirmohi Akhara's right as shebait does not exist without the deity and the 'shebait' being in the service and management of the deity has the right to serve and protect the interest of the deity,"" it said. Dhavan then said the lawsuit of Akhara was time-barred under the law of limitation as they said that their cause of action started when the receiver took possession of the disputed site on January 5, 1950 and the case was filed in 1959 which is beyond the three year time limit. The bench said that Akhara has argued that it was a case of ""continuous wrong"" as the deprivation from management and prayer rights continued and moreover, no final adjudication on the attachment proceedings took place and hence the plea of Akhara was not time-barred. ""As the final order was not passed in the Section 145 proceedings (attachment of site). So Akhara says that the Limitation dos not run against it. What You (Dhavan) have to say,"" it asked. When did the cause of action arise, it started on January 5, 1950 and they filed the case in 1959, Dhavan said, adding that Akhara ""muddled up"" their case. Dhavan would continue his submissions on September 11. The Allahabad high court, in its judgment of 2010 on four civil lawsuits, had partitioned the 2.77-acre disputed land equally among Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla. Fourteen appeals have been filed in the Supreme Court against the verdict. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Ayodhya hearing: 'Miscreants' can't have claim, Muslim parties tell SC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Relying on a 25-year-old Supreme Court judgment calling those who demolished the Babri Masjid ""miscreants"", Muslim parties on Tuesday argued before the court that ""miscreants"" who demolished the mosque could not claim ownership over the 2.77 acre disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land in Ayodhya.  Appearing before a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan said ""miscreants"" had also planned and surreptitiously placed idols inside the mosque on the night of December 22, 1949, and ""miscreants"" harassed Muslims to dissuade them from offering namaz regularly at the mosque since the 1934 communal riots in which the structure was damaged.  ""Can these actions of 'miscreants' preventing Muslims from access to the mosque be taken now as a ground by the Hindus to claim ownership through adverse possession?"" he asked while citing the SC's 1994 judgment in Ismail Faruqui case, in which it had appointed the Centre as the receiver of the disputed land as well as the surrounding area which was acquired through a 1993 notification after the Babri Masjid was demolished.  A three-judge bench of the SC had said in 1994, ""The miscreants who demolished the mosque had no religion, caste or creed except the character of a criminal and the mere incident of birth of such a person in any particular community cannot attach the stigma of his crime to the community in which he was born.""  However, in the very next paragraph of the judgment, the SC had said, ""The miscreants who demolished the mosque are suspected to be persons professing to practise the Hindu religion. The Hindu community must, therefore, bear the cross on its chest, for the misdeed of the miscreants reasonably suspected to belong to their religious fold."" Dhavan made full use of the 25-year-old judgment to attempt to drive home the point of Muslim parties that those responsible for demolishing the mosque could not claim ownership through adverse possession. Dhavan said there was an unmistakable conspiracy hatched by Hindus since March 1949, which in connivance with then deputy commissioner K K Nair led to placing of idols of Ram Lalla inside the mosque under the main dome. ""The idols were outside the structure on Ram Chabutra till then and Hindus were worshipping it there,"" he said.  ""It was no spontaneous act of Hindus to place the idols inside the mosque. They did not let Muslims to pray there and then said the community did not offer namaz at the mosque,"" he said.  Dhavan adopted Nirmohi Akhara's argument which questioned maintainability of Ram Lalla's suit. Arguments will continue on Wednesday. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Ram Mandir verdict news: Chances brighten for verdict in Ayodhya case in November | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Chances of the Supreme Court giving a final verdict in November in the 70-year-old litigation for ownership of the 2.77 acre Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land in Ayodhya brightened as all Hindu parties, who were awarded two-thirds of the disputed land by the Allahabad High Court, have completed their arguments. The hearing had started on August 6. Giving a patient hearing to counsel but not allowing them to repeat or reiterate each other’s arguments, a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer appeared to have achieved the unimaginable — completion of arguments on behalf of deity Ram Lalla, Nirmohi Akhara, All India Ram Janmasthan Punaruthan Samiti, two factions of Hindu Mahasabha, Shia Waqf Board and legal heir of Gopal Singh Visharad, who had first instituted a suit in 1951 after idols were installed inside Babri Masjid in December 1949. Does Mughal ‘farman’ hold key to Ayodhya land row?The Allahabad HC had divided the 2.77 acre disputed land equally among three parties, with one-third going to deity Ram Lalla under the central dome of the mosque prior to its demolition in 1992, another third comprising the Ram Chabutra and Sita Rasoi to Nirmohi Akhara and the last third to Sunni Waqf Board. With arguments on behalf of deity Ram Lalla and Nirmohi Akhara getting over on Day 16 of the proceedings, the main party left to advance arguments is Sunni Waqf Board represented by senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, who had protested against the five-days-a-week hearing schedule fixed by the SC. Not opposing deity’s plea: Nirmohi AkharaWith many in the court corridors wondering whether the bench would be able to conclude proceedings and deliver a judgment before the retirement of CJI Gogoi on November 17, the completion of arguments by parties awarded two-thirds of the disputed land brightens the chances of the court delivering the final verdict in November. When asked by the bench, Dhavan had earlier said he would take 20 days to complete arguments on behalf of Sunni Wakf Board. Even if Dhavan lives up to his assertion, it would still leave the SC with more than a month to firm up its verdict on the issue that possibly could give a quietus to a dispute that had rocked the polity since opening of locks of disputed structure’s gate in 1986, followed by its demolition by kar sevaks in December 1992. Shia Waqf Board, through M C Dhingra, supported the claim of Hindu parties over the disputed structure and said idols were placed in the mosque in 1949, it used to be under a Shia ‘mutwali’ (in charge of the structure). However, in 1946, a court had dismissed the Shias’ claim to manage the disputed structure but the Shia Waqf Board filed an appeal only in 2017 in the SC, which is pending. For a Hindu party, senior advocate P N Mishra argued on the basis of Islamic laws that Babri Masjid could never be regarded as a mosque. “The disputed structure was built on land which did not belong to Babur or Mir Baqi. The land was never voluntarily given for waqf purpose by its owner in Ayodhya. Namaz was not offered twice a day regularly for it to qualify as a mosque. There were temple bells, idols and pictures of animals inside the structure making it unfit to be a mosque. A mosque cannot co-exist with a temple and a mosque built over demolished temple is impermissible in Islamic law. According to 17th century ‘farman’ of emperor Shahjahan, once a temple, always a temple. Lastly, Hindus have been worshipping at the disputed structure continuously for centuries,” he said.

Ayodhya dispute: Not opposing deity’s plea: Nirmohi Akhara | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Nirmohi Akhara on Tuesday dropped its strong opposition to deity Ram Lalla’s suit claiming ownership over the 2.77 acres of Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land in Ayodhya to settle for a conciliatory approach where it said it would never seek relief at the cost of the deity’s interests. At the beginning of Day 13 of proceedings, senior advocate Sushil Jain read out Nirmohi Akhara’s statement on maintainability of the suit filed by Devki Nandan Agarwal on behalf of the deity Ram Lalla. “The Akhara will not press the issue of maintainability of suit number 5 of 1989, which has been filed on behalf of the deities through Agarwal as their next friend provided other Hindu parties do not press or question the ‘sevait’ right of Akhara in relation to the deities in question and maintainability of Nirmohi Akhara’s suit,” Jain said. “A suit filed by Akhara ‘as a sevait’ is a suit filed by and on behalf of the deities. The relief sought by Akhara for ‘restoration of charge and management from receiver’ cannot be categorised as a relief against the interest of the deities for which it can be said that they should be represented as a defendant through a disinterested next friend,” Jain told a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer. However, Jain clarified that the Akhara’s stand required a similar gesture from other Hindu parties. Senior advocate P N Mishra, appearing for Ram Janmasthan Punaruthan Samiti (RJPS), gave an interesting twist to the proceedings. He cited various historical accounts given by Hans Baker, Alois Anton Fuhrer, Henry Beveridge and Z A Desai to question the popular perception that Babur’s general Mir Baqi constructed the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in 1528 AD, two years after Babur conquered India and established Mughal rule. Mishra said these historical accounts based on translation of inscriptions on pillars and slabs rendered a confusing and unrealistic account. The references variously mention the mosque being constructed by Mir Baqi in 1528, by Mir Khan in 1523, byy Abdul Baqi Isphani in 1516 as well as contained reference to being built by Baqi Tashkandi and Mir Baqu. “So who was the person who constructed it?” he asked. Moreover, Babur Nama and Babur’s daughter’s Humayun Nama, the two biographical accounts of the first two Mughal emperors, did not make any mention of Babri Masjid being built in Ayodhya though these referred to many areas around Ayodhya, Mishra said. Mishra said this was the reason why Allahabad HC had said, “We are perturbed by the manner in which Ashraf Hussain/Desai have tried to give an impeccable authority to the tests of alleged inscriptions which they claim to have existed on the disputed building though repeatedly said that the original text has disappeared. The fallacy and complete misrepresentation on the part of the author in trying to give colour of truth to this text is writ large from a bare reading of the write-up. We are really at pains to find that such blatant fallacious kind of material has been allowed to be published under the authority of Archaeological Survey of India, government of India, without caring about its accuracy, correctness and genuineness of the subject.” In Video:Nirmohi Akhara drops its strong opposition to deity Ram Lalla’s suitDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

" CJI in ‘urgent’ meet, SC skips Ayodhya case on Monday | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court’s five-judge constitution bench did not hear the Ayodhya land dispute case on Monday owing to an urgent meeting of CJI Ranjan Gogoi. Five chairs for the judges were in place till 10.30 am, the scheduled time for commencement of hearing, and the counsel for parties had taken their seats in the front rows as it was the turn of senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan, appearing for deity Ram Lalla, to conclude his arguments on Monday. But a little later, two chairs were removed by the court staff, indicating that an alternative three-judge bench would take up other cases. However, at 10.45 am, it was announced that the alternative bench too would not sit on Monday, thus cancelling the day’s listed business before the CJI’s court. Justice S A Bobde, who is part of the five-judge bench for the Ayodhya matter, too did not take up cases listed for hearing as an alternative bench in the event the constitution bench did not sit. Speculation was rife as to the reason behind the sudden cancellation of the Ayodhya hearing, which has been progressing on a day-to-day basis on all five week days. SC sources said the Chief Justice of India and Justice Bobde had urgent engagements and did not elaborate on the reason for the cancellation.

"Now, Mewar royals claim Lord Ram lineage | Jaipur News - Times of India","UDAIPUR/JAIPUR: A day after BJP MP and member of the erstwhile Jaipur royal family Diya Kumari claimed to be the descendant of Lord Ram’s son Kush, the erstwhile royal family of Mewar has come up with a similar claim. “It is historically proven that my family is a direct descendant of Lord Ram. We do not wish to stake any claim on Ram Janmabhumi, but believe that Ram Temple must be built in Ayodhya,” Arvind Singh of the erstwhile Mewar royal family tweeted on Monday. Speaking to TOI, he said there were many books that mentioned his family descended from Ram and belonged to the ‘Raghuvansh’ lineage.Singh said the claim was supported by the fact that the Mewar House, too, worshipped Lord Shiva and the Sun, which is the emblem of the dynasty. “One of the greatest and most revered saints of Mewar, poet Chatar Singh ji Bhavji, in his book ‘Chatur Chintamani’ has referred to Maharana Pratap as a ‘Raghuvanshi’ and descendant of Lord Ram. There are many other historical evidences to the claim that we come from ‘Surya Vansham’. I am from the 232nd generation of the ‘Surya Vansh’ and as a representative of the common man, I want to support the people’s wish to build a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya,” Singh said. Mahendra Singh, elder brother of Arvind Singh Mewar, said, “I got to know that the Supreme Court has asked whether there were any descendants of Lord Ram in the world. If this is the case, then the Supreme Court can directly contact us and all the evidence and documents will be produced in the court following proper legal procedure.” Not only erstwhile royals, even common Rajputs have joined the bandwagon of claiming the lineage of Lord Ram. Congress’ state spokesperson and lawyer Satyendra Raghav has claimed that his clan too is “the descendant” of the Hindu God. “The Raghav Rajputs are the real descendants of Lord Ram,” Raghav contended in his Facebook post. He repeated his claim while talking to TOI on Monday. Raghav cited Valmiki's ‘Ramayana’ for his claim, saying his family, belonging to Alwar ‘thikana' (royalty), are of the Badgurjar Gotra, which is the third generation of Luv, the elder son of Lord Ram. “The kingdom of Luv spread towards North Kaushal, which now comes under Ayodhya, while (Lord Ram’s younger son) Kush spread his empire to South Kaushal, which comes under Chhattisgarh. On page 1,671 of the ‘Ramayana’, it is said that Badgurjar clan came from Luv,” said Raghav, a relative of former vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.

" Are descendants of Lord Ram still there at Ayodhya, asks SC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Curious to know whether anyone from the 'Raghuvansha' (descendants of Lord Ram) was still residing in Ayodhya, the Supreme Court Friday put this query to 'Ram Lalla Virajman', the deity and one of the parties in the politically sensitive Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute. A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi put the question to senior advocate K Parasaran, appearing for 'Ram Lalla Virajman', when he was arguing that the deity and the birth place both were ""juristic"" entities and hence, capable of holding properties and instituting lawsuits. ""We are just wondering if anyone from the 'Raghuvansha' dynasty is still living there (at Ayodhya),"" said the bench, also comprising Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer. The bench said that it was asking just out of curiosity. ""I have no information. We will try to find it out,"" Parasaran responded. On the fourth day of the hearing, Parasaran was responding to the apex court's query as to how the 'Janmasthanam' (birth place of deity) can be regarded as a ""juristic person"" having stakes as a litigant in the case. ""The idol is not necessary in the Hinduism for a place to be regarded as a temple,"" he said, adding ""Hindus do not worship Gods in any definite form, rather they worship them as divine incarnation having no form."" Referring to Hindu religious texts, the senior lawyer said that one such example is Kedarnath temple where there is no idol of any deity. Hence, there is no need of any idol for terming a place as a temple, having the character of ""jurisctic"" person capable to own properties and institute lawsuits, he said. Hindus started worshipping Lord Ram even before the idol was installed and temple was built, Parasaran said. ""The deity is treated as a living being and is considered as the master of the house,"" he said. The top court, meanwhile, made clear that it would continue with the day-to-day hearing of the land dispute case and would consider granting mid-week breaks to senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, counsel for Muslim parties including litigant M Siddiq, for preparing arguments. The arguments in the case will continue on August 13. Earlier, the bench had asked the counsel for the deity as to how the birth place of Lord Ram can be regarded as a ""juristic person"" having stakes as a litigant in the case. It had said that so far as Hindu deities are concerned, they have been legally treated as juristic person which can hold properties and institute, defend and intervene in lawsuits. However, it asked as to how 'Janamsthanam' can file the case in the land dispute as party. Parasaran had said that even the birth place of the deity can be considered as a juristic person. The law suit filed by the deity in the Ayodhya case has also made the birth place of Lord Ram as co-petitioner and has sought claim over the entire 2.77 acre of disputed land at Ayodhya where the structure was razed on December 6, 1992. Fourteen appeals have been filed in the apex court against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment, delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land in Ayodhya be partitioned equally among the three parties -- the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla. On December 6, 1992, the Babri Masjid, constructed at the disputed site in the 16th century by Shia Muslim Mir Baqi, was demolished. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Maintain decorum: CJI Gogoi to senior counsel after run-in | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Irrepressible senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for Muslim parties in the Ayodhya land dispute case in the SC, on Tuesday had a run-in with CJI Ranjan Gogoi, who in turn told him that as an officer of the court, he must strive to maintain decorum. An hour into the arguments, when senior advocate Sushil Jain was making submissions on behalf of Nirmohi Akhara, CJI Gogoi told him that he needed to argue his best points to substantiate his claim for possession of the entire disputed land rather than foraying into the subject matter of other title suits. “These are not important for your case,” the CJI said, adding that when the other appeals were argued, Jain could counter them then. But Dhavan asked, “Is the CJI saying these are not important? I will place them when I argue.” The CJI told him that he could place them when his turn came. “We said no one’s arguments will be curtailed. You (Dhavan) will have full opportunity to place documents before the court when your turn comes,” the CJI said. Dhavan replied, “I hope so.” The CJI asked, “Do you doubt?” Not to be put down, Dhavan retorted, “Yes, some.” The CJI told Dhavan that he must not forget that he was an officer of the court and must keep the dignity of the court in mind. Dhavan said, “I am an officer of the court and I answered questions which fell from the court.” The CJI said, “There are ways of answering questions.” Dhavan said, “That is my answer.” But, throughout the day, Dhavan sat quiet. During the earlier hearing on the Ayodhya dispute before a three-judge bench, Dhavan and other counsel had annoyed the then CJI by questioning his hurry to hear the appeals and had made efforts for its adjournment till general elections were over. Despite the hype over commencement of day-to-day hearing on the appeals against a 2010 verdict of Allahabad HC, lack of enthusiasm for the proceedings was palpable with very few ‘sants’ attending the hearing. Even the crowd inside the courtroom was thin on Tuesday. There were a large number of court officials to assist the court in making available original documents cited before the HC during arguments on the title suits and evidence led during the proceedings, all of which were kept inside six big steel trunks.

In his plea moved on Saturday, Govindacharya had requested a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi for live streaming of the Ayodhya case proceedings, which began today.

There are crores of persons, including the petitioner, who want to witness proceedings before this court, but cannot do the same due to the present norms of the Supreme Court."" ""If live streaming is not feasible as of now, then the proceedings can be recorded on audio or video by the court officers and transcripts of the court proceedings can be released on the top court website later on,"" the plea said. He said that people were desperate for early justice in the Ram Temple matter, wherein Lord Ram was kept in a makeshift tent for the past many years. ""This matter has been pending in the Supreme Court for the last nine years, and the public at large is interested in knowing the reasons behind the delay in deciding the cases,"" the petitioner further added.

Sources close to the panel told TOI that since a negotiated settlement was favoured by a majority of stakeholders except Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and to some extent by the VHP-backed Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, the doors of mediation could still be kept open despite the SC commencing day-to-day hearing on Ayodhya land dispute case. Sources said there were two factions of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, one led by Mahmood Madani and the other by Arshad Madani. “Mehmood Madani-led faction was inclined for a negotiated settlement but the Arshad Madani-led faction did not relent from its hardline stance against negotiated settlement,” a source said. “If Jamiat had agreed to participate in the process for a negotiated settlement, the mediation would have ended on a happy note,” the source said. The panel led by Justice Kalifulla, also comprising renowned mediator and senior advocate Sriram Panchu and spiritual leader Sr Sri Ravishankar, had offered a broad outline for the negotiated settlement to all sides, and it found acceptance with many. The panel had proposed that in lieu of a Ram temple at the disputed site, Muslims and Hindus could have the right to offer prayer as well as worship at nearly 400 disputed mosques (which are also claimed by Hindus) across the country which are currently under the control of Archaeological Survey of India. Sources said the mediation panel was of the view that the Nyas’s opposition was not insurmountable but the extreme stand of one of the Jamiat factions played spoilsport. They said the beauty of mediation was that it never died down completely and could be revived at any moment. “Even when the day-to-day hearing is going on, mediation can result in success and the SC will be more than happy to record the settlement to bring an end to the vexed litigation that has been going on for 70 years,” the source said.

 All attempts to resolve Ayodhya dispute through amicable settlement remain unsuccessful | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: All the four attempts, including two on the intervention of the Supreme Court, to amicably settle the long-standing land dispute at Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid in Ayodhya have failed to yield the desired result. The mediation proceedings failed to resolve the dispute amicably for the fourth time on Friday, with the Supreme Court ordering day-to-day hearing of the politically sensitive case from August 6. A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi took note of the report of the three member mediation panel, headed by former apex court judge FMI Kalifulla, that its effort to find out an amicable resolution to the dispute have failed. Before the bench on March 8 referred the dispute for mediation, a similar move was favoured by the then Chief Justice J S Khehar on March 21, 2017. A bench headed by the Justice Khehar had said that fresh attempts must be made by all parties concerned to find a solution to the Ayodhya temple dispute which is a ""sensitive"" and ""sentimental"" matter. However, the contesting parties were hesitant to support the suggestion made by the then bench, which also comprised Justices D Y Chandrachud and S K Kaul. The matter later came up for hearing before a bench, headed by his successor Justice Dipak Mishra, which tried to take forward the appeals against the 2010 Allahabad high court judgment delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land in Ayodhya be partitioned equally among the three parties -- the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla. Justice Misra, the then chief justice along with Justices Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer, had refused to refer the matter before a five-judge Constitution Bench and had treated it as case of title dispute over a property. The idea of settling the dispute through mediation as suggested by a bench headed by Justice Khehar was revived by a bench headed by present Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi. While several developments connected with the dispute, including the recusal of judges like Justices U U Lalit and N V Ramana, delayed the proceedings, the bench headed by Justice Gogoi on February 26 sprang a surprise by toing the suggestion mooted by the apex court in March 2017. The current bench, also comprising Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer on February 26, 2019, again asked the contesting parties to explore the possibility of amicably settling the decades old dispute through mediation, saying it may help in ""healing relations"". Even if there is ""one per cent chance"" of settling the dispute amicably, the parties should go for mediation, the bench had suggested. Besides the judicial intervention, the 1994 judgement in the Ismail Faruqui case had recorded negotiations between VHP and All India Babri Masjid Action Committee, which broke down at a crucial phase. In 2003, the Kanchi Shankaracharya tried for a negotiated settlement. It ended after his July 1, 2003 letter to AIMPLB saying Kashi, Mathura and Ayodhya will have to be given to Hindus at ""some time or other"".

 Ayodhya dispute mediation panel fails to find solution: Key points | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed mediation panel on Thursday said it was unable to arrive at a solution to the 2.77-acre Babri Masjid-Ram Janmoabhoomi land dispute issue in Ayodhya. The court will begin hearing the matter from Friday (August 2). The mediation panel The SC had in March appointed a three-member panel to find an amicable solution to the Ayodhya dispute. The panel comprises Supreme Court justice F M Ibrahim Kalifulla, Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravishankar and senior advocate Sriram Panchu. On Thursday, the panel conveyed to the SC that it had failed to strike a consensus among parties for a negotiated settlement. The mediation panel was formed by the apex court when it was hearing petitions seeking a review of the Allahabad high court verdict on September 30, 2010. The HC verdict had ordered the disputed 2.77 acres to be divided into three equal parts among the Nirmohi Akhara sect, Sunni Central Wakf Board, Uttar Pradesh, and Ramlalla Virajman, but the verdict was challenged by all three parties. A bench of Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazir will hear the appeals challenging the HC verdict from today. Mediation, in spite of objectionsThe Constitution Bench, while hearing the case said that even if there is a “one percent chance” of settling the dispute amicably, the parties should go for it. Not everyone was happy with the idea of mediation. The Uttar Pradesh government, and other Hindu bodies barring the Nirmohi Akhara had opposed the mediation, while Muslim bodies supported the proposal for a negotiated settlement. The Supreme Court instructed the mediation committee to conduct in-camera proceedings in Faizabad. The committee was given eight weeks, which was further extended. During the 155-day long negotiation process that began on March 8 this year, the panel held numerous meetings with parties and persons linked to the dispute despite firm position from Hindu parties. On July 18, the SC gave the panel a fortnight's time to make a last-ditched attempt for a negotiated settlement, which failed to make headway. Why mediationThe Civil Procedure Code clearly states that judges must ensure that all avenues are exhausted to resolve a case outside the court. Section 89, states, “where it appears to the Court that there exist elements of a settlement which may be acceptable to the parties, the Court shall formulate the terms of settlement and give them to the parties for their observations.” Not the first attemptThere have been at least 10 previous attempts of mediation (including one before the Babri Masjid demolition in December 1992) that failed to find a solution. At least three were initiated by India's prime ministers (Chandra Shekhar, PV Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee), one proposed by Chief Justice of India (J S Khehar in 2017), three by the litigants in the case (Mohammed Hashim Ansari, the oldest litigant in the case and retired bureaucrat Ramesh Chandra Tripathi) and three by spiritual leaders (Jayendra Saraswati, Dalai Lama, Ravi Shankar) and Hindu and Muslim organisations. The Allahabad high court also attempted to resolve the legal tussle with its judgment of September 30, 2010. However, none of them were court-monitored as the latest one. Ayodhya mediation fails, Supreme Court to fix daily hearing scheduleThe caseIt pertains to the ownership of over 2.77 acres of land in Ayodhya, where the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi disputed structure stood since 1528 till its demolition on December 6, 1992. In 2010, Allahabad HC divided the disputed land equally among three parties - Ram Lalla, Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Waqf Board. In May 2011, the Supreme Court stayed that verdict. There are 16 appeals and petitions by Hindu and Muslim parties that challenge the Allahabad HC’s verdict, saying a three-way division of the disputed land is not the solution. Parties in the caseThe main parties to the case are the Nirmohi Akhara, Ram Lalla (represented by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad-run Ram Janmabhoomi Trust) and the Sunni Waqf Board.

A five-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, had on July 11 sought a report on the issue and said that a day-to-day hearing may commence from July 25 if the court decides to conclude the mediation proceedings. The bench had requested former apex court judge Justice (Retd) F M I Kalifulla, chairperson of the three-member mediation panel, to apprise it by July 18 the progress of mediation till date and its present stage. ""It will be convenient to have the said report latest by July 18, on which date further orders will be passed by this court,"" the bench, also comprising justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer, had said on July 11. It passed the order while hearing an application filed by a legal heir of one of the original litigants, Gopal Singh Visharad, seeking a judicial decision on the dispute and conclusion of the mediation process, alleging that nothing much was happening there. It had said that the court would pass appropriate orders on July 18 after perusing the report filed by the mediation committee. The panel, also comprising spiritual guru and founder of the Art of Living foundation Sri Sri Ravishankar and senior advocate and renowned mediator Sriram Panchu, was earlier granted time till August 15 by the apex court for completion of mediation after its earlier report had said that the mediators were ""optimistic"" about an amicable solution. The top court had fixed the seat for the mediation process in Faizabad of Uttar Pradesh, around 7 km from Ayodhya, and said adequate arrangements, including those related to the venue of the mediation, place of stay of the mediators, their security and travel, should be arranged forthwith by the state government so that the proceedings could commence immediately. The bench was earlier told by Hindu bodies, except the Nirmohi Akhara, and the Uttar Pradesh government that they were not in favour of the court's suggestion for mediation. The Muslim bodies had supported the proposal. Fourteen appeals have been filed in the apex court against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment, delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land in Ayodhya be partitioned equally among the three parties -- the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla.

 ‘Mediation on Ayodhya won’t yield result’ | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Claiming that the court-mandated mediation for amicable settlement of the vexed Ayodhya dispute is “not likely to yield any result”, one of the parties representing the Hindu community on Tuesday sought scrapping of the process and pleaded the Supreme Court to adjudicate the case pending since 2010. Senior advocate P S Narasimha, appearing for litigant Rajendra Singh, mentioned the petition before a bench headed by CJI Ranjan Gogoi which has agreed to hear the plea. The plea bases its view on the alleged futility of mediation on the experience of the litigant participating in the process which, he said, does not seem to be going anywhere. On March 8, a five-judge bench of the apex court had appointed a three-member panel headed by retired SC judge F M I Kalifulla and comprising renowned mediator and senior advocate Sriram Panchu and spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. It had asked the panel to get opposing parties to the negotiating table to try and resolve the 70-year-old litigation relating to ownership of the 2.77 acre Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land in Ayodhya. The court had in May extended the time till August 15 for the panel to complete proceedings. The petitioner is a successor to one of the litigants who had initiated the legal battle way back in 1950 by filing a case before a civil judge for permission to worship the deity at Ayodhya. Singh argued that he is now about 80 years old himself and is still awaiting the final outcome of the litigation instituted by his father Gopal Singh Visharad. “Since the mediation proceedings ordered by this court are not yielding any fruitful result or likely to yield any result, it is most respectfully submitted that mediation proceedings be declared to have been concluded and the appeals filed by the applicant herein and others be heard on merit and decided expeditiously,” the application said. The plea said suggestions had been made that are not even within the scope of the present mediation in any way and were political in nature. “This has convinced the applicant herein that mediation would not yield any fruitful result and the only solution is judicial adjudication,” the application said. “It is most respectfully submitted that despite initial reluctance in the process of mediation, the applicant herein whole heartedly participated in the mediation proceedings conducted by three eminent persons appointed by this court,” Singh said. He said the meetings over five months have not resulted in any concrete proposal nor has any headway been made in the process of mediation. The appeal, challenging the Allahabad HC decision to divide the 2.77 acre disputed land equally among Ram Lalla (deity), Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Wakf Board, has been pending in the SC since 2010.

The panel, which also comprised spiritual guru and founder of Art of Living foundation Sri Sri Ravishankar and senior advocate and renowned mediator Sriram Panchu, had told the apex court that it was ""optimistic"" about an amicable solution to the politically sensitive dispute. ""If the mediators are optimistic about the result and are seeking time till August 15, what is the harm in granting time? This issue has been pending for years and years. Why should we not grant time,"" the bench had said. The apex court had on March 8 referred the matter to the panel of mediators for exploring possibility of an amicable settlement. In its March 8 order, the top court had asked the panel of mediators to hold in-camera proceedings and complete them within eight weeks. The top court had fixed the seat for mediation process in Faizabad of Uttar Pradesh, around seven km from Ayodhya, and said adequate arrangements including the venue of the mediation, place of stay of the mediators, their security, travel should be forthwith arranged by the state government so that proceedings could commence immediately. The bench was told earlier by Hindu bodies, except for Nirmohi Akhara, and the Uttar Pradesh government that they oppose the court's suggestion for mediation. The Muslim bodies had supported the proposal. Fourteen appeals have been filed in the apex court against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment, delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land in Ayodhya be partitioned equally among the three parties -- the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla.

" Govt subverting constitutional rights, says TMC | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: After a bitter electoral battle in West Bengal, Trinamool Congress hit out at BJP with debutant MP Mahua Moitra in LS and Derek O'Brien in RS accusing the ruling side of undermining constitutional rights and ignoring dangerous signs of xenophobic nationalism. Moitra fought off interruptions from the treasury benches and said while NDA was to be congratulated for gaining a big mandate, there was a need to protect and claim opposition space to ensure a balance in the political debate. In the upper House, O'Brien cited examples of advisories sent by the Centre to West Bengal on law and order matters that fall in the states' domain. He raised concern over the alleged reduction of centrally-sponsored schemes and ""neglect"" of non-BJP ruled states while approving railway projects. He asked why such missives were not sent to UP where around 25 people, including Muslims, have been killed this year or to Bihar in the wake of death of more than 150 children due to AES outbreak. BJP MP Swapan Dasgupta, however, hit back, detailing political violence in West Bengal during the LS polls as well as the ""subversion"" of local body elections in the state which resulted in no-contest in 37% of seats.  In her maiden speech, Moitra said, ""The House belongs to the opposition and I stand today to reclaim this inch that has been guaranteed to us."" She said the ruling side was bothered about 2.77 acres of land - an allusion to the Ayodhya dispute - while the rest of the country had needs that required urgent attention.

"PM Modi visits Ayodhya, gives Ram Lalla a miss - Times of India","The Sangh Parivar may have been very vocal on the Ramjanmabhoomi issue in the past five years, but PM Narendra Modi gave a miss to having a ‘darshan’ of Ram Lalla when he went to Ayodhya to address a rally on Wednesday. While the poll stop this time was Ayodhya’s Gosaiganj area, part of the neighbouring Ambedkarnagar seat, in 2014 too, Modi hadn’t visited the Ramjanmabhoomi site when he was in the area to canvass in Faizabad. Although Modi and the only other man to have been a BJP PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, never visited the site while in office, Congress PM Rajiv Gandhi had kickstarted his campaign for re-election in 1989 from Ramjanmabhoomi. Just prior to that, his government had allowed VHP and the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas to perform shilanyas for the proposed temple. “Gandhi was at that time defending his government from an all-round onslaught over the Bofors scam and other corruption charges. He thought of cashing in on the burning Ram temple issue and tried to snatch the initiative from VHP and BJP, who were running the movement. Besides, it was also a balancing act on his part after his government was accused of Muslim appeasement in view of its stand in the Shah Bano case,” said a political analyst. So, after an Ayodhya court ordered the locks to be opened at Ramjanmabhoomi, Rajiv allowed VHP to perform a puja and decided to launch his campaign from there. Speaking after the puja, he promised to bring ‘Ram Rajya’. However, this thrust on Hindutva didn’t work and the VP Singh-led Janata Dal ousted Congress from office, forming a coalition with support from both BJP and the Left parties.

There is ""no connection"" between the mediation proceedings in the Ayodhya land dispute matter and the release of the film, the Supreme Court said when the matter was mentioned before it for urgent listing. Hours later, the Delhi High Court hearing a separate petition on the issue also decided not to come in the way of the release of the film saying there was no material on record to support the allegations that the movie has the potential to promote communal disharmony. ""This court has not found anything objectionable in it,"" the high court said.

The counsel, who mentioned the plea for urgent listing, said the exhibition of the film should be stayed as it would affect the ongoing mediation proceedings in the Ayodhya matter which have commenced following the apex court's order. The lawyer said that release of the film would vitiate the mediation proceedings in the case.

It also gave liberty to the petitioner to approach it again if he found any objectionable dialogue or scene in the movie.

 ‘Mediation will further delay final judgment’ | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Citing failed mediation attempts in the past and time buying intent behind some parties to the Ayodhya dispute backing negotiations, a senior government functionary expressed scepticism about the SC-directed exercise to find a negotiated settlement. “We have had several examples when attempts of an out of court settlement in the Ayodhya title suit failed. There are several stakeholders and there was no consensus on all occasions. We have no idea what made the SC think about mediation, which will further delay the final judgment,” a senior BJP leader said.

All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, “Congress has unequivocally maintained that the decision of the SC in the Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid case should be final and binding on all parties. So, we respect the decision for constituting a mediation panel by the SC.” While in keeping with its oft-repeated stance on the issue, Congress appeared relieved that the sensitive dispute would return to the political discourse only after the 2019 elections. For a year since the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) affiliates stepped on the gas and sought a day to day hearing of the title suit, the anti-BJP opposition has been concerned that revival of Ayodhya debate during the polls would give the ruling party an unfair advantage since it has the potential to effect religious polarisation which suits the saffron camp. Targeting the BJP, the AICC said, “Since 1992, BJP has kept the issue alive so as to be used in every election for political vote garnering and relegate the Ram Mandir issue to the annals of history post election — to be revived again in the next election.

Panchu, who got a bachelor’s degree in economics from Bombay’s Elphinstone College in 1973, enrolled as an advocate in 1976 after a law degree from Government Law College in the same city. He was designated senior advocate in 1996 and is founder member and vice-president of Association of Indian Mediators and has trained more than 500 mediators. His skills are being utilised in the SC-mandated mediation between Assam and Nagaland over the 50-year-old boundary dispute between the states but his skills will face a newer and stiffer test when he takes up the freshly assigned task of mediation in Ayodhya dispute. A successful lawyer, Panchu withdrew his consent to becoming a judge of Madras HC in 2003 because of the delay intrinsic to the process of selection through the collegium system. Speaking to TOI, Panchu said, “I will meet and speak with other mediators and attempt to come to grips with the main issues of the dispute. It is a very serious responsibility given to me by the SC. I will do my best.” Panchu played a key role in saving Ram Sethu in the Gulf of Mannar from being dredged under the UPA government’s Sethu Samudram project.

" Unhappy over order, BJP politicians say temple only way out of impasse | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: BJP was clearly unhappy with the Supreme Court sending the Ayodhya dispute for mediation with several leaders making it clear on Friday that building a Ram temple at the disputed site was the only way out of the impasse. Union minister Uma Bharati said one has to respect the Supreme Court order but asserted that she stands for building the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and a mosque can be built only outside its vicinity. BJP general secretary P Muralidhar Rao said keeping the dispute pending for long was not in anyone’s interest. “It is important to resolve the issue but it is more important and essential to build a grand temple at Sri Ram Janmabhoomi. This cannot be kept pending for a long time,” he said. BJP MP Subramanian Swamy stressed that construction of the temple was non-negotiable. “There is no question of not building a temple where we believe Lord Ram was born,” he added. Union minister Giriraj Singh said he had no comments to offer but asked Muslims “not to be obstinate” as he pitched for building the temple. “Can there be anything other than a mosque in Mecca and Medina? Do Hindus have not even this much right after partition that we can offer prayers to Lord Ram in Ayodhya?” he asked. Swamy said the court’s decision was welcome but claimed that the mediation panel would have to “map the problem within the parameters so far set by the apex court starting from its 1994 constitutional bench judgment and ending with the three-judge verdict of September 27, 2018” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Supreme Court not viewing Ayodhya as priority: RSS | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Friday expressed surprise at the Supreme Court sending the Ayodhya dispute for mediation and said the top court was not viewing it as a “priority” case. “In Ram Janmabhoomi case, instead of accelerating the judicial process to end the long drawn dispute, the Supreme Court has taken a surprising stand. That the Supreme Court should find no priority for this sensitive subject associated with deep faith of Hindu society is beyond understanding,” the RSS said in a statement at its Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha in Gwalior. “We are experiencing that Hindus are constantly being neglected. While having full respect in the judicial system, we would like to say emphatically that the judgment on the dispute must be expedited and remove the obstacles in constructing a grand temple,” it added. The RSS lauded the IAF for hitting terror launch pads in Pakistan and also praised the government for taking the decision. “The government has taken the right decision to deal with anti-national forces and Indians should also remain cautious of such elements,” RSS joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya told reporters. Around 1,400 members of the Pratinidhi Sabha, including RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is taking part in the meeting. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

They reiterated that justice should be delivered on the basis of the legal position and not on grounds of faith. AIMPLB general secretary Maulana Mohammad Wali Rahmani told TOI that they would support the mediation process by putting across their viewpoint before the court-appointed panel. “In the past, when the Supreme Court asked parties to the case to resolve the matter through mediation, the SC did not get involved in the process.

 Respect SC decision to form mediation panel on Ayodhya dispute: Congress | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Congress Friday said it respects the decision of the Supreme Court to refer the politically-sensitive Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case for mediation, and added that it should be final and binding on all parties. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused the BJP of politicising the ""faith-based issue for political gains for the past 27 years"". ""Since 1992, BJP has kept the issue alive so as to be used in every election for political vote garnering and relegate the Ram Mandir issue to the annals of history post-election -- to be revived again in the next election. We sincerely hope that people of India will see through the duplicity and doublespeak of BJP,"" he said. In a statement, Surjewala said, ""The Congress has unequivocally maintained that the decision of the Supreme Court in the Ram Mandir case should be final & binding on all parties. We respect the decision to constitute a mediation panel."" Giving another chance for mediation, the Supreme Court Friday ordered setting up a three-member panel headed by a former apex court judge F M I Kalifulla to explore a possible settlement of the decades-old politically sensitive Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute in Ayodhya. Spiritual guru and founder of Art of Living Foundation Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and senior advocate Sriram Panchu, well known for his mediation experience, will be the other two members of the panel. Interestingly, all the three men appointed by the apex court hail from Tamil Nadu where the Ayodhya dispute does not have much resonance. The mediation process in Faizabad of Uttar Pradesh, around 7 km from the twin city of Ayodhya, will commence within a week and the panel will submit a progress report within four weeks, the top court said in its order that came ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.

 AIMPLB hails SC's mediation directive on Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Friday welcomed the Supreme Court referring the vexed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case for mediation, saying it would be most befitting that the matter is resolved through negotiations. ""The Supreme Court has given this order and it needs to be welcomed.... It would be most befitting that the matter is resolved through dialogue...let's see what happens now,"" AIMPLB general secretary Maulana Wali Rehmani told PTI over phone. Welcoming the apex court asking for ""utmost confidentiality"" to ensure the success of the mediation process and barring the media from reporting about the proceedings, Rehmani said this would not only prevent distortion of the deliberations but also act as a deterrent against taking the BJP-RSS agenda forward. A senior member of the AIMPLB and the convenor of the Babri Masjid Action Committee, Zafaryab Jilani, said he was ready for this and welcomed the move. Mahant Ram Das of the Nirmohi Akhara, one of the main litigants in the case, too welcomed the setting up of a panel of mediators, but said it would have been better had a Hindu judge, connected with the case, been included in it. He added that besides the mediation efforts, the court hearing in the matter should also go on simultaneously so as to see that the case does not get prolonged further if the litigants are not satisfied. ""Earlier also, some efforts on this line had been made, but to no avail...therefore, the hearing should also go on,"" he stressed. Mahant Ram Das also said the seers of Ayodhya needed to agree to this move. Meanwhile, spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravishankar, who is in the panel of mediators set up by the apex court, said he wanted a happy ending to the long-standing dispute. In a tweet, he said, "".... Respecting everyone, turning dreams to reality, ending long-standing conflicts happily and maintaining harmony in society -- we must all move together towards these goals.""

Ram Mandir news: Will Ayodhya dispute go for mediation? Supreme Court order today | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court will pass its order on Friday on whether the more than 70-year-old litigation over Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid disputed land in   Ayodhya should be referred for a mediated settlement.  Mediated settlement would be the preferred solution to the vexed issue, the SC had said on Wednesday, adding that it was not merely a litigation over a piece of land but a matter relating to hearts, minds and faith of a large swathe of the population. Sending the issue for resolution through mediation will be a brave decision on the part of the bench comprising CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer as the Hindu parties have stoutly opposed the move and called it a futile exercise. Ayodhya land dispute: Supreme Court reserves order on mediationIn response to the SC’s proposition to the parties to suggest names of mediators, the Muslim parties and Nirmohi Akhara had separately submitted names. But the Hindu parties stuck to their stand that they were opposed to mediation and did not offer any names. Four earlier attempts to find a solution to the dispute through mediation had failed, the first being in the 1990s when talks between Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Babri Masjid Action Committee broke down at a crucial stage. The second and most significant effort for a negotiated settlement was made by the Kanchi Shankaracharya in 2003. However, it broke down after his July 1, 2003, letter to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board which said, “Kashi, Mathura and Ayodhya, all three belong to Hindus and keeping in mind the larger interest of the country and communal harmony, if not today, but at some time or other, these places have to be given to the Hindus. The Muslims have to mentally prepare themselves for this.” The third attempt fizzled out soon after then CJI J S Khehar in March 2017 suggested that he or another SC judge would be more than willing to become the mediator to bring the warring sides to the negotiating table. In the later half of 2017, attempts by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Shia Wakf Board chairman Waseem Rizvi too failed to yield any result.

Ram Mandir news: Supreme Court stays firm on seeking compromise on Ayodhya | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared resolute in taking the mediation route to explore the possibility, no matter however slim, of a compromise between Hindu and Muslim parties warring for ownership of the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land in Ayodhya as it asked parties to suggest names of mediators. With Hindu parties, except Nirmohi Akhara, opposing mediation and Muslim parties expressing willingness, a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer reserved its verdict on desirability of mediation for the land dispute and told the parties, “Give names of mediators by today. We will pass orders shortly.” With the Hindu parties steadfast in opposing mediation, terming it a futile exercise, Justice Bobde said, “You are pre-judging it. We are trying for mediation because it is not about a land dispute but involves sentiments and faith of people. We are conscious of the gravity and importance of the dispute and its impact on the body polity of the country. It is all about mind, heart and feelings. We cannot understand how anyone can reject it outright.” Appearing for the UP government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Apart from legality of the course of action (mediation), when one side is not ready, there is an element of ‘advisability’ and ‘judicial prudence’ in Section 89 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) itself. It is absolutely unadvisable and judicially imprudent to send this issue to mediation considering the very nature of the issues involved. The best and only advisable course of action is earliest judicial adjudication.” When the Hindu parties said Babur had demolished the temple and it was the belief of people that Lord Ram was born there, which could not be settled through negotiations, Justice Bobde said, “We have also read history and about Babur. We have no control over the past. We can only do something about what exists in the present, that is the dispute.” The court said there should be absolute secrecy around the mediation process as third-party comments based on media reports could unhinge the effort. “Media need not talk about what efforts are going on and what developments have taken place. We are considering whether it should be reported at all. It will not be a gag order but there should be confidentiality of the mediation process,” Justice Bobde said. However, Justice Chandrachud said it could be difficult to ensure secrecy of the mediation process. He also wondered whether in the event of reaching a compromise, it could be binding on the public, who are not parties to the case. Appearing for Muslim parties, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan said there was no difference between court adjudicated verdict or a compromise which would result in a decree. Both would be binding on the parties, Dhavan said, who is an eternal advocate of free speech. On secrecy of the mediation process, Dhavan, ordinarily a passionate free speech votary, said he would go one step further to suggest that it should be contempt of court if anyone reported about developments in the mediation process. Dhavan and counsel Ejaz Maqbool said the SC did not require consent of parties for sending a dispute for mediation but requested the court not to outline the framework settlement. He said original records of the entire Ayodhya land dispute litigation need not be placed before mediators and the process must be in-camera with the rider that no party participating in mediation can divulge details to media or anyone. Appearing for deity Ram Lalla, senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan said the only dispute that could be sent for mediation was where could a mosque be builty. “Ayodhya is Ram Janmabhoomi and that is non-negotiable. Temple at Ramjanmabhoomi is non-negotiable. I cannot participate in mediation and take a contrary view,” he said. Hindu Mahasabha, through advocate Barun Sinha, supported Vaidyanathan. He told TOI later that he would not be suggesting any names for mediation. Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for a Hindu party, supported early judicial adjudication of the appeals against the Allahabad HC’s 2010 verdict, which divided the disputed land equally among three parties — Ram Lalla, Sunni Wakf Board and Nirmohi Akhara.

 SC to hear Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case on Tuesday | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Tuesday Ayodhya's Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute matter. It will be heard by a five-judge constitution bench comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and justices SA Bobde, DY Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer. The apex court had on January 27 cancelled the scheduled hearing for January 29 as Justice Bobde was not available that day. Fourteen appeals have been filed in the apex court against the 2010 Allahabad high court judgment, delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land in Ayodhya be partitioned equally among the three parties - the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla. The five-judge bench was re-constituted on January 25 as Justice UU Lalit, who was a member of the earlier bench, had recused himself from hearing the matter. When the new bench was constituted, Justice NV Ramana was excluded from the re-constituted bench. Justices Bhushan and Nazeer, who were included in the newly constituted bench, were part of an earlier bench headed by then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra (now retired) which had heard the Ayodhya land dispute matter. The three-judge bench had on September 27, 2018 refused to refer to a five-judge constitution bench the issue related to reconsideration of the observation in the apex court's 1994 judgment that a mosque was not integral to Islam. While Misra and Justice Bhushan had said it has to find out the context in which the five-judge bench had delivered the 1994 judgment, Justice Nazeer had given a minority verdict disagreeing with the two judges. Justice Nazeer had said whether a mosque is integral to Islam has to be decided considering religious belief which requires detailed consideration. On January 10, Justice Lalit had recused himself after expressing disinclination to participate in the hearing any further as he had appeared as a lawyer for former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh in a related matter ""sometime in the year 1997"". Along with the main matters, the constitution bench will also hear the connected issues raised in separate petitions. The Centre had on January 29 moved the apex court seeking its nod to return the 67-acre undisputed acquired land around the disputed site to original owners. The 0.313 acre plot, on which the disputed structure stood before it was demolished by 'kar sevaks' on December 6, 1992, was within the 2.77-acre disputed premises, the plea filed by the government had said. The government had then acquired 67.703 acres, including the 2.77-acre plot, through a legislation in 1993. The Ram Janambhoomi Nyas (RJN) is the owner of as much as 42 acres of the acquired non-disputed land. The Centre's plea has said that the RJN (a trust to promote construction of Ram Temple) had also sought return of excess land acquired, to original owners. The Centre has claimed that only 0.313 acre of land was disputed on which the structure stood before it was demolished by 'kar sevaks' on December 6, 1992. It has sought modification in its 2003 order and permission to return to original owners the 67 acres ""non-disputed"" land around the disputed structure in Ayodhya. A week after, another petition was filed challenging the constitutional validity of a 1993 central law by which the government acquired 67.703 acres of land, including the disputed premises of Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid, in Ayodhya. The petition, filed by seven individuals, including two Lucknow-based lawyers claiming to be devotees of Ram Lalla, has contended that Parliament had no legislative competence to acquire land belonging to the state. Moreover, it said, the state legislature has the exclusive power to make provisions relating to the management of affairs of religious institutions inside its territory. The petitioners, including lawyers Shishir Chaturvedi and Sanjay Mishra, submitted that the Acquisition of Certain Areas of Ayodhya Act, 1993 infringes upon the right to religion of Hindus guaranteed and protected under Article 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) of the Constitution. The plea has sought the court's direction restraining the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government from interfering in ""Puja, Darshan and performance of rituals at the places of worship situated within the land admeasuring 67.703 acres acquired under the Act particularly at the land belonging to Shri Ram Janam Bhoomi Nyas, Manas Bhavan, Sankat Mochan Mandir, Ram Janmasthan Temple, Janki Mahal and Katha Mandap"". It also said that the law, by which the entire disputed and adjoining undisputed land was acquired, violated the freedom of the Hindus to practise their fundamental religious rights under Article 25 of the Constitution.

In accordance with the prescheduled programme of foundation laying in Ayodhya, the symbolic ceremony was held in Varanasi amid religious rituals and chanting of vedic mantras. Shankaracharya put ‘Shri Ram Yantra, four silver bricks and four marble bricks of the sketch on a bif sheet of white paper to perform the ritual. He had earlier announced at Param Dharam Sansad hosted by him at Kumbh on January 30 to carry out Ramagrah Yatra from Prayagraj Kumbh for Ayodhya on February 17 to lay foundation of temple at Ram Janambhumi on February 21.

There is also a piece of 1.75 acres of land, which was disputed. “After the courts’ verdict it was clear that there was no temple at the disputed site. Neither Babar nor his commander Mir Baqi had gone to Ayodhya,” he said. “There is a conspiracy to construct a temple at some distance from the birthplace of Ram. But, we need the temple at the very birthplace of Shri Ram for which no foundation was laid till now,” said the seer adding, “Now we have laid the foundation to construct the temple”.

 SC bench to begin hearing Ayodhya case on Feb 26 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The much-adjourned hearing on politically and religiously sensitive 70-year-old litigation for ownership of disputed 2.77 acres of land in Ayodhya will commence before a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court on February 26, if all goes well. The SC Registry on Friday notified the scheduled commencement of hearing for Tuesday. But many might still keep their fingers crossed over whether the court would be able to keep its date with the matter, considering that due to a variety of reasons — from recusal to indisposition of judges — it had to adjourn the much-awaited hearing several times. Even in the last five months, the appeals against the Allahabad HC’s 2010 judgment dividing the 2.77 acres equally among Ram Lalla, Sunni Wakf Board and Nirmohi Akhara, which have been pending for the last nine years in the SC, had a roller-coaster journey. On September 27 last year, a three-judge bench of then CJI Dipak Misra and Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer by 2-1 majority had rejected the plea of Muslim parties to refer the land dispute to a five-judge bench given its national importance. But CJI Ranjan Gogoi using his administrative powers under the SC rules decided to place the appeals for hearing before a five-judge bench. When the bench of CJI Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, N V Ramana, U U Lalit and D Y Chandrachud assembled on January 10, the Muslim parties pointed out that Justice Lalit, when he was an advocate, had appeared for a party in a case related to Babri Masjid demolition case. This triggered Justice Lalit’s immediate recusal from hearing of the case. By the time the bench was reconstituted and notified on January 25, Justice Ramana, too, had opted out of hearing. In place of Justices Ramana and Lalit, the CJI drafted in Justices Bhushan and Nazeer into the five-judge Constitution bench and scheduled hearing for January 29. But on January 27, the Supreme Court issued a circular intimating parties about cancellation of scheduled January 29 hearing because of indisposition of Justice Bobde, who had suffered a hair-line fracture in a minor accident at home. On January 29, the Centre moved the Supreme Court seeking permission to return all land surrounding the core disputed Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid structure, which it estimated to be only 0.313 acre, to the original owners. The Centre’s application, based on observations by the Supreme Court in Ismail Faruqui judgment of 1994, said it would provide a plan while returning the land to original owners so as to make provision for entry and exit to the core disputed site. Certain persons, claiming to be devotees of Lord Ram moved the apex court a few days later challenging the 1993 Ayodhya land acquisition law claiming that Constitution provided the power of land acquisition only to the state governments and not to the Centre. Supreme Court has agreed to hear both pleas along with the main appeals.

It also said that the law, by which the entire disputed and adjoining undisputed land was acquired, violated the freedom of the Hindus to practise their fundamental religious rights under Article 25 of the Constitution.

 SC to hear Ram devotees’ plea on Ayodhya land | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a petition filed by persons claiming to be devotees of Lord Ram challenging the Centre’s decision to acquire nearly 70 acres at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site. A bench headed by CJI Ranjan Gogoi said the petition challenging the validity of ‘Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act, 1993’on the ground that the Centre could not have acquired the land, which vested exclusively with the Uttar Pradesh government, would be heard along with the main petition seeking ownership of the 2.77 acre core disputed land, which has been referred to a five-judge bench. The petitioners, led by Lucknow-based advocate Shishir Chaturvedi, challenged the acquisition of 2.77 acre core disputed area and the surrounding 67.07 acres and said under Article 294 of the Constitution, the land and properties situated in Uttar Pradesh vested in the state government and the Union of India could not take over any part of the land and property situated in Ayodhya. The SC on October 24, 1994, in Ismail Faruqui case had repelled challenges to the validity of the 1993 Ayodhya Act and said, “Obviously, the acquisition of any religious place is to be made only in unusual and extraordinary situations for a larger national purpose keeping in view that such acquisition should not result in extinction of the right to practise the religion, if the significance of that place be such. Subject to this condition, the power of acquisition is available for a mosque like any other place of worship of any religion.” Appearing for Muslim parties, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan opposed the petition and said it was a plea for review of the 1994 Ismail Faruqui judgment and argued that no review petition could be maintainable after 25 years. However, just seven months ago, Dhavan had sought review of the Faruqui judgment on the ground that it had erroneously made a declaration that mosques were not essential for offering of namaz by Muslims. The Centre had recently moved the SC with an application seeking permission to return the superfluous land to its original owners after identifying that the core area requiring determination of ownership was only .313 acres, the plinth area of the three-domed Babri Masjid structure which was demolished on December 6, 1992.

" Illegal migrants are SP, BSP vote bank: Shah | India News - Times of India","MAHARAJGANJ/JAUNPUR: BJP president Amit Shah on Friday called illegal migrants a vote bank of the SP and the BSP and also targeted the opposition over the issues of triple talaq and the Ayodhya dispute. He said “every single intruder” will be sent home if the BJP returns to power. Shah said the party remained committed to the construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and challenged the opposition parties to spell out their own stands on the issue. He was addressing booth-level party workers in Maharajganj and later in Jaunpur, in a series of such interactions in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections. In Jaunpur, he brought up the surgical strike against militant camps in Pakistan-held territory in 2016. ""When army personnel came back after avenging the death of their colleagues, there was a major change globally as there are only two countries which have avenged the death of their army personnel -- Israel and United States,” he said. “India was included in that category because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" he said. Raising the issue of illegal migrants from Bangladesh, he said in Maharajganj, ""Should the intruders not be thrown out of the country?” He said the recent exercise on the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam had identified 40 lakh such people, “and the process of throwing them out has started”. ""If UP elects the Narendra Modi government again in 2019, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Assam to Gujarat, from Uttar Pradesh to Uttarakhand, every single intruder will be ousted,” he said. ""These intruders may be a vote bank for ""bua” and “bhatija”,” Shah said, referring to alliance partners Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav. “For us, it is national security that is most important."" He referred to Congress women wing chief Sushmita Dev remark Thursday that the party will scrap the triple talaq law if it comes to power, and asked, ""Should Muslim women and girls not get their rights?” “Every woman in the country has the right to her dignity and Modi will give this right to Muslim women as well,"" Shah said. The Bharatiya Janata Party chief said all BJP workers want to know the party's stand on the Ram temple. ""I want to make it clear that the BJP is committed to building a grand Ram temple at the same place at the earliest,"" he said. He charged that the Congress wanted the Ayodhya land case taken up only after the elections. He said the faith of crores of people was attached to the case, and asked the Congress, “Whom do you want to appease?"" ""I have said here that the BJP is committed to the Ram temple's construction, but I want to ask bua-bhatija and Rahul baba to clear their parties' stand on it,” he said, throwing a challenge at UP's opposition alliance and the Congress. “If they do not want it, they should clearly tell the people. Whatever their stand is, the BJP will get a grand temple built there,"" he said. Shah recalled that the Centre has moved the Supreme Court seeking permission to return the uncontested land adjacent to the disputed site to its original owners. He referred to Congress women wing chief Sushmita Dev remark Thursday that the party will scrap the triple talaq law if it comes to power. ""Should Muslim women and girls not get their rights?” he said. “Every woman in the country has the right to her dignity and Modi will give this right to Muslim women as well,"" Shah said.

" After VHP, RSS puts off temple stir till Lok Sabha polls end | India News - Times of India","DEHRADUN/NEW DELHI: A day after VHP said it will put the Ayodhya agitation on the backburner for the next four months, till the Lok Sabha elections are over, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said the Sangh will take up building of the Ram temple after the polls, irrespective of the colour of the government. During closed-door interactions at the RSS office in Dehradun, Bhagwat responded to several questions ranging from Ram temple and religious discrimination to caste-based reservations. On the temple, Bhagwat reiterated his stand that it will be built as per the “dharma sansad” held at Kumbh recently. But what is of significance is that Bhagwat endorsed the VHP position that the demand will not be pursued at present as it will mire the Ayodhya issue in politicking and become a “petty election issue”. An RSS functionary said, “Bhagwatji said that after the elections, irrespective of which government comes to power, the Sangh, along with religious leaders, would take action.” He added that Bhagwat did not spell out a specific date for building the temple but went on to state that “Ram temple and gau raksha” are the basis of Hindu culture and are must for bringing back the glory of Hindu culture. In its recent resolution, the dharma sansad noted that with the election bugle to be sounded soon, “pseudo-secular” political forces are gathering in full force. “The sant samaj shall not give the pseudo-secular pack the opportunity to drag this holy and important movement of Shri Ramjanmabhoomi into a political vortex and swamp,” it said. On other issues, Bhagwat said he supported reservations but also advocated a broader social outreach. “Bhagwat stated that the RSS is not against reservations but the benefits of reservations must also be made available to all deserving people irrespective of their caste, sect and religion,” said the functionary. The VHP and RSS’s decision to put the Ram temple agitation on hold till the Lok Sabha polls are over is a respite for BJP, which has been in a bind over the slow progress of the dispute in court. The Centre’s decision to move a fresh plea seeking return of all the land acquired post-Babri Masjid demolition — barring a small disputed area where the idol of Ram Lalla has been installed — is seen as a bid to convey the central government’s sincerity towards the temple cause. The VHP decision indicates that a common position has been worked out between BJP, RSS and VHP as regards the temple demand that will give BJP political breathing space ahead of the elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has previously said that the court process will need to play out before any other initiative on the temple can be considered. He was seen to be responding to VHP and RSS demands for an ordinance or legislation. The RSS’s strident support for legislation was seen by insiders as a means of conveying the Sangh’s unflinching backing for the temple to the assembly of sadhus and sants who are spearheading the demand. RSS media head Arun Kumar said sant samaj and those demanding construction of the temple are satisfied with the government decision seeking handover of land around the Ram Lalla idol. He said campaigns for mass awareness will continue, like a programme scheduled for April 6 where “Shriram Jairam” mantra will be chanted in temples across the country. VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal said the resolution was passed to put the agitation plan on hold in light of the Lok Sabha polls when there will be a code of conduct and restrictions in place. “Sant community felt that that there should not be any confrontation,” Bansal said.
