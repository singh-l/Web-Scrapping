" We have changed tactics, bettered drills post Pulwama attack: CRPF DG | India News - Times of India","GURGAON: The CRPF has ""changed"" its tactics and bettered its security drills after the Pulwama terror attack on its convoy that took place almost a year ago, the chief of the force said on Tuesday. CRPF Director General (DG) A P Maheshwari said no one can guarantee that such incidents will not take place in the future owing to the dynamic nature of counter-terror operations. However, his force can assure and ""guarantee"" that terror elements will not have it easy if they have an engagement with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) that has deployed over 70,000 troops for counter-terror operations in the Kashmir valley. ""We are a fighting force. We have bettered our security drills, we have bettered our capability for training, we have bettered in terms of equipment, tactics, mobility and navigation,"" Maheshwari told reporters at a force camp here. ""We have improved. We believe that we learn from setbacks and these should take us towards success. Whatever successes have been there, have emerged out of failure,"" he said. When asked what measures has the CRPF taken over the last year, Maheshwari said the ""adversary keeps trying as also the security forces."" ""I do not say that such incidents will not take place. No body can guarantee that and let us understand that,"" he said. Someone who has done operations knows that guarantee can't be given (against Pulwama type attacks) but we will give guarantee that the possibility that they (terrorists) hit us will not be there and if they even succeed, they will not go alive or we will track their footprints and end the source, the DG said. He said security forces like the CRPF, Jammu and Kashmir Police, National Investigation Agency, Enforcement Directorate and others are working in an ""integrated"" manner in the Kashmir valley to hit at the financial, infrastructure and other roots of terrorist elements. ""So, we all work in an ecosystem... It is not one agency or force that sees a setback or success. It is a holistic perspective,"" he said. ""After the experience of this (Pulwama attack) incident, we have changed our tactics and have changed our capabilities in terms of equipment, training and strategy and consciousness... We have bettered and we will keep doing that,"" the DG said. Forty CRPF personnel were killed when a Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist rammed his explosives-laden vehicle in a convoy of the force on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway near Pulwama on February 14 last year.

" BJP, Congress spar over whether DSP had link to Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday demanded that the government probe whether Jammu and Kashmir police officer Davinder Singh had any role in last year’s Pulwama terror attack, suggesting a political nexus, prompting BJP to hit back demanding that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi explain who was behind the attack if not Pakistan. Singh was posted in Pulwama and Congress’s allegations take into account his name figuring in claims regarding the 2001 Parliament attack and he was also in the frame during the recent visit of foreign envoys to J&K. With Congress claiming a “larger conspiracy”, BJP asked it to explain if it had doubts on who was behind the Pulwama terror attack. “I want to ask Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi if they have any doubt about perpetrators of the Pulwama attack. If you believe Pakistan was not behind it, then you should tell us clearly as to who were involved,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said. Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury sought to target RSS and said, “Had Davinder Singh by default been Davindar Khan, the reaction of troll regiment of RSS would have been more strident and vociferous. Enemies of our country ought to be condemned, irrespective of colour, creed, and religion.” Patra accused Congress of linking religion to terror attacks to target Hindus and said the party had a history of doing so. Congress leaders had invented terms like “saffron terror” and “Hindu terror” and had linked RSS to the Mumbai terror attacks, he said. Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, “For how long has Davinder Singh been acting as a conduit for J&K terrorists? What is his connection, if at all, to the 2001 Parliament attack? What is his connection to the Pulwama attack where over 42 jawans lost their lives and where Singh was DSP?” Congress dismissed the police claim that Singh was bringing two terrorists in his car to Delhi for Rs 12 lakh on January 11. “This story is preposterous. There is a larger conspiracy. At whose instance was Singh bringing terrorists to Delhi? Are there any people in echelons of power who are involved with him? Is there a larger conspiracy, is he only a small pawn or a carrier in the larger conspiracy?” Surjewala asked. Rejecting the Congress charge, Patra said, “Congress is best at attacking India and defending and protecting Pakistan.” Pakistani PM Imran Khan and LeT chief Hafiz Saeed would soon be praising Congress for its statements, he said, recalling that Pakistan had used Rahul’s remarks in its plea in the UN on Article 370.

After the attack carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad in February that killed 40 CRPF personnel, India carried out air strikes against the biggest training camp of the terror group in Balakot in Pakistan. The air strike was followed by an aerial combat between air forces of the two countries on February 27 when Pakistan jets entered India. While chasing Pakistani jet an Indian Air Force jet crashed in Pakistan occupied Kashmir following which its injured pilot was captured. Pakistan quickly announced to release the Indian pilot, who was subsequently handed over to India. At the height of the Indo-Pak tensions, China sent its vice foreign minister Kong Xuanyou to Pakistan to counsel restraint from Islamabad. In an interview to the ruling Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, the People's Daily, about China's diplomatic achievements in 2019, Wang mentioned post-Pulwama tensions and Beijing's attempts to bring peace between India and Pakistan. ""During the India-Pakistan conflict, China supported the efforts of the two sides to defuse tensions and manage differences through dialogue,"" Wang said, without directly referring to the Pulwama attack and the aftermath. The transcript of his interview was circulated to media on Tuesday by the Chinese foreign ministry here. Also, Wang mentioned the 2nd informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in October at the top of highlights of the Chinese diplomacy in the neighbourhood, saying the meeting helped the two sides to charter the course for the steady growth of their ties. ""There are many highlights in China's neighbourhood diplomacy this year,"" he said. ""First, we have improved and developed relations with our neighbours in an all-round way. President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a successful second summit in Chennai and charted the course for the steady growth of China-India relations,"" he said. Earlier at a symposium on China's diplomacy in 2019 held here on December 13, Wang said the Chennai summit had set the tone for a steady and sound development of ties between India and China. Over the past year, China has comprehensively strengthened relations with neighbouring countries and made positive contributions, promoting regional stability and development, Wang said, while highlighting China's diplomatic outreach in the neighbourhood. President Xi and Prime Minister Modi held around five-and-half hours of one-on-one talks spread over two days as part of the second informal summit in Chennai. ""The two leaders had a long-term and in-depth strategic communication. They decided to deepen pragmatic cooperation in various fields, promote exchanges and mutual learning between civilisations, and maintain a stable Sino-Indian relationship,"" he said. The two leaders held the first informal summit at Wuhan last year followed up with the one at Chennai this year. They have agreed to hold their third meeting in China next year. At the Chennai summit the two leaders agreed to establish a high-level economic and trade dialogue mechanism with the objective of achieving enhanced trade and commercial relations, especially to address India's trade deficit with China which last year mounted to over US $57 billion in US $95.5 billion total trade between the two countries. They also decided to celebrate 2020 as 'Year of India-China Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges' and hold 70 activities to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of India-China relations. The Chennai summit ""set the tone for the steady and sound development of China-India relations and opened up new prospects for the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,"" Wang said in his address. In his interview to the People's Daily, Wang said China has improved its diplomatic outreach in the neighbourhood. ""On Afghanistan, as part of its shuttle diplomacy, China has facilitated the intra-Afghan dialogue and the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan and the China-Russia-US consultation, and hosted the first China-Russia-US-Pakistan four-party meeting,"" he said. ""China has served as a mediator between Myanmar and Bangladesh to encourage a negotiated solution to their outstanding issues,"" he said, referring to the differences between the two countries over the Rohingya refugees. Wang also spoke about improvement of relations between China and Japan, which in the recent past were affected by tensions over the disputed islands in the East China Sea. ""China and Japan reached a 10-point consensus on improving and growing bilateral ties, giving the relationship a strong momentum to return to the right track,"" he said. China-Asean (Association of SouthEast Asian Nations) also progressed over the disputed South China Sea. China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims. ""China-Asean relations have entered a new stage of all-round development, as evidenced by the important progress made in the consultation on a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and greater stability in the region,"" Wang said.

Pak Army rejects India's claim of destroying terror camps in PoK - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan military has rejected as ""false"" the Indian Army's assertion that it targeted at least three terror camps in PoK and said India is welcome to take any foreign diplomat or media to the site to ""prove"" its claim on ground.

"Imran Khan admits Balakot strike took place, says India planning something even bigger in PoK - Times of India","MUZAFFARABAD (PoK): In an indirect admission that the Balakot was a major operation that rattled Pakistan, country's Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Wednesday that India was planning an even bigger operation in PoK in the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 by New Delhi. ""We have information and we have had two National Security Committee (NSC) meetings. The Pakistan Army has full knowledge that India has made a plan to take action in PoK. Just like how after Pulwama, they took the action in Balakot, according to the information we have, they have made more sinister plans now,"" Khan said while addressing the Legislative Assembly here on the occasion of 73rd Independence Day of Pakistan. In the early morning hours of February 26, the Indian warplanes had crossed over to Pakistan and attacked Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist training camp in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avenge the deadly Pulwama attack. While India had insisted that it killed a large number of JeM group terrorists and destroyed their camp, Pakistan had said that the bombs had landed in an empty area and caused no casualties. More than a month after this claim, Pakistan authorities had allowed a delegation of about a dozen people including foreign media and defence attaches to visit the site in an attempt to prove that nothing of the sort as claimed by India had happened there. In his address on Wednesday, Khan said that the ""hateful ideology"" of the BJP and the RSS would not remain limited to Kashmir, but eventually spill towards Pakistan, following which they would take such action. Khan threatened serious consequences if such an action takes place. ""Our Army is prepared,"" said Khan. ""Not just the army, but the entire nation would fight alongside our military... we will respond to whatever they do,"" said Khan. Oddly, most of Khan's 30-plus minute address on Pakistan's Independence Day was ""devoted"" to attacking the BJP and the RSS. At one point, he even went on to call himself the Ambassador of Kashmir, adding that he would raise the matter on every international forum, and take it to the United Nations as well as the International Court of Justice. ""We will go to the United National. We will go to every global forum, as well as the International Court of Justice. We are mobilising the global community of Kashmiris and you will see a historic number of people coming out,"" he said. Khan said that Pakistan needs to make the world realise that the ideology of the RSS is exactly like Nazis and that the India of today is no more tolerant, plural, or secular as it once was. ""We have to make the world realise that the ideology of the RSS is exactly like the Nazi ideology. After World War II, the world made a collective decision that such genocide would never be repeated. The RSS ideology is heading that way again,"" Khan said. ""This is the ideology that has done ethnic cleansing in the world, that has created wars. People have no idea how much India has radicalised. It is no longer a plural or secular society. The facade of a tolerant India has been removed,"" he added. He went on to say that the goons of the RSS are lynching people, threatening judges, intellectuals, and deeming anyone who speaks against them as anti-nationals, which is ""exactly what the Nazis did. India is heading towards disaster with extremist ideology"". India's historic move has rattled Pakistan, following which it has undertaken a series of decisions, including downgrading bilateral relations with India and suspending bilateral trade, halting Samjhauta and Thar Express trains from its side and banning Indian movies in Pakistani cinemas.

N-deterrence helped de-escalate tensions during Pulwama crisis: Pak official - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Nuclear deterrence led to the de-escalation of tensions during the post-Pulwama military stand-off between India and Pakistan, a senior official associated with Pakistan's nuclear programme said here Friday. Brigadier Zahir Kazmi, director general Arms Control and Disarmament Affairs at Strategic Plans Division (SPD) told journalists that the stated purpose of deterrence was to close space for war and bring states to the negotiating table. ""Stability actually means peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the subcontinent... nuclear deterrence should be a factor of stability between Pakistan and Hindustan,"" The Express Tribune quoted him as saying during a media interaction with senior Pakistani officials dealing with strategic affairs. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the February 14 Pulwama attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) terror group which killed 40 CRPF personnel. Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting a JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The next day, Pakistan air force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured an Indian pilot, who was handed over to India on March 1. Brig Kazmi said deterrence worked during the post-Pulwama military stand-off despite India's attempt to escalate to a different level by talking about mobilisation of nuclear missile and nuclear submarines. He clarified that deterrence was not an end in itself but a psychological state. ""It should inspire fear in which the perceived cost of deterrence breakdown is higher than the desired benefits of preferring war as an instrument for dispute resolution,"" the report quoted him as saying. The director general Arms Control and Disarmament, ministry of foreign affairs, Muhammad Kamran Akhtar said that Pakistan demonstrated a more responsible and restrained behaviour during the standoff that led to de-escalation. He claimed that Pakistan was a responsible and restrained nuclear power and the country's safety and security record was immaculate and an example for many countries. At the media interaction organised by Islamabad Policy Institute, Akhtar dismissed the allegations that Pakistan possessed the fastest growing nuclear programme in the world. Defense analyst Syed Muhammad Ali said Pakistan's nuclear programme had significantly contributed towards meeting both its traditional and non-traditional security needs. Nuclear deterrence, he added, had enabled Pakistan timely manage and de-escalate several regional crises with India during the past three decades. This, he said, also gave Pakistan's leadership and diplomats more confidence in international diplomacy Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."

Kartarpur Sahib is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. The shrine is visible from the Indian side of the border and everyday a larger number of Sikh devotees gather to perform Darshan or sacred viewings of the site. The two sides have continued talks on the corridor despite their recent military standoff after the Pulwama terror attack. Pakistan is hopeful that the landmark corridor will become functional on the 550th birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak in November this year. Qureshi also said Afghanistan remained central to Pakistan's efforts to forge lasting regional stability and consistently called for an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process of dialogue and reconciliation as the only viable way forward. The foreign minister mentioned that as the leadership of SCO member states would meet in June, there was a need to discuss the challenges confronting sustainable growth, environment and collective security. Qureshi also presented a seven-point agenda at the SCO meeting focusing on confidence-building measures among member states including control on weapons race, establishment of joint fund and international framework to combat corruption and crime, Pakistan's official APP news agency reported.

" Lanka, Pulwama attacks made India more determined to resolutely fight terrorism: Sushma Swaraj tells SCO | India News - Times of India","BISHKEK: India on Wednesday said the ghastly bombings in Sri Lanka at a time when the wounds of the Pulwama terror attack were still raw in people's mind has made it more determined to resolutely fight against the menace. Addressing the meeting of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of foreign ministers here in the Kyrgyz capital, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj said India is determined to consistently strengthen cooperation within the SCO framework for comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. ""Our heart goes out to our brothers and sisters of Sri Lanka, who have recently witnessed the ghastly act of terrorism. Our wounds of Pulwama attack were still raw and the news from the neighborhood has made us more determined to resolutely fight against this menace,"" Swaraj said at the meeting, also attended by Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Nine suicide bombers carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and as many luxury hotels on April 21, killing more than 250 people and injuring 500 others. The ISIS terror group claimed the attacks, but the government blamed the local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jammath (NTJ) for the Easter Sunday bombings. The attack came months after India witnessed a suicide attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed on CRPF personnel in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, killing 40 soldiers. Swaraj said India is open to ideas on how we can make the work of Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS), which specifically deals with issues relating to security and defence, more effective. In spite of a turbulent global scenario, SCO member states have been steadily expanding mutually beneficial cooperation in various spheres, including political, security and development, Swaraj said. She said that India is committed to continue working for a favourable environment for the SCO member countries' economic activities and to intensify work on the relevant SCO documents dealing with economic and trade cooperation. ""India subscribes to a rule-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system, centered around the World Trade Organisation, and firmly oppose unilateralism and protectionism,"" she said, amidst the trade war between China and the US. India was an observer at the SCO since 2005 and has generally participated in the ministerial-level meetings of the grouping which focus mainly on security and economic cooperation in the Eurasian region. Along with India, Pakistan was also granted the SCO membership in 2017. The SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the presidents of Russia, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

Right wing activists demand arrest of AMU student suspended for hailing Pulwama attack | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: Right wing activists from Vishwa Hindu Mahasangh (VHM) have demanded the arrest of Aligarh Muslim University’s suspended student, Basim Hilal, who had hailed the Pulwama attack that claimed lives of at least 44 CRPF jawans. Talking to media, city president of VHM, Sandeep Kushwaha, said that he has submitted a memorandum to the SSP demanding Hilal’s arrest. He said that Hilal was allowed by the university to appear for his exams despite the fact that he was suspended. Kushwaha said that while AMU allowed Hilal to appear for the exam, they had not given permission to another suspended student, Ajay Singh, grandson of BJP MLA Dalveer Singh. He said that this showed the biased mindset of the AMU authorities. On Feb 15, Hilal was booked by Aligarh police under IPC’s section 153A (promoting enmity between two different religions) and also section 67 (for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act on the basis of a complaint filed by police media cell in-charge, Govind Ballabh Sharma. Almost a week ago, sitting Member of Parliament (MP) from Aligarh Satish Gautam had raised questions over Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) administration for allowing a Hilal to take exams, while denying such privilege to Hindu students suspended for taking out a ‘Tiranga Yatra’. However, university authorities claimed that Hilal was given a ‘conditional’ permission as the matter of his suspension is still pending before the disciplinary committee. “His answer sheets will be evaluated on the basis of committee’s decision,” said spokesperson of the university, Shafey Kidwai, adding that Ajay will be given permission as per rules and regulations.

Narendra Modi:  PM Modi’s remark on cloud cover registers on opposition’s radar - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Opposition parties led by Congress attacked PM Narendra Modi on Sunday for his remarks that cloud cover “helped” IAF planes evade Pakistani radars during the Balakot strikes, with political leaders calling the statement “ridiculous and false”. In response to a tweet by BJP on Modi's comment, Congress tweeted a couplet, “Jumla hi fekta raha paanch saal ki sarkar mein, socha tha cloudy hai mausam, nahin aaunga radar mein. (He resorted to empty rhetoric during his five-year tenure hoping cloudy weather would keep him off the radar).” Jumla hi fekta raha paanch saal ki sarkar mein, Socha tha cloudy hai mausam, Nahi aaunga radar mein. https://t.co/xDeOg4Yq5K— Congress (@INCIndia) 1557629681000The party attributed the couplet to ‘Mirza Cloudy’, with a photoshopped image of the PM dressed as Mirza Ghalib. In an interview to a TV channel on Saturday, Modi said he used “raw wisdom” to dispel doubts of defence experts who wanted the air strike deferred due to bad weather. “The weather was not good on the day of air strikes. There was a thought that crept in the minds of the experts that the day of strike should be changed. However, I suggested that the clouds could actually help our planes escape the radars,” Modi said while talking about the crossborder strike on terror camps in response to the Pulwama attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said, “Pakistani radar doesn't penetrate clouds. This is an important piece of tactical information that will be critical when planning future air strikes.” PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti added, “I was raked over the coals for questioning veracity of Balakot strikes. But seeing Pakistani media and journalists troll PM on cloud gaffe is awfully embarrassing. BJP's ability to suspend logic in its quest to win another term is mind numbingly fatuous. Our armed forces don't deserve this.” CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury alleged Modi’s TV interview “gave out operational details of a sensitive military mission with a purpose to influence voters during the silent period of the campaign” and wrote to the Election Commission demanding this be recorded and acted upon. Yechury also said Modi had “insulted” the IAF. “National security is not something to be trifled with. Such an irresponsible statement from Modi is highly damaging. Somebody like this can't remain India's PM. Modi's ridiculous comments on radars, clouds and fighter jets have been deservedly mocked but the EC needs to act against him for invoking armed forces hours before the sixth phase of voting. Letter to EC asking for prompt and strict action on this flagrant violation,” Yechury said. Congress MP Rajeev Satav said, “Modiji, I totally understand that you are an expert in planning 'escape' operations including that of Nirav Modi, Mehul Bhai and Vijay Mallya as they were never on your radar.

The BJP chief is campaigning in support of Kangra BJP candidate Kishan Kapoor. “Rahul Gandhi’s aide Omar Abdullah said to have separate prime minister for J&K, but Rahul Baba and his company is silent over this just for the vote bank. By doing this, he is keeping national security on stake. Congress wants to separate Kashmir from India, but till BJP workers are alive in this country, it is not going to happen, even if the party is in power or not” said Shah. He also said that Article 370 that gives special powers to Kashmir will be scrapped if Narendra Modi is elected as prime minister again and questioned Congress for displacement of Kashmiri pundits during their regime. “It is on 12th day of martyrdom of Pulwama martyrs when air strikes took place on terror camps in Pakistan. Everyone in the country was happy. But people mourned in two places - one in Pakistan and other in Congress. Rahul Baba and company grieved in fear of losing their vote bank” he added. Targeting the Congress on the issue of national security, he said the previous Congress government did nothing when Pakistan beheaded five India soldiers but under Modi rule airstrikes were carried out in Balakot. Targeting Pitroda, the BJP chief said, ""If you ask a question regarding the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the Congress says 'hua to hua'.

"Pakistan bans 11 groups for having links with JuD, JeM terror groups - Times of India","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government has banned 11 Lahore-based organisations for having links with proscribed outifts JeM led by global terrorist Masood Azhar, JuD of 2008 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed and the FIF. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) chief Azhar was designated as a global terrorist by the United Nations on May 1. The JeM claimed responsibility for the Pulwama suicide attack that killed 40 CRPF soldiers and led to a spike in military tensions between India and Pakistan. Pakistan in February banned Saeed-led Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and its charity wing Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF) amidst intense global pressure to rein in the militant groups. The decision to ban the 11 organisations was taken during a meeting between Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan and interior minister Ijaz Shah on Friday. After the February 14 Pulwama attack, in which 40 Indian security personnel were killed by a suicide bomber of the Pakistan-based JeM, Khan had said Islamabad would not spare any group involved in terrorism or using Pakistani soil for any kind of terror activity against other countries. Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), which works under the ministry of interior, announced on its website that seven groups have been banned for their affiliation with the JuD, which was proscribed in March by the Pakistan government. The organisation which have been proscribed are Al-Anfal Trust, Idara Khidmat-e-Khalaq, Al-Dawat ul Irshad, Mosques & Welfare Trust, Al-Medina Foundation, Mazz-Bin-Jabel Education Trust and Al-Hamad Trust, the statement said. All these groups are Lahore-based. Pakistan's ministry of interior took the action on the government's directive to speed up implementation of the National Action Plan of 2015 to eliminate terrorism and extremism from the country's soil. Apart from the seven, Lahore-based Al-Fazal Foundation/Trust and Al-Easar Foundation were also banned for having links with the FIF, the NACTA said. The FIF, like JuD, was also banned in March by the Pakistan government. According to the NACTA, Bahawalpur-based Al-Rehmat Trust Organization and Karachi-based Al-Furqan Trust were also banned on Friday for having links with the JeM, which was banned in January 2002. Recently, the government announced to take control of more than 30,000 religious seminaries. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."

Indian Army to induct 460 Russian-origin tanks to add muscle on Pak front | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Army will induct an additional 464 Russian-origin upgraded T-90 'Bhishma' main-battle tanks at a cost of Rs 13,448 crore in the 2022-2026 time frame to bolster its ""shock and awe"" capabilities on the western front, even as Pakistan is also discussing a deal with Russia for acquiring about 360 such tanks. Defence ministry sources on Monday said the ""indent"" to produce the 464 T-90 tanks would soon be placed on the Avadi Heavy Vehicle Factory (HVF) under the Ordnance Factory Board after the cabinet committee on security cleared the licence acquisition from Russia over a month ago. The Army already has around 1,070 T-90 tanks as well as 124 'Arjun' and 2,400 older T-72 tanks in its 67 armoured regiments. After the first 657 T-90 tanks were imported for Rs 8,525 crore from Russia from 2001 onwards, another 1,000 are being progressively licenced and produced by HVF with Russian kits. ""There has been some delay in the indent for the remaining 464 tanks, which will also have night-fighting capabilities. Once it is done, the first 64 tanks should be delivered in 30-41 months,"" said a source. Army to equip T-90 tank with 3-G missile systemThe move comes at a time when the 1.3-million strong Army is also re-formatting its entire war-fighting machinery and the ""Cold Start"" or ""Pro-Active Strategy"", which envisages fast mobilisation to strike hard across the border with multiple offensive thrusts, as was reported earlier by TOI. This task will primarily be carried out by restructured and agile integrated battle groups (IBGs) centred around the T-90S tanks, along with a mix of infantry, artillery, air defence, signals and engineers, backed by attack helicopters. The Army's new Land Warfare Doctrine itself notes that the ""response along the western front will be sharp and swift, with the aim to destroy the adversary's centre of gravity and secure spatial gains"". Army chief General Bipin Rawat in January had announced the new IBGs would be war-gamed in February and then tested in an exercise in May. But the ongoing tensions with Pakistan, in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack and the consequent Balakot air strikes, which led to ""precautionary deployments"", have delayed execution of the plan. ""Pakistan has plans to upgrade its existing mechanised forces, which includes over 50 armoured regiments of Ukrainian T-80UD and Chinese-origin tanks. It wants to acquire new Russian T-90 tanks and indigenously produce others with China's help,"" said a source. India has already procured additional laser-guided Invar missiles and 125mm APFSDS (armourpiercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot) ammunition for its T-90 tanks. But the Army's ""future ready combat vehicle (FRCV)"" project, with an initial quantity of 1,770 FRCVs to be produced under the ""strategic partnership"" policy to replace the older T-72 tanks, however, is yet to take off.

Counsel for the state government told the bench comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Deepak Gupta that the order restricting traffic on the national highway was taken due to the ongoing election and will remain in force till May 31. The bench, after hearing the submissions, said, ""We are not inclined to keep this petition pending.""

"Masood Azhar news: China given additional evidence of Masood Azhar's terror activities, say sources | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: China was given a set of additional evidence about Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar's involvement in terrorist activities,   days after it blocked a fresh proposal at the UN on March 13   to designate him as a global terrorist, diplomatic sources said on Friday. On Wednesday, the Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council   declared him as a global terrorist   after China removed its technical hold on a proposal moved by the UK, France and the US. Following the UN announcement of Azhar's listing, China said it took the decision after carefully studying the ""revised materials"". Sources, however, did not clarify whether the additional evidence given to China was on Azhar's involvement in terror strikes in India including the Pulwama attack, or his activities elsewhere. There was no reference to the Pulwama attack in the UN notification banning Azhar. France, the UK and the US had moved the fresh proposal to declare Azhar as global terrorist by the UN in the wake of the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. The JeM had claimed responsibility for the attack. However, China put a technical hold on the proposal on March 13, blocking it for a fourth time to designate Azhar. Initially, China felt it was not provided with sufficient evidence about Azhar's involvement in terror activities, sources said, adding additional evidence was given to Beijing after it put a technical hold on the proposal to list him as global terrorist. Asked about the impact of India's strike on a JeM training camp in Balakot on February 26, sources said there was no reason to doubt it. The diplomatic sources also said that the European Union is likely to conclude the process soon to designate Azhar as a terrorist although the UN ban on him will cover member countries of the grouping. Germany initiated the move at the European Union, days after China blocked the proposal at the UN to ban him in March. The UN Security Council (UNSC) designation will subject Azhar to an assets freeze, travel ban and an arms embargo. An assets freeze under the sanctions committee requires that all states freeze without delay the funds and other financial assets or economic resources of designated individuals and entities. In 2009, India first moved a proposal by itself to designate Azhar a global terrorist. In 2016 again, India moved the proposal with the P3 -- the US, the UK and France -- in the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee to ban Azhar, also the mastermind of the attack on the Pathankot airbase in January 2016. In 2017, the P3 nations moved a similar proposal again.

Masood Azhar: Pulwama attack played role in listing of Masood Azhar as global terrorist: MEA | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India on Thursday said that the terror attack in Pulwama played a key role in   Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar's listing   as a global terrorist by the United Nations. The assertion came after Pakistan claimed that it agreed to Azhar's listing after all ""political references"", including attempts to link him to the Pulwama attack, were removed from the proposal to designate him a global terrorist. ""The designation is not based on the basis of a specific incident, but on the basis of evidence which we have shared with members of the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee, linking Azhar to several acts of terrorism,"" Ministry of External Affairs spokesperon Raveesh Kumar said at a media briefing. The Congress had welcomed Azhar's designation as a terrorist, party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala had expressed disappointment that the listing ""does not mention Pulwama and Jammu and Kashmir"" while recounting Azhar's role in terror activities. According to sources, since the crucial UNSC press statement issued by all members including China had mentioned the Pulwama attack and noted JeM taking responsibility, the designating states - the US, the UK, France as well as India did not see it necessary to ""re-litigate"" the Pulwama attack in Azhar's listing. It was not just one terror attack that led to the designation of Azhar and that China had been blocking attempts to ban Azhar much before the Pulwama attack, the sources had said. On whether there was any deal with China on the issue during the visit by Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale to Beijing recently, the MEA dismissed any quid pro quo with Beijing. ""We do not negotiate with any country on terrorism and on matters related to the security of the country. China has already given its reason why the hold has been lifted,"" Kumar said. Taking a swipe at Pakistan over its stand on Azhar, Kumar said that Islamabad's only option is to ""pick up some holes"", indicating that it should take strong steps to combat terrorism. ""Elements are being introduced to divert attention from Pakistan on this diplomatic setback that they have suffered. They cannot welcome the decision, they cannot criticize the decision. The only option left for them is to pick up some holes,"" he said. Hours after the UN designated Azhar as a global terrorist, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday claimed that the JeM chief was listed under Pakistan's Anti-Terrorism Act ""much before"" the case of his listing was taken up before the world body. ""You are aware that the listing of Masood Azhar had been under consideration in the Sanctions Committee for several years, (since 2009). He has been proscribed under Pakistan's Anti-Terrorism Act for some time, even before his case for listing was taken up by the Sanctions Committee,"" read a statement issued by Pakistan's Foreign Ministry. The statement further argued that the earlier proposals to list the JeM chief ""failed to generate the requisite consensus in the sanction committee"" as the information regarding the terrorist activities of Azhar and his outfits did not meet the technical rules and regulations. Meanwhile, Azhar has been shifted to a safe house in Islamabad from his residence in Bahawalpur by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), sources have said. The proposal to designate Azhar under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council was moved by France, UK and the US on February 27. The proposal was the fourth attempt at the UN in the last 10 years to list Azhar as a global terrorist which finally came through after China lifted its hold on the proposal by the US, UK and France to blacklist him. A UNSC designation will subject Azhar to an assets freeze, travel ban and an arms embargo. An assets freeze under the Sanctions Committee requires that all states freeze without delay the funds and other financial assets or economic resources of designated individuals and entities. A dossier prepared by the government on the global terrorist which has also been shared with the international community, says that the Azhar was ""put under house arrest at Markaz Subhan Allah in Bahawalpur, post 'Balakot Attack' (26.02.2019) and has been recently shifted to a Safe House in Islamabad.""

Pakistan says it will ‘immediately’ implement sanctions against Masood Azhar - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday reacted to UN designating Masood Azhar as a global terrorist saying it will “immediately” implement the sanctions imposed on the Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) chief. At the same time, Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Muhammad Faisal emphasized at a press conference here that the current amended proposal at the UN Sanctions Committee was approved “once politically motivated attempts to link it with the Pulwama incident and the legitimate Kashmiri struggle for the realization of the right to self-determination were removed”. “The UNSC decision entails travel restrictions, asset freeze and arms embargo,” said Faisal, adding that “Pakistan is a responsible state and we will take responsible action”. Faisal said the UN Sanctions machinery is governed by rules, procedures and defined processes. “The proposals for listing are examined, reviewed and acted upon, in line with specific, technical criteria. Technical holds, confidentiality provisions and consensus decision making are part of the listing process,” he added. The FO said Azhar’s listing has been under consideration of the UN’s Sanctions Committee for almost a decade. “Previous proposals to list Masood Azhar did not meet the technical criteria as they included factors unrelated to the listing rules and were thus rejected,” Faisal said. The previous proposal, he said, was presented on the basis of considerations beyond the listing parameters. As a result, a technical hold was placed by China to bring it in line with the listing criteria, he added. Since 2008, Pakistan had been blocking the move through China to enlist Azhar as a global terrorist. Termed as a ‘technical hold’, the last such move took place on March 13 this year, less than a month after JeM had accepted responsibility for the Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. “Pakistan has always called for all countries to strictly comply with the listing rules and procedures and maintain the integrity of the UN sanctions regime. Pakistan has also underlined that leveraging UN Sanctions regime to advance political objectives is counterproductive,” the FO said. Faisal denied that the development was a “victory for India” and emphasised that the UNSC decision was in line with vision of Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan to not allow any terror group to operate in the country. “Since January 2019, Pakistan has accelerated the implementation of the National Action Plan against terrorism and extremism. The Plan inter alia includes a range of actions against UN proscribed entities and individuals,” said the FO spokesperson. “Notwithstanding the challenges, progress is being made and further work will continue in line with national consensus and interest,” he added.

Mamata supporting those who wish to divide India: Amit Shah - Times of India,"KALYANI: Stepping up its attack on Mamata Banerjee, BJP president Amit Shah on Wednesday said the West Bengal chief minister has extended her support to those who wish to separate Kashmir from India. Addressing a rally at Kalyani in Bongaon Lok Sabha constituency, Shah said the BJP will continue its fight to ensure that Kashmir remains an integral part of India, no matter who is in power at the Centre. ""Today we are in power, Narendra Modi is the prime minister. In the coming days, too, he will continue as the PM. But if a day comes when the BJP is no longer in power, its workers will still fight to ensure that Kashmir remains an integral part of India,"" he said. Shah also insisted that Banerjee should also clear her stance on former Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah's demand for a separate prime for his state. ""Mamata didi is supporting those who wish to divide India. We want to know what is her stand on Omar Abdullah's demand for two prime ministers in the country,"" he said. Referring to infiltrators as ""termites"", who are eating into the country's resources, Shah said his party will throw them out after coming to power at the Centre for a second term. He iterated that lawlessness has increased in the state, with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) dispensation making Bengal a ""safe haven"" for the infiltrators. ""Other than bomb manufacturing units, no factory has been set up in the state under the Mamata Banerjee government,"" he stated. Talking about the Balakot air strikes, which was carried out in retaliation to Pulwama attack in Kashmir, Shah said the entire country celebrated the strikes, apart from Pakistan and two other individuals - Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee. ""Only Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee mourned the air strikes. They are more interested in securing their vote banks than strengthening our national security,"" he said.

Family of soldier killed in Pulwama attack votes for Modi - Times of India,"PHARSAMA: The mud-house of Vijay Soreng, one among the 44 CRPF jawans who was killed in the Pulwama terror bombing on February 14, is at the end of a newly-constructed road. In Soreng’s village Pharsama, 100kms south west of Ranchi, the road to his house was completed last year, just a few months before the Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bombing, that killed him 2000 kms away in Pulwama, became the biggest political issue for the Modi government in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. His mother, Lakshmi (60), who is yet to recover from the grief of losing her 47-year-old son, however disagrees that the BJP government politicized the killings of the CRPF jawans in Pulwama. “I don’t think there is any politics in it,” she says emphatically arguing that people in the country are talking about his son and other jawans on their own. Wife of a retired soldier, Vrish (65), Lakshmi also endorses the Modi government’s air strikes against Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camps in Balakot. “That was the right thing to do,” she says. Sitting next to Lakshmi, her younger son, Sanjay (40) argues that though their loss will never be reversed but the retaliation by the government and the forces brought the family a certain “satisfaction that our enemies got at least some response.” In a dark room where the photo-frame of his son is garlanded and placed on a table, Lakshmi says, the Modi government should come back to power. “We should certainly give them another five years,” Sanjay adds to his mother’s view. He believes that the Modi government has been working a great deal for India’s national security. “I am saying this not for any personal interest but in the interest of the nation,” he adds quickly. The entire village, he says, feels safer and better off with the current dispensation. “For almost 70 years, there was nothing here,” the Soreng family and the villagers in the nearby vicinity mention. In the last five years, the basics of life like concrete houses, toilets, electricity and water have been introduced under various Central government schemes. “A lot still needs to be done,” Sanjay and several people in the neighborhood say hoping that the Modi government will fulfil the promise that it would make Vijay’s native place a model village. Vijay’s 21-year-old son Arun, a college student who lives with her mother Kamala Ba, a policewoman with the 10th battalion of Jharkhand Armed Police in Ranchi, arrived in the village last night to cast his vote for the BJP on Monday. Pharsama in Basia block of Gumla district is part of the Lohardaga parliamentary constituency. “The entire family went to the polling booth in the village this morning to fulfil our duty as Indian citizens even as we still grieve,” says Arun.

"PM taking credit for valour of forces, not accepting responsibility for Pulwama attack: Congress - Times of India","JAIPUR: The Congress Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi took credit for the valour of the armed forces, but his government was not ready to accept responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack. Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also alleged that when the entire country was in shock over the terror attack, the prime minister was busy shooting a film in Jim Corbett national park. ""The prime minister is taking credit for the valour of defence forces for votes... Why doesn't he accept responsibility and failure of his government, national security advisor, home ministry and intelligence even three months after the terrorist attack?"" he said a press conference here. Surjewala also sought to know why was Jaish-e-Mohammed threat video released 48 hours before the terrorist attack overlooked and from where did terrorists get such a huge quantity of explosive materials, carbines and rocket launchers. ""Why was J&K Police input released on February 8 on terrorist attack overlooked and the request for air-transit facility for CRPF jawans turned down?"" he asked.

 Could have inflicted heavy damage on Pak during Feb 27 dogfight if possessed 'tech asymmetry': IAF | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: If the Indian Air Force (IAF) possessed high levels of ""technological asymmetry"", then it would have been able to inflict heavy damage on Pakistan during the adversary's unsuccessful aerial raid on February 27, according to an IAF report. The report analysed various aspects of IAF's air strike on a Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26 and the subsequent Pakistani retaliation the next day. India carried out the air strike to avenge the Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. In the report, the IAF said Pakistan Air Force has been consistently enhancing its air defence and offensive capabilities since the Kargil war in 1999 and there was a need for India to bolster its ""technological asymmetry"" for aerial combat, official sources said sharing details from the report. At present, Pakistan has some edge with its fleet of F-16 jets with AMRAAM missile fitted with them, said an official. The sources said the planned induction of Rafale aircraft with deadly Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) and S-400 air defence missile system will provide India a significant advantage over Pakistani Air Force. ""We felt we could not punish the adversaries appropriately. So we need to bolster technological asymmetry so that the enemy does not even dare to come close to the border,"" said a source. On the Balakot strikes, the report said the Israeli Spice 2000 precision guided munitions (PGM) fired from Mirage 2000 jets hit five out of the six designated targets in the JeM training facility. However, one Spice PGM did not leave the aircraft because of a drift in the inertial navigation system. The report said the deception used was successful as Pakistan was caught off guard despite their air force being put on highest alert. Various packages of jets flew in several directions including a fleet of Jaguars went towards Bahawalpur, a key air base of Pakistan Air Force, sources said. In the list of possitives from the strike, the IAF talked about accuracy of intelligence inputs, precise selection of targets, demonstration of its ability to carry out precision strikes and its success in maintaining secrecy of the operation though over 6,000 personnel were involved in it. In its analysis of possible areas for improvement, the IAF sought superior technological asymmetry and air defence system over Pakistan, sources said. It also talked about the need for procuring new weapons and other platforms for enhancing the IAF's overall combat capabilities. Sources said the IAF has began working on all the negative aspects mentioned in the report. Induction of Rafale jets along with Meteor beyond-visual-range missile and S-400 air defence missile system will provide India an edge over Pakistan, according to the report. India is procuring a batch of S-400 air defence system from Russia at a cost of USD 5 billion. India is also buying 36 Rafale fighter jets from France at a cost of Rs 58,000 crore. During the aerial combat of February 27, IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman had engaged with one of the Pakistani F-16s and shot it down before his Mig-21 Bison was downed. Varthaman was captured by Pakistan and was released after spending nearly 60 hours in Pakistani custody. The Indian Air Force had on February 28 displayed pieces of an AMRAAM missile, fired by a Pakistani F-16, as evidence to prove that Pakistan deployed the US-manufactured fighter jets during the raid. Pakistan has been claiming that it had not lost any F-16 during the February 27 dogfight. Rejecting Pakistan's claims, the IAF on April 8 released radar images as part of its ""irrefutable evidence"" to assert that it shot down an F-16 fighter jet of Pakistan during the aerial combat over Nowshera in Jammu and Kashmir.

"From Balakot post Pulwama attack to TV entertainment, rallies picked up in last days | Nagpur News - Times of India","BULDHANA: Till last week, the campaigning for Lok Sabha polls was lacklustre in this westernmost district of Vidarbha. But, from Monday, it started picking up with all parties conducting their rallies and also inviting their star performers. Before campaigning deadline ended on Tuesday at 5pm, many rallies and addresses by stalwarts took place in all seven assembly constituencies of the district. On Monday afternoon, NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s rally received a huge response where he flayed Modi for politicizing the Balakot attacks and the soldiers killed in Pulwama blasts. He called on people to vote for party’s candidate Rajendra Shingane who had fought polls with MP Prataprao Jadhav in 2009 but lost by a narrow margin of 28,000 votes. He was followed by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis who addressed a massive rally in Chikhli, about an hour away from Buldhana. He not only targeted Pawar but also Congress chief Rahul Gandhi by comparing his declarations with an entertainment channel, which carries disclaimers. While explaining development works carried out by his government and those at centre for Buldhana, the CM appealed to people to vote for Jadhav who is eyeing a hat-trick of wins from this constituency. After them, it was the turn of second-rung leadership to take out rallies on Tuesday. NCP state president Jayant Patil addressed the public at Khamgaon in afternoon and criticized Modi government for going back on its promises. Later, former MLA Dilipkumar Sananda took out a rally at same places. Earlier in morning, Jadhav took out a massive rally where hundreds joined him in Buldhana’s Sangam Chowk. It was a saffron surge at all major squares in Buldhana. People were seen responding to Jadhav’s calls. Due to presence of political bigwigs, Buldhana, which is a sleepy town, suddenly turned into a happening place with rallies, banners, posters and even traditional band continuing from morning to evening, since last week. All home, offices, kiosk or elsewhere, the only topic of discussions is elections. Prakash Ambnedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) is also not behind in campaigning where he himself had addressed a couple of rallies in support of their candidate MLA Baliram Shiraskar. Poll analysts have already predicted a tough fight between Jadhav and Shingane. Both belong to the dominant Maratha community and their victory would depend on how much they secure from their own people. Cooperative sector is another dominant factor in the Buldhana politics and both are major players of it. While Shingane served as chairman of Buldhana Cooperative Bank, Jadhav was his deputy. Analysts term Jadhav as favourite to win his third term as Shingane was not in fray after losing in 2009 polls. They said VBA and BSP would also eat into Congress votes which would be a big disadvantage for Shingane. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Masood Azhar: China gets ultimatum to lift 'technical' hold on Azhar | World News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The campaign for an international ban on Masood Azhar, the Pakistan based leader of UN-designated terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), is gaining steam at the UN Security Council. The proposers of the resolution to ban Azhar - US, UK and France - have asked China to lift its   ""technical"" hold on the ban proposed in the UNSC   1267 sanctions committee in the next couple of weeks or face another resolution for the same in the Council. Even as negotiations continue, a western diplomatic source said Beijing had been provided time tentatively until April 23 to lift the hold before a proposal for proscribing Azhar is officially and directly introduced in the Council, bypassing the 1267 committee. Germany backs move to ban Masood AzharThis parallel resolution in the Council had been circulated informally among the 15 member states but not tabled officially, allowing for informal discussions to see if China could be persuaded to review its position on Azhar. So far though, there has been no indication of Beijing considering lifting its hold on the ban which is necessary for imposing travel restrictions on Azhar and freezing his assets. Efforts for a ban on Azhar were renewed by the US and France after the February 14 Pulwama attack carried out by JeM. China though for the 4th time sought to block his listing by the 1267 committee by putting the proposed ban on what it describes as a technical hold. Frustrated by Beijing's hold, the US informally circulated another draft resolution for consideration of the members in the Council. Beijing described the US move as not constructive and as setting a bad example. This was the first time a draft resolution had been moved directly in the Council for a ban on a terrorist of interest to India. Depending on how China responds, a decision will be taken in the 4th week of April on whether or not the draft resolution should be put formally on the table, TOI has learnt. After the resolution is tabled, another round of consultations is likely on the specifics of the document. The resolution can then be put to vote. The US and others including India will hope that China will abstain allowing the ban to go through. During the consultations, the Council members can also call for a public debate on the issue, forcing China to explain before the world why it continued to support a dreaded terrorist like Azhar. China has indicated to India that it is willing to have constructive discussions on the issue of Azhar. ""On the issue of listing in the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council, China attaches importance to and understands India’s concerns and is willing to strengthen communication with India to find a proper solution,"" said Chinese ambassador Luo Zhaohui in a newspaper article recently. However, the issue of Azhar's ban can't also be prolonged indefinitely at the UNSC. China's hold can last for 9 months and it's perhaps in everybody's interest that the issue is resolved, either way, much earlier.

"Amit Shah polarising, complains Congress - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Congress clashed with BJP over Amit Shah’s remark during a poll rally that if voted back to office, the ruling party would ensure the expulsion of all infiltrators except Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs, saying it was an attempt to polarise elections and divide people. Congress referred to a tweet on BJP’s handles that said, “We will ensure implementation of NRC in the entire country. We will remove every single infiltrator from the country, except Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs.” Shah’s remarks at a poll rally in West Bengal kicked up a furore on social media too. The video of the BJP chief’s speech, posted on the party’s Twitter handle, said, “When we say we will bring NRC, Mamata di scares Bengali refugees that you will have to go... I want to say, the citizenship amendment bill means that those who came from Bangladesh and Pakistan, Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh refugees, they will not be sent back.” Referring to the IAF strike in Pakistan after the Pulwama terrorist attack, he said, “Let Mamata do ILU (I love you) with them (Pakistan). We are not going to compromise on the country’s security.” Shah’s statement, which referred to the terms of the citizenship amendment bill that identifies minorities facing persecution in neighbouring countries, was latched on to by the political opposition as yet another attempt by BJP to polarise the elections. “This is the ‘New India’ they want, one completely devoid of unity and brotherhood,” Congress said. The opposition party also accused BJP of spreading hate, a charge the party has reiterated and for which it has lodged formal complaints with the Election Commission.

Inside Balakot madrassa struck by India: Pakistan not ready to give up secrets - Times of India,"JABA: A madrasaa, or Islamic school, on a remote hilltop in northeastern Pakistan that was the target of the Indian air strike just over six weeks ago is still not ready to give up its secrets. For the first time since the Indian Air Force jets targeted a Jaish-e-Muhammed terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistani authorities on Wednesday allowed a group of journalists working for foreign news organisations, and foreign diplomats based in Islamabad, access to the site. According to BBC Urdu, the group was flown from Islamabad in a helicopter to Jabba in Balakot. The visitors trekked for about one-and-a-half hour to reach the madrassa on the top of a mountain surrounded by lush green trees. The expectation among some of the visitors was that it might help settle a number of mysteries about the attack. But the journalists and diplomats, most of whom spent well over an hour climbing steep slopes to get to the madrasa in the Jaba village area near the town of Balakot, didn’t get enough time to make any kind of informed assessment. They were mostly restricted to looking around the madrassa’s main building. They were hurried away by the Pakistani army, which organised the trip, after less than half an hour. Those arriving by vehicle had even less time. The interactions with teachers and about 100 children at the madrassa - from the very young to older teenagers - were also limited. The visitors were shown a group of children learning passages from the Quran partly by rocking their heads back and forward in rhythm. One teacher said he had worked at the madrassa for six years. The visitors were shown students reciting verses from the Quran at the madrasa situated near the impact site. (Reuters Photo)Too little, too lateAt least three of the diplomats, who were mainly from Western countries and the Middle East and included some military attaches, said it was very difficult to draw any firm conclusions because of the six-week delay in gaining access and the restricted time allowed to look around. On the trek up to the compound, past small sheep and goat farms and through pastoral scenery on a beautiful spring day, journalists and diplomats were shown craters that the allegedly wayward missiles had created on the surrounding hillsides. Tensions had flared up between India and Pakistan after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based JeM killed 40 CRPF personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out a counterterror operation, hitting the biggest JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26.

PM Modi no hero in Pulwama martyr’s village | Chennai News - Times of India,"TUTICORIN: As the sun sets over Savalaperi hamlet, V Ganapathy quietly prays at his son’s grave. Set against the backdrop of bald mountains and a vast stretch of barren land, the fenced-in grave and the sight of the old man in front of the framed picture of CRPF jawan G Subramanian, evokes a sense of poignancy. It’s nearly two months since the body of Subramanian, one of the 40 CRPF jawans killed in the Pulwama attack, was brought home to Savalaperi in Tuticorin district. Family members are still in a state of anguish. Subramanian’s mother Marudathaal is yet to come to terms with her son’s death. The old couple asked their elder son to give up his electrician’s job in Abu Dhabi and return home. Wife Krishnaveni is now junior assistant in the state revenue department, a job she got after Subramanian’s death. The deep sorrow notwithstanding, the family and the village are gearing up for the Lok Sabha election. They have never failed to exercise their franchise, voting for the AIADMK in most elections. Brightly painted symbols of various parties adorn the walls of small terraced houses and the local tea shop. The AMMK has put up a poster of Subramanian “saluting the soldier”. But, Ganapathy is yet to get any political support for constructing a memorial for his son. Bricks have been piled up and so too heaps of granite pebbles and sand on a one-cent piece of land across the road, falling within Akilandapuram panchayat. His village is in Savalaperi panchayat. Various party candidates came in with their noisy caravan, promising to get it done. However, not a brick or pebble has moved, not even the mandatory clearance from the panchayat. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi criss-crossed the country, invoking the Pulwama martyrs to strike a chord with the youth, unmindful of the Election Commission’s warnings, Ganapathy and his family quietly fumed against his policies and government. There’s simmering anger against Modi. “We blame him, his government for the killing of the CRPF jawans and rising costs,” says Subramanian’s mother Marudathaal. But, there’s also the resolve that “for the sake of minister Kadambur Raju” they would choose the ‘lotus’ – under compulsion of loyalty. The Information and publicity minister’s native village Kadambur is 15km from Savalaperi. Savalaperi also happens to be the hometown of another CRPF jawan M Periyadurai, who was among the personnel who brought down Subramanian’s body. Periyadurai’s father R Marithurai is busy with preparations for his son’s marriage after the election, at a Murugan temple in Tiruchendur. “There is lots of anger against Modi,” he says, adding, “We hold him responsible for the rising costs of every essential item, GST and demonetization.” As Ganapathy lights a lamp before a big framed picture of his son in the foyer of his house, the family goes silent. “He was interested in farming. I wish he had pursued that. He would have still been alive,” says Krishnveni, watching her father-in-law place a small garland of flowers on the picture frame.

" Lies being spread about J&amp;K national highway curbs, says govt | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Wednesday sought to counter the “deliberate and mischievous disinformation” campaign that the Jammu-Srinagar national highway in J&K had been closed to civilians and said the restrictions were only applicable for 12 hours, two days a week. Also, during the restriction period, alternative routes like the old national highway and internal roads were available for civilians’ commute without any hassles, said an officer. “An impression is being created by some individuals that the national highway has been closed for civilians. This is farthest from the truth,” the officer said, adding that the total duration of prohibition of civilian traffic on Jammu-Srinagar national highway since April 3 was for 24 hours, which was 15% of 168 hours in a week. “It may be recalled that restrictions were in place in J&K earlier also and are imposed from time to time in other parts of the country for movement of the convoys of security forces,” the officer said. While regulations for restricting civilian traffic during convoy movements were already in place, the J&K government has drawn up a plan for movement of security forces on the national highway for a 15-day duration, up to May 31, keeping in view the convoy efficiency and security of the personnel, particularly in the backdrop of the Pulwama attack on February 14 and a similar unsuccessful attempt on March 31. The restrictions have been re-imposed, after taking into account the requirements of students, patients etc and also ensuring minimum public hindrance, the officer said. A robust mechanism to assist the public in emergencies has also been ensured, he added. A mechanism has also been put in place to review these restrictions from time to time. The officer complained that certain vested interests were raking up this issue with utter disregard to the lives of security personnel and without any consideration for national security. The restrictions are being implemented by the state government without any inconvenience to people, the officer said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Lok Sabha elections: Parties go shrill with war talk - Times of India,"BENGALURU: Pakistan figures prominently in election rhetoric in Karnataka and the three major political parties have indiscriminately spoken of war with the neighbouring country. The discourse hit a low when chief minister HD Kumaraswamy suggested he was not surprised by the terrorist attack in Pulwama since he has been tipped off by a former Army officer that an attack like it would happen just before elections. Kumaraswamy was alluding to BJP machinations to foment nationalist sentiment during elections, but state BJP leaders pounced on the Kumaraswamy’s comments and turned the issue into one of national security. “If he had advance information on the attack, Kumaraswamy’s responsibility was to alert authorities,” said senior BJP leader Jagadish Shettar. “By keeping quiet, he is now a culprit and should be booked.” Kumaraswamy alleged BJP leaders were twisting his statement “to mislead people”. “In fact, what I knew was that Modi was up to some gimmick related to war against Pakistan just before the election,” he told TOI. But the rhetoric over war has been shrill. Congress leaders reminded voters about the 1971 war where India, under Indira Gandhi, crushed Pakistan. They pointed out that Indian armed forces took about 90,000 Pakistanis prisoners apart from getting the Pakistani army to sign a surrender pact. “Modi has nothing to say about his government’s achievements, so he is talking about war against Pakistan and surgical strikes,” said Siddaramaiah, Congress legislature party leader and former chief minister. “But the fact is India defeated Pakistan hands down under Congress rule.” JD(S) state president H Vishwanath even sought to remind people that it was BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee who called Indira Gandhi Maa Durga after the 1971 war. “BJP leaders think public memory is short, but the more they talk about Pulwama, the more they will help people remember the victorious wars against Pakistan,” Vishwanath said. But BJP leaders say they will continue to talk about the surgical strikes. “What the nation needs is strong leadership,” said senior BJP leader CT Ravi. “The Balakot air strike shows Modi is a fearless leader.” Analysts say the euphoria created in four (1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999) war victories against Pakistan helped people bond and this has become an easy tool for politicians to consolidate votes. “Issues of national security and war euphoria are being used like never before. This is because rival parties kept it alive by their aggressive reaction to the BJP’s rhetoric,” said a political tracker MB Adinarayana.

Delhi: Jaish-e-Mohammed on the run since 2015 held | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist on the run since his conviction by Delhi high court in 2015 was finally arrested by Delhi Police’s Special Cell. Police had been tracking Fayaz Ahmad Lone since then, but the trail had gone cold once he reached Srinagar and rejoined the JeM cadre. The cops were alerted to some Jaish cadres planning an attack on Delhi and swung into action. DCP (Special Cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said the investigators found that the three JeM men had been in touch with Pakistan and Kashmir-based JeM commanders and receiving orders for the next hit. The 40-year-old resident of Kupwara was arrested by a team led by ACP Sanjay Dutt and inspector Rahul on Monday. Sources said that the police teams are now hunting for two of Lone’s associates, Bashir Ahmad Maulvi and Abdul Majeed Baba, both of whom are residents of Sopore in Kashmir. DCP Yadav added that Lone and three others, among them their Pakistan-based commander, had earlier been arrested with arms, ammunition and explosives in 2007. But when they went off the grid four years ago after their conviction, Delhi high court issued non-bailable warrants against Lone and his two associates. Lone was believed to have become part of a sleeper cell providing the active JeM cadres with logistical support. Lone was in the Jaish squad that reached Delhi on February 4, 2007 on the Malwa Express with the intent to carry out an attack in the capital. The disembarked at the New Delhi Railway Station at 9pm and walked to the Ranjeet Singh flyover near DDU Marg to meet a fourth man. The cops swooped in and overpowered the quartet after a gunfight. The police had recovered 3kg of explosives, four non-electric detonators, a timer, six hand grenades, a .30 bore Chinese Star pistol and ammunition and cash. Among the arrested was Shahid Gafoor of Sialkot, Pakistan, who disclosed that he had reached Delhi via Dhaka and Kolkata. Gafoor had also crossed over to India twice earlier, in 1998 and in 2002. He and others had carried out attacks on Rashtriya Rifles camps. Lone is the son of a farmer in Kupwara’s Marhama village, who started an electronics business with a bank loan in 200 but had to close his shop due to rising losses. He then shifted to Allahabad to sell shawls. In 2005, he came in contact with a LIC agent named Altaf Ahmed Kirmani, a Sopore native, who persuaded him to join the Islamic jihad and promised him money to repay his bank loan. Lone had admitted that he was in contact with a commander named Haider alias Doctor, who trained him for the attacks in Delhi. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

 Senior officer to lead CRPF convoys in Kashmir; maximum 40 vehicles at one time | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: CRPF convoys moving to and from the Kashmir Valley will now be commandeered by a higher officer and a single motorcade will not have more than 40 vehicles at any point of time, the paramilitary force has ordered in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 troops during a similar movement. PTI has accessed a set of new standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the force headquarters in Delhi for vehicle-mounted movement of troops in Jammu and Kashmir, and it has also been ordered that the 'passenger manifest discipline' for each vehicle in the convoy be strictly adhered to. Among the first set of changed SOPs is the move to depute a second-in-command rank officer (equivalent to Superintendent of Police rank) of the force to lead the convoy instead of the current practice of a junior Assistant Commandant-rank (Assistant SP) officer heading the entourage. This is to ensure that the convoy is led by an experienced and senior officer who will have a better understanding and strategy to manoeuvre the convoy to and from the Kashmir Valley which is operationally very sensitive due to terrorist acts and IED threats, official sources said. This will also upgrade the accountability hierarchy and the new convoy commander will now directly report and co-ordinate with one of the three Central Reserve Police Force Deputy Inspector General (operations) based in Kashmir. Till now, the convoy commander or the Assistant Commandant used to report through the Commandant to their higher-ups. The convoy commander usually travels in the lead in a communications gadget-fitted vehicle comprising armed troops for quick reaction. It has also been decided that the convoy strength will not go beyond 40 vehicles in any case and ""all possible efforts"" will be made to essentially keep the number of vehicles in a motorcade to the least possible of about 10-20 for effective management and control, they said. A CRPF bus in the fifth position of a 78 vehicle convoy was targeted by a Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) suicide bomber after he detonated his explosives-laden SUV near it on the Jammu-Srinagar highway in Pulwama on February 14. The over 2,500 personnel strength convoy was being commanded by an AC-rank officer and all 39 personnel in the ill-fated bus and a sub-officer stationed on the ground, as part of a road sanitisation party, were killed in the deadly blast. The force undertook a huge and time-taking task of identifying the bodies of its martyred personnel as the blast had blown the bus and its occupants to smithereens making it difficult to identify the mortal remains as it is understood that some men changed their vehicles when the convoy last halted. It has, sources said, hence been decided that all those who are allotted a seat in the vehicle will scrupulously stick to the seating plan and re-board the same bus or truck after the convoy resumes post a refreshment break. A sub-officer in the rank of an Inspector or a Sub-Inspector will be responsible for ensuring that the passenger manifest of each vehicle remains intact, they said. The convoys will also have a changed strategy of having bullet-proof mobile bunkers which are always deployed at frequent gaps in the motorcade for any armed offensive or defensive action in case of an attack. Also, each vehicle in the convoy will have armed security personnel as usual, but their numbers and position will be changed dynamically and as per operational requirements, they said. The CRPF, designated lead force for internal security duties and anti-terrorist operations in Kashmir, is also mulling to create a new full-fledged transit facility for its troops in Udhampur that will reduce by about 70 km, the distance between Jammu and Srinagar. The present transit camp is in Jammu and it takes about 10-12 hours for convoys to cover about 300 km between these locations. A transit facility in Udhampur will reduce the time taken and the risk involved in running convoys, which cannot be done away with completely despite the government recently allowing all personnel to take a flight to Srinagar from either Jammu or Delhi, they said. The around three lakh personnel strength force has about 65 battalions or about 70,000 personnel deployed in the Kashmir Valley and has two sectors, Kashmir and Kashmir operations, headed by two Inspector General rank officers. CRPF Director General R R Bhatnagar had last week told the news agency that they are going to procure a new fleet of mine protected vehicles, small 30-seater buses and provide more partial armour to its troop carrying buses to ensure safety of jawans post the Pulwama attack, the worst in the valley on security forces in over three decades.

 Red herring? Pakistan wants details of Pulwama bomber's guns | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In what is being read by India as lack of any serious intent in probing the Pakistan link to the Pulwama attack, Islamabad has set out a list of, as sources here put it, trivial demands that include seeking the gun type, manufacturer and ""identification numbers"" of the weapon brandished by suicide bomber Adil Dar in his confession video. Pakistan has also sought a copy of the FIR registered by India in the   February 14 Pulwama bombing   which killed 40 CRPF troopers and asked for statements of witnesses in its reply to   India's February 27 dossier.  Indian authorities see these demands, especially the one for details of Dar's guns, as delaying tactics, if not a red herring. The weapons in question were not used for the attack and their identification, or lack of it, is unlikely to have any bearing on the Pulwama investigations. Dar was seen armed with several weapons in the pre-suicide video in which he admitted   he was a member of Jaish-e-Muhammed   and that he had been tasked with carrying out the attack. The attack was swiftly owned and evidence given to Pakistan included coordinates of a WhatsApp number used by a JeM member to claim responsibility. The government sees Pakistan's response to several important issues raised in India's dossier as disappointing. ""There were specific and actionable inputs about JeM's involvement but it doesn't seem Pakistan has acted on those in a serious and focused manner,"" said a source on condition of anonymity. Apart from inputs on JeM complicity in the attack, India had also provided information about its terror camps and its leaders. In its response, which TOI has accessed, Pakistan has accused India of not sharing initial investigation details like the FIR and witness statements. While accusing Pakistan of following the 26/11 and Pathankot attack script even in Pulwama investigations, India said last week it was examining the ""paper"" handed over by Pakistan. Pakistan has sought details about how and where the vehicle-borne improvised explosive device used for the attack was prepared and also the source and quantity of the explosives. However, while India called for action in the dossier against 90 individuals closely linked with JeM, Islamabad has demanded information on how each of these individuals was linked to the Pulwama attack. India reads this as another sign of Pakistan's reluctance to take serious and credible action against JeM terrorists on its soil. That JeM owning up responsibility for the attack is seen as very significant and the government had asked Pakistan to help identify one Mohammed Hassan who was said to have made the claim of Jaish's role in WhatsApp messages. Pakistan though has asked for more information about his identity even though it is unlikely that India would have withheld such information which needs to be pursued in Pakistani territory. Pakistan has demanded call detail records of Hassan's number besides information about the identity of the subscriber of the number contacted by the person. India had also mentioned WhatsApp and Telegram groups in which views had been shared by suspects on the terror attack. Pakistan in its response has sought GSM numbers used by the administrators of the group. Pakistan also wants to know the IP address which was used to upload Dar's video and details of those held by India for the attack. Pakistan also sought copies of reports submitted in compliance with section 173 of CrPc. India had said last week in an official response that Pakistan regrettably continues to be in denial and even refused to acknowledge Pulwama as a terror attack. ""It has not shared details of credible action, if any, taken by it against terrorists or terrorist organisations based in territories under its control,"" it had said.

" Pulwama attack a gift to BJP, says former RAW chief | India News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: The Pulwama terror attack was a gift to the BJP ahead of the elections and it was 'alright' to carry out surgical strikes on terror camp in Pakistan, former chief of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) A S Dulat said Saturday. ""I think it is, I mentioned this before, I think it was gift from the Jaish to the BJP or to Modiji. Because of elections. It was inevitable that something would happen. Something would be done. So, the surgical strike deep inside Pakistan was alright,"" he told reporters here. He was asked how he assessed the present government's handling of the Pulwama terror attack and about the way ahead. Dulat said nationalism is alright if it is looked at broadly but it may not be good if it is seen narrowly. ""The larger point I am making is that what is sufficient is patriotism. We need not stress on nationalism. Because, the indications worldwide are, in the past also, that nationalism can lead to war,"" he said. Dulat, who was speaking on the sidelines of the annual Asian Arab Awards 2019 organised here by the Indian Economic Trade Organisation, was asked about his comments that nationalism is unbalancing the world. Dulat quoted a former president of France as saying that ""we should shed our prejudices. Otherwise, it leads to nationalism and nationalism means war."" Another foreign leader had said, ""nationalism is wrecking my patriotism."" ""The point I am trying to make is that if you look at nationalism broadly, it is alright. If you start looking at it narrowly, then it starts affecting people,"" he said. In his speech earlier, Dulat stressed the need for promoting peace. He praised New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for her ""they are us"" comments in the aftermath of attacks at mosques in that country. Referring to the ""they are us"" comment, he said the words should set an example for the world, that ultimately everybody is one and the ""whole business of nationalism is going to take this world nowhere"". He favoured talks with Kashmiris and also with Pakistan as the way forward. ""We need to talk. We need to talk to the Kashmiris. We need to talk ultimately to Pakistan also. There is no other way,"" Dulat said. He was asked what should be the way forward for Indian government to deal with such kind of issues (terror and others). Asked why no solution has been reached (Kashmir issue) even after 60 years and the way ahead, he recalled former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as having said the government then was a ""signature away"" from reaching an agreement. ""If you recall, Manmohan Singh while demitting office said that they were only a signature away from reaching an agreement. Dr Manmohan Singh and Musharraf or India and Pakistan, if that agreement had been reached and that agreement actually was an agreement on the Line of Control, then I think we would have had about 15 years of peace in Kashmir,"" Dulat said.

"Masood Azhar: US, China in bitter showdown at UN over sanctions on Masood Azhar | World News - Times of India","The US and China seem headed for a showdown at the UN over Jaish chief Masood Azhar with Beijing accusing Washington of ""forcefully moving"" a resolution in the Security Council intended to compel China to make public its reasons for stalling efforts to tag him as a ""global terrorist"". With Beijing persisting with a ""technical hold"", preventing the sanctions committee of the UNSC from designating the Jaish-e-Muhammed chief as a terrorist, Washington has sought to raise the heat by seeking a discussion in the council - inviting a sharp Chinese retort that it should act with caution. Acting with the support of France and the UK, the US bumped up the issue of listing Azhar on Wednesday. China draws ire of other UNSC members for saving Jaish chief Masood AzharThe move came two weeks after China, for the fourth time, put a hold on a proposal to list him under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the council. Never before has a terrorist of interest to India been targeted at the council in this manner. The other 14 members of the council are said to be supporting the proposed ban. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in Beijing that the   US was undermining the authority of the sanctions committee   . ""This is not in line with resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations. This has reduced the authority of the committee as a main anti-terrorism body of the UNSC and this is not conducive to the solidarity and only complicates the issue,"" Geng said. ""We urge the US to act cautiously and avoid forcefully moving forward this resolution draft,"" China said, using unusually blunt language as the Trump administration made good its expressed intent to take the JeM chief's issue to the UNSC since the sanctions committee had been repeatedly thwarted. Adding to the friction was US secretary of state Mike Pompeo calling out the contradiction of China's forcible detention of Uighur Muslims while supporting terror groups like JeM. ""The world cannot afford China's shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other, it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the UN,"" Pompeo said. The US resolve in pushing China reflects a determination to press down on Pakistan in the wake of the JeM claiming responsibility for the suicide bombing in Pulwama despite its efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan, a strategy that is seen to require the cooperation of Pakistan. Its cruciality to US plans is seen as a factor that emboldens the Pakistan military to ""sanction"" a big attack in J&K. The US move means that China, if it doesn't lift the ""technical hold"", will likely have to explain publicly for the first time the rationale behind its support to the leader of a UN-designated terrorist group. It is understood that the next step for the council is to have informal discussions on the resolution. Though China as a permanent member can veto the draft resolution in the UNSC, the development further isolates Beijing at a time when the international community is running out of patience with Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism and China's decision to shield it. JeM's claim for the Pulwama attack only deepened the unease. Proceedings of the sanctions committee were in camera but a UNSC vote, if it comes to that, will be on record. The US-China clash over Azhar came against the backdrop of Pompeo meeting a delegation of Uighur Muslims, tens of thousands of whom are said to have been corralled in internment camps as Beijing tries to staunch what it sees as Islamic radicalism. If the council fails to arrive at a consensus, then it could consider putting the resolution to vote, leading to an open discussion. The US, France and the UK, which have worked together to bring the proposal, will hope in such a scenario that China, fearing isolation, abstains to allow the ban to go through.

 Pakistan seeks ‘further evidence’ on Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday shared its “preliminary findings” with the Indian government after examining the dossier handed over by New Delhi on the Pulwama suicide bombing carried out by terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). After a meeting of Pakistan foreign secretary Tehmina Janjua and the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad, Ajay Bisaria, Pakistan said it had sought “further information/ evidence” on the involvement of JeM. Pakistan’s foreign office said Janjua called Bisaria to his office in Islamabad and shared with him the findings on the Pulwama attack. Following the February 14 attack in Pulwama, Islamabad had rejected the allegation linking the attack to Pakistan. India, however, handed over a dossier to Pakistan on 27 February 2019, detailing the role of JeM - which has been operating from the Pakistan soil - in the Pulwama attack. Earlier, Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan had offered cooperation in the investigation if credible evidence was provided by India. The acceptance of the presence of JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar in Pakistan by foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in an interview has given credence to the Indian government’s claims that Pakistan has provided safe haven to JeM terrorists all along. In a statement issued after the meeting between Januja and Bisaria, the Foreign Office said: “Pakistan has acted with a high sense of responsibility and extended full cooperation.” The statement further added, “We do so in the interest of regional peace and security.

" Mine-protected vehicles, 30-seater buses for CRPF convoys in Kashmir: DG | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The CRPF will procure a new fleet of mine-protected vehicles (MPVs) and small 30-seater buses to ensure safety of its troop convoys in the Kashmir Valley, the chief of the force has said. The paramilitary force has also decided to enhance the number of its bomb detection and disposal squads (BDDS) for its about 65 battalions based in the Kashmir Valley for anti-terror and law and order duties. These new measures have been chalked out by the force in the aftermath of the   February 14 Pulwama terror attack   in which 40 personnel travelling in a bus, part of a convoy from Jammu to Srinagar, were martyred after a suicide bomber exploded a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED). ""We are enhancing our counter-IED capabilities in Kashmir. We are procuring and sending more MPVs and are bullet-proofing force buses. As it is difficult to armour large buses, we are looking at procuring small 30-seater buses that can be better armour plated,"" CRPF Director General (DG) R R Bhatnagar told PTI. The force uses MPVs for limited troop movements in the anti-Maoist operations and some of them are being used in Jammu and Kashmir too. About six personnel can travel in these four-wheeled vehicles. Bhatnagar said small buses can be better fabricated and equipped with bullet-resistant armour as compared to the standard large buses that seat 54-57 people. A similar large bus was blown up during the Pulwama attack. Officials said once a large bus is fabricated with bullet-proof sheets, its engine takes a toll and its speed and endurance is restricted due to the weight of the additional metal used for the armour. The CRPF chief said it has been decided to provide bomb detection and disposal squads to each battalion of the force deployed in the Kashmir Valley and those units which had them will see an increase in the number of personnel and equipment to detect and counter explosives and IEDs. Seats have been increased in the Pune-based IED education school of the force so that more personnel are trained in the trade of detection and disarming such bombs in Kashmir, Bhatnagar said. The bullet-proof armour to the buses will only save force personnel from firing attacks by terrorists and will not provide fool-proof protection from explosions like the one that was carried out in Pulwama, a senior officer said. To counter Pulwama-like attacks, new procedures for convoy movement and protection have been notified, he added. The new convoy movement procedure involves restricting the movement of civilian vehicles, regularly changing halting points and dynamic movement of convoys to and from the Kashmir Valley, he said. Facing criticism for allowing large convoys to ply on roads in an operationally sensitive area like Jammu and Kashmir, the home ministry had announced last month that all jawans and officers of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) deployed in the Kashmir Valley can now take a commercial flight while going in to join duty or for tour and while proceeding on leave. The CRPF cavalcade that came under attack on February 14 had seventy-eight vehicles and the ill-fated bus was fifth in line. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Jammu and kashmir:   Army personnel martyred in LoC firing by Pakistan | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: An Army personnel was martyred Sunday in firing by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district, officials said.

India has made it clear to Pakistan that cross-border terror attacks and talks cannot go hand in hand. India last year called off a planned meeting of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and her Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi on the sidelines of the annual session of the UN General Assembly in New York after blaming Pakistan-based entities for killing of three special police officers in Kashmir.

"NIA registers ‘open FIR’ against JeM, Masood Azhar’s brother and others | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: A month after the Pulwama attack, the National Investigation Agency has registered an “open FIR” against Jaish-e-Mohammed and its leaders in India and Pakistan — including Masood Azhar’s brother Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar, Muddasir Khan and six others — to investigate the outfit’s plans to carry out more attacks across India. Azhar, who is admitted in a Pakistani hospital, has not been named in the FIR. Sources said the purpose of the open FIR was to nab its underground cadres, sleeper cells, sympathisers and those who help the outfit financially and logistically in different cities across India. It will also help stop future attacks and make a strong case detailing the outfit's terror plans, which are carried out with the help of the Pakistani government and its spy agency ISI. The agency on Friday took custody of Sajjad Khan, a close aide of Muddasir Khan. Sources said Sajjad was sent by JeM to Delhi to carry out reconnaissance of important targets, set up a hideout in the city, radicalise and recruit Muslim youth of Uttar Pradesh and other states, provide them training in weapons, explosives and field craft, besides raising funds. Sajjad was operating under the guise of a shawl vendor. Sources said the open FIR also means the NIA can investigate the role of J&K separatists and other outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen in collaborating with JeM for terror activities in India. It will help India prepare a detailed dossier on JeM’s activities, further strengthening its quest to get the outfit’s leaders banned by UN Security Council. NIA had registered a similar open FIR against Islamic State in 2016, following which a massive crackdown began against the outfit’s activities in India and those trying to join it. Recently, in a dossier submitted to Pakistan, India had provided details on JeM’s rallies, meetings and training camps run from POK and territories like Manshera, Bahawalpur and other areas. NIA and intelligence sources said the outfit was funded by business interests and so-called Islamic charitable foundations. It received funding from Gulf countries and the Pakistani government and ISI. The group is provided with sophisticated weapons, explosives, technical equipment and military training by the Pakistan Army. The JeM runs a charity called Al-Rehmat Trust, which collects donations in the garb of helping families of mujahideen (terrorists). Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Imran Khan says no room for 'jihadi outfits and culture' in Pakistan - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: There was no room for ""jihadi outfits and jihadi culture"" in Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan has said amidst intense global pressure on his government to rein in the terrorist outfits operating from its soil after the Pulwama attack. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) killed 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district in February 14. India launched a counter-terror operation in Balakot. The next day, Pakistan air force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured its pilot, who was handed over to India on March 1. Talking to editors and senior journalists in Islamabad, Khan said that India's NDA government wants to win the general election based on its politics of hatred against Pakistan, a newspaper reported. He warned that the security risk at the Line of Control (LoC) persists until elections are held in India and asked the nation to be prepared at all times. The armed forces of the country are ever ready and would give a befitting response in case of any military aggression, the prime minister said. Khan said that all the political parties have agreed to the National Action Plan and by now the militant groups have been proscribed. Further action was being taken against them as his government could not allow any such activity on the soil of Pakistan. Tracing the history of jihadi outfits and ""jihadi culture"", he said ""these groups have existed since the days of the US-led Afghan war against the Soviets in Afghanistan, and have operated from here for decades"", Dawn news reported. He said that there was no room now for any such group in the country, as Pakistan would like the world to believe that it was not only a peace-loving country but it was sincere in eradicating this culture of ""jihadism"" and terrorism through short-term and long-term policies. Khan said that India was trying to push Pakistan in the blacklist of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and if that happened, the country would be facing a lot of economic problems. The international terror financing watchdog FATF last month decided to continue the 'Grey' listing of Pakistan for its failure to stop funding of terrorist groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamat-ud-Dawa. In June 2018, Pakistan was placed in the 'Grey' list and given a 27-point action plan by the FATF. This Plan was reviewed as the last Plenary in October 2018 and for the second time in this week-long meeting. Speaking about the law and order situation in the country, Khan said that banned organisations should have been eliminated a long time ago, but it was his government which was taking action against them. He said that the government was spending huge amount of money to bring them into the mainstream. The US has warned Pakistan that another terror attack on India will prove to be ""extremely problematic"" as it asked Islamabad to take more ""concrete and sustained"" actions to rein in terror groups including the JeM and the LeT.

""The choice is Pakistan's,"" the senior administration official asserted. While the situation between the two south Asian neighbours have de-escalated, the two armies are still on high alert and that concerns the US, the official said. ""So, we realize that if there, God forbid, would be another terrorist attack that you could quickly see the escalation in the situation once again. So that's why, we're making clear that any additional military action by either side runs an unacceptably high risk, for both countries and for the region,"" the official said. The Trump administration, the official said, has taken sort of a ""zero tolerance policy"" on the issue of safe havens to terrorists. ""The terrorist attack on February 14th on India was a demonstration that Pakistan's continuing provision of sanctuary for any terrorist group is not acceptable,"" the official said. During the height of the crisis -- February 26-28 -- the United States was in continuous contact with Indian and Pakistani officials, both on the ground in New Delhi and Islamabad. ""They were working the phones continuously and were deeply engaged in seeking to deescalate what was a very dangerous moment in India-Pakistan relations,"" the official said. The United States has also reached out to influential countries to have them help deescalate the situation, the senior administration official said. Some of these countries are China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan and Australia.

" BJP trying to turn Lok Sabha polls into 'khaki election', says Shashi Tharoor | India News - Times of India","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Lok Sabha polls should be fought on ""perennial issues"" like poverty and disease and not on a ""tragedy of one moment"", says Congress leader Shashi Tharoor while accusing the BJP-led government of trying to turn the 2019 vote into a ""khaki election"" after the Pulwama attack. The momentum was with the Congress when the Pulwama tragedy struck on February 14, killing 40 CRPF soldiers, Tharoor said, hitting out at the government for trying to make the upcoming Lok Sabha polls a ""national security-based election"". ""We were doing very well by all estimations and the momentum was with us when the Pulwama tragedy struck us.

In his view, a ""daily terror"" of hunger, poverty and disease strikes the hearts of millions of India and the government must deal with that too. ""I am not minimising national security, but I am saying that the election has to be fought on perennial issues and not on a tragedy of one moment.

According to the Thiruvananthapuram MP, there has been a dramatic change in the character of India under BJP rule. An estimated 97 per cent of all communal violent incidents relating to cow vigilantism have happened in last four years, Tharoor said. ""And those are figures issued by the home ministry of Rajnath Singh. Not by Congress, not by any NGO. These are government figures. These are very serious crises,"" he said. Lashing out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said ""triumphant majoritarianism celebrates violence"" and the ""prime minister stays silent"". ""So the condoning of this kind of thing is a deep assault on the very foundations of our democracy,"" the former Union minister said. He said there are attempts by the Centre to undermine the constitutional arrangement that India was a country for all religions. ""That's being undermined in the ruling party's language and rhetoric and is also undermined by steps like the Citizenship Amendment Bill which will allow every citizen of a neighbouring country except Muslims to settle here. That kind of bigotry was never part of Indian nationhood,"" he said. Tharoor also expressed the hope that the people of India will vote out the BJP as the party doesn't deserve a second chance. Addressing the issue of farmer distress, he said, ""Sadly, more farmers are committing suicide than there are victims of terrorism in India. I am not saying we should minimise ... we should also keep our country safe, but we want the people to address the existing real problems which includes major levels of agrarian distress.

'Fencing along Gujarat border by March 2020' | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: The recent Pulwama attack has once again drawn the attention to the issue of incomplete border fencing on the Gujarat-Pakistan borders. According to the Union home ministry, nearly 60km of fencing along the Gujarat-Pakistan border is incomplete.  While replying to a question by MP Devusinh Chauhan, Union minister of state for home, Kiren Rijiju said that Gujarat and Pakistan share a 508km border, of which fencing is possible only along 340km.

" Pakistan should hand over Dawood, Salahuddin to India to show sincerity in tackling terror: Government sources | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: If Pakistan was sincere in tackling terror, then it should at least hand over to India Dawood Ibrahim, Syed Salahuddin and other terrorists who are Indian citizens and residing in that country, government sources said on Saturday. They said Pakistan has failed to take any credible action against Jaish-e-Muhammed and other terror groups even after the dastardly Pulwama attack. If Pakistan really wants to send a message that it was serious about addressing India's concerns over terrorism, then it should hand over Dawood, Salahuddin and other terrorists who are Indians, the sources said. Referring to actions by Pakistan such as holding certain terrorists in preventive custody, the sources said India considered them to be cosmetic. Cosmetic action will not cut any ice. India has been asking Pakistan to hand over Dawood, Salahuddin and several other terrorists who are wanted in India in connection with a series of terror attacks. The sources said India has shared various key details such as coordinates of terror groups operating from Pakistan soil to Islamabad which can be verified by a third country. After the Pulwama terror attack, India has mounted a diplomatic offensive to corner Pakistan internationally on the issue of terrorism. India has been pressing for concrete and verifiable action by Pakistan against terror groups operating from Pakistani soil. Tension between the two nuclear-armed neighbours escalated after the February 14 Pulwama terror attack and subsequent aerial strike by India on a training camp of the Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) in Balakot on February 26. Pakistan retaliated the strike next day by unsuccessfully attempting to target Indian military installations. The JeM claimed responsibility for the Pulwama attack.

" India, US seek tangible and irreversible action by Pakistan against terrorists | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: The US and India have asked Pakistan to take ""tangible and irreversible action"" against terrorist groups on its soil and deny safe haven to them to launch cross-border attacks, as Washington reiterated its firm support to New Delhi in the fight against terrorism. The US' support to India was expressed by America's national security advisor John Bolton during a meeting with foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale on Wednesday. ""Met with Indian FS Gokhale to advance progress on the US-India strategic partnership & our shared vision for the Indo-Pacific, as well as reiterate that the US stands shoulder-to-shoulder with India in the fight against terrorism,"" Bolton said in a tweet. Post the February 14 Pulwama attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) that left 40 CRPF personnel dead, Bolton and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have emerged as strong supporters of the India-US relationship. ""Both (Gokhale and Bolton) underlined the importance of Pakistan taking tangible and irreversible action against terrorist groups based in territories under its control and denial of safe haven for these groups to launch cross -border attacks,"" the Indian Embassy said in a readout of the meeting. The US support came on the day when China for the fourth time blocked a bid to get Pakistan-based JeM chief Masood Azhar designated as a global terrorist by the UN Security Council. China put a technical hold on the move by the US, the UK and France, seeking ""more time to examine"" the proposal, a diplomat at the United Nations has told PTI. A day after the Pulwama attack, Bolton had told his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval that the US supports India's right to self-defence as tensions escalated with Pakistan.

In an address at a think tank on Modi government's foreign policy, she said Pakistan was worried that India would escalate the situation and she was contacted by a number of foreign ministers over it. ""I used to receive calls from foreign ministers who used to first condole the Pulwama attack, then express their solidarity and then they used to softly say that we think India will not escalate the situation,"" she said.

"Masood Azhar: Failure to designate Masood Azhar as global terrorist against regional stability, peace: US | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar meets the criteria to be designated as a global terrorist and not doing so is against regional stability and peace, the US said on Tuesday on the eve of the UN Security Council making a crucial decision in this regard. The JeM, headed by the 50-year-old Azhar, carried out many terror strikes in India and was involved in the attack on Parliament, the Pathankot air force base, army camps in Jammu and Uri, and the latest suicide attack on CRPF in Pulwama which claimed the lives of 40 personnel. US, UK, France bring fresh proposal for UNSC ban on Jaish chief Masood AzharIn the aftermath of the February 14 attack in Pulwama, three permanent members of the UNSC — the United States, Britain and France — have moved a resolution to designate Azhar as a global terrorist. Govt intensifies offensive to get Masood Azhar sanctioned at UNSeveral previous attempts by these three countries inside the UN Security Council were blocked by China, the all-weather ally of Pakistan. China, which is one of the five veto-powered members of the Security Council, so far has been asserting that there is not enough evidence against Azhar to designate him as a global terrorist. Amidst a mounting global outrage in the wake of the Pulwama attack that led to a flare-up in tensions between India and Pakistan, US, Britain and France hope that Beijing would act wisely and would not oppose their move this time to designate Azhar as a global terrorist. On the eve of the crucial decision by the UN Security Council, the Trump Administration on Tuesday made it clear that there is enough evidence against Azhar to designate him as a global terrorist. ""Azhar is the founder and the leader of the JeM, and he meets the criteria for designation by the United Nations,"" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Robert Palladino told reporters at his daily news conference. The JeM, he said, has been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and is a threat to regional stability and peace. The US and India work closely together on counterterrorism efforts, and that includes at the United Nations, he added, noting that their views on the Jaish-e-Mohammed and its founder are well known. However, he refrained from making a direct comment on the deliberations inside the UN on this issue. ""The United Nations Sanctions Committee, their deliberations, are confidential, and as such we don't comment on specific matters, but we'll continue to work with the Sanctions Committee to ensure that the designation list is updated and accurate,"" Palladino said. ""The United States and China share a mutual interest in achieving regional stability and peace, and that a failure to designate Azhar would run counter to this goal,"" Palladino said in response to a question on previous successful attempts by China to block the UN designation of Azhar.

Lok Sabha elections 2019:  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal: BJP will not benefit from Pulwama | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: BJP’s attempts to gain political mileage from the Pulwama attack and subsequent tension on Indo-Pak border have backfired, chief minister and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday. He claimed that this had been revealed by a survey conducted by the party between March 5 and 6, covering 5 lakh people. He added that the survey also showed that AAP is capable of defeating BJP alone on all seven seats. “In response to a question whether BJP will gain or lose because of Pulwama and subsequent Indo-Pak tension, 56% of the respondents did not approve of BJP’s politics and said the party will suffer losses,” he said at a press conference at AAP headquarters. “People have said that they knew for the past two years that BJP will definitely create some lafra (sic) before elections.” “The number of people who want to defeat Modiji is more than those who are Modi bhakts. The Modi-Shah duo is dangerous for the country,” said Kejriwal adding that AAP will do anything to save the country. Kejriwal accused all governments at the Centre of deceiving people on full statehood. “The people of Telangana, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and other states achieved statehood through relentless struggles and the people of Delhi will follow a similar path and will not rest till they achieve their goal. This is the only issue for the seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi,” said Kejriwal The chief minister said that since February 2015, his government had done whatever it could in education, health, electricity and water. He said the solution for the poor law and order situation, unemployment, safety for women, and other problems can be found only when Delhi becomes a full state. “Delhi is facing a serious shortage of colleges and it is an extremely serious matter that despite getting over 95% marks in Class XII board exams, students of Delhi don’t get admission in Delhi colleges. This needs to be urgently addressed. Employees on contract should have been regularized but the Centre has no interest. Traders are facing a lot of hardship due to sealings but the Central government is sleeping,” he added, reiterating that full statehood was the answer. Kejriwal and other AAP leaders will on Wednesday burn the 2014 election manifesto of BJP which promised full statehood as a mark of protest.

 How the political discourse has changed in 100 days | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Mar 12, 2019)(This article was originally published by The Economic Times on 12/03/2019.) The 100 days before Lok Sabha elections were announced on March 10 have been very eventful. From reservation to economically weaker sections to war clouds, the political narrative kept changing. ET takes a look at the major events that could impact the polls: Farmer is King Congress waived farm loans soon after it formed government in MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. In December, West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand announced direct cash transfers for farmers, ranging from Rs 5,000 per acre to Rs 10,000 per family per year. It forced the Centre to rethink and come up with a PM Kisan scheme in the Budget to provide Rs 6,000 per year to every farmer who has up to five acres. Reservations For All The SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act became an election issue in MP and Rajasthan. To contain BJP’s losses, the NDA government introduced 10 per cent reservation for economically backward class with annual income up to Rs 8 lakh. Rajasthan introduced a bill for 5 per cent reservation to Gurjars and four other communities above existing OBC quota on February 13. Andhra implemented EWS reservation with 5-10 per cent quota to Kapus who make 27 per cent of the state population. MP issued an ordinance to raise state OBC quota to 27 per cent from 14 per cent on March 6. The Centre overturned a court verdict to restore 200-point roaster system for faculty reservation in universities on February 28. CBI Crisis The Supreme Court restored Alok Verma as CBI director on January 8 overruling the Modi government’s decision to bench him. On January 11, Verma quit after he was shunted out from CBI. Before this, the CBI extradited Christian Michel from Dubai on December 6 in the Agusta Westland case. In another case on February 3, the CBI team which reached the residence of Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar to examine him in the Saradha chit fund case was detained by the Kolkata police leading to a government-opposition show down. Mandir Mediation BJP raised the Mandir pitch during the last round of assembly elections and several party leaders demanded an Ordinance for construction of a Ram Temple. Hearing on the Ayodhya title dispute continued in the apex court and on February 1, the Vishva Hindu Parishad put off the demand on Ram Temple till Lok Sabha elections concluded. The decision was endorsed by the RSS. On March 8, SC ordered formation of a mediation panel to look for an out of court solution. Fight Over Rafale On December 14, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea to probe the Rafale jets deal. On February 13, CAG tabled its audit report which claimed that the NDA deal was 2.86 per cent cheaper. However the CAG also said that the deal could have been even cheaper as banking guarantees were waived. It gave some ammunition to the opposition but the Balakot air strike saw erasure of the discourse. Prime Minister Modi said that Rafale could have made a difference in India’s air capability. Publication of Rafale documents in The Hindu led to fresh controversy on March 4, with the AG claiming that it was stolen documents. He later denied that the documents were not stolen. Pulwama and Balakot The terror attack on CRPF convoy on February 14 in Pulwama was followed by February 26 bombing of Jaish-e-Mohammad camp in Balakot by the Indian Air Force. Pakistan fighter jets entered Indian border the next day, resulting in a dog fight. In the process, Pakistan captured Wing Commander Abhinandan but released him on March 1. Pulwama and Balakot gave fresh political momentum for the ruling BJP, while the opposition got together to redraw strategies. Priyanka’s Debut On January 23, Priyanka Gandhi joined active politics and was made general secretary in-charge of East UP. On February 11, she went on a road show in Lucknow with her brother, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, and held meetings of party workers from East UP. There has been no word about her activities post-Balakot. Her joining politics coincided with legal teams of the Enforcement Directorate examining her husband Robert Vadra. Alliances and Poll PactsNDA: RLSP quit NDA on December 10 and joined the opposition grand alliance in Bihar. BJP quickly finalized seat sharing with JDU on December 23. On February 18, BJP sealed an alliance with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and a day later it sealed an alliance with AIADMK and PMK in Tamil Nadu. SP and BSP announced alliance on January 12 leaving two seats for RLD. RLD and SP announced alliance on March 5 to contest three seats. SP left one seat for RLD. Opposition: Despite several meetings, the Opposition, especially Congress, has not been able to announce its alliances. On February 13, opposition leaders met at Sharad Pawar residence and decided to have prepoll alliance and a common minimum programme. The strategy was hit after the Pulwama attack the very next day. Congress partners in Bihar, Karnataka and Maharashtra want more seats and the party is yet to concede space to smaller parties. Congress has only announced an alliance in TN and with Mahan Dal in UP. The party has announced it was not tying up with AAP in Delhi, on March 11, after much back and forth. In Bihar, RJD has given a March 13 ultimatum to Congress to resolve its issues. Congress’ Income GuaranteeWhile addressing a rally on January 28 in Raipur, Congress president Rahul Gandhi announced that if Congress returns to power, the party would implement a scheme that would ensure minimum income for every poor family of the country. The scheme was being planned as part of Congress manifesto. Anticipating a similar announcement in the budget, Gandhi unveiled Congress’ plan for an early lead. Tax ReliefThe NDA government introduced income-tax waiver for employees earning up to Rs 5 lakh per annum in the interim budget. Ordinances RuleOn February 28, the Union Cabinet cleared five ordinances. Apart from law to restore faculty reservation in universities, another ordinance was to amend the Aadhaar Act, allowing individuals to voluntarily use it for identification. On February 19, ordinance for banning instant triple talaq was repromulgated. The bill passed twice by the Lok Sabha has been stuck in the RS. Another ordinance was to ban unregulated deposit schemes to curb ponzi schemes. There was a speculation the Centre may promulgate an ordinance for amending the Citizenship Act but following severe opposition from parties in the northeast, it was not considered.

" Indian defence lab develops 'combat drugs' to reduce casualties in Pulwama-type attacks, warfare | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: With 90 per cent of gravely wounded security personnel succumbing to injuries within a few hours, Defence Research and Development Organisation's (DRDO) medical laboratory has come up with a range of 'combat casualty drugs' that can extend the golden hour till the trooper is shifted to hospital. The spectrum includes bleeding wound sealants, super absorptive dressings and glycerated salines, all of which can save lives in the event of warfare in jungle and high altitude areas as well as in terror attacks, scientists said. Citing the   February 14 terror attack in Pulwama   where 40 CRPF soldiers were martyred, they said the medicines could have brought down the death toll. According to developers of the drugs at the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, a laboratory of the DRDO , chances of survival and minimum disability are highest when effective first aid care is given within the golden hour. Scientists at INMAS, entrusted with research and development in a number of areas concerning the defence sector, said the main battlefield emergencies are excess bleeding, sepsis, shock, hypovolemia (decreased blood volume) and pain. DRDO's indigenously made medicines will be a boon for paramilitary and defence personnel during warfare, said AK Singh, director general of life sciences at the organisation. ""These medicines will ensure that our brave soldiers do not suffer from unwanted blood loss while being taken to a better healthcare from war zones,"" he told PTI. The challenges are many. There is only one medical person and limited equipment to take care of soldiers during combat in most cases. This is compounded by battlefield conditions such as forests, hilly terrain and inaccessibility of vehicles, experts said. Among the drugs developed is glycerated saline, a battlefield intravenous fluid that does not freeze till -18 degrees Celsius and is useful in handling trauma cases in high altitude areas. According to Manju Bala Popli, senior scientist at INMAS, glycerated saline, unlike normal saline, reduces inflammation. The drug can be life saving, particularly if the traumatic edema, collection of fluid in tissues and cavities of the body, is in the brain or lungs. ""Glycerated saline has life saving capacities as it gives more time to the medical personnel to shift the wounded patient to a higher care facility,"" Popli said. INMAS has also developed a special medicated dressing material which is 200 times more absorptive than normal dressings during bleeding wounds. Amit Tyagi, another senior scientist at INMAS and part of the team behind developing the drug, said the cellulose fibre-based dressings are more effective in stopping bleeding and keeping the wound clean. Additionally, antiseptics, antibiotics and curcumin can be impregnated in the dressing which acts as a slow drug release system, said a note prepared by INMAS on the medicines developed by it. ""Normal cotton dressing used for bleeding wounds has sub optimal absorptive capacity and is soiled after sometime. In heavily bleeding wounds, putting a normal dressing can actually enhance the bleeding by sucking out the blood,"" said INMAS scientist Gaurav Mittal. ""It is safer and more effective to put in a long stuffed absorptive strip rather than individual gauge pieces. It has four-five times higher capacity to absorb blood,"" he said. Then there is Chitosan gel, which helps in preventing blood loss by forming a film over the wound. Coupled with platelets and red blood cells aggregation, it stops the bleeding. Its antibacterial and wound health properties are of added benefit. ""Chitosan gel is suitable for sealing wounds by twin action: haemostasis by chemical action and filing action. It can be used for wounds on the limbs and also cavities such as abdomen and thorax,"" INMAS director Tarun Sekhri told PTI. The gel is poured onto the wound and held with physical pressure for few minutes till the bleeding stops, he said. ""It is topped by Chitosan wound cover. If the wound is deep, filters like silk and cellulose granules may be used after Chitosan gel,"" he explained. The products developed for jungle warfare are at the stage of implementation, said Aseem Bhatnagar, additional director of the institute. ""The Ministry of Home Affairs has recommended the cost-effective drugs to be inducted into their paramilitary forces while efforts are on with other forces for induction,"" he said. Part of the range is hypochlorous acid (HoCL), a disinfectant for troopers involved in jungle warfare. It is helpful in treating necrotising fascitis, a rapidly progressing bacterial infection of soft tissues. Bacterial toxins cause local tissue damage and necrosis, as well as blunt immune system responses. In such cases, pure 0.01 per cent HoCL has both broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and can rapidly neutralise bacterial toxins. Bhatnagar said jungle warfare wounds have significant infection risk. The standard approach is to treat them with antibiotics. However, overuse and misuse of antibiotics often leads to breeding resistant strains of superbugs. ""A safe and effective alternative method for managing infected wounds is by using a more non-traditional cleansing agent. While the use of HoCL does not obviate the need for antibiotic, it augments treatment and speed of wounds healing. Undesirable side effects and antibiotics resistance gets reduced,"" Bhatnagar said. INMAS scientists have also discovered a new route for administering the Nalbuphine injection to reduce pain during mutilating war injuries. The scientists have discovered that 10 mg injection of Nalbuphine hydrochloride is more effective for an injured trooper if it is given through the submental/sublingual route instead of intra-muscular or intravenous route.

 Pulwama terror attack mastermind identified as 23-year-old electrician: Officials | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Lesser-known Jaish-e-Muhammed terrorist Mudasir Ahmed Khan, alias 'Mohd Bhai', has been identified as the brains behind the audacious terror strike in Pulwama that left 40 CRPF personnel dead on February 14, officials said on Sunday. Piecing together evidence gathered so far, security officials said that 23-year-old Khan, an electrician with a graduate degree hailing from Pulwama district, arranged the vehicle and explosives used in the terror strike. A resident of Mir Mohalla of Tral, Khan joined Jaish-e-Muhammed sometime in 2017 as an overground worker and was later drawn into the JeM fold by Noor Mohammed Tantrey, alias 'Noor Trali', who is believed to have helped revive the terror outfit in the Valley. After Tantray was killed in December 2017, Khan disappeared from his home on January 14, 2018 and has been active since then. Suicide attacker Adil Ahmed Dar, who blew his explosive-laden vehicle next to a bus in a CRPF convoy on February 14, had been in constant contact with Khan, they said. After completing his graduation, Khan did a one-year diploma course as electrician from an Industrial Training Institute (ITI). The eldest son of a labourer, Khan is also believed to be involved in the terror strike at the Army camp in Sunjawan in February 2018, in which six personnel and a civilian were killed. His role has also come under lens in the Lethpora attack on a CRPF camp in January 2018 that left five CRPF personnel dead. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the February 14 terror attack, had carried out searches at the residence of Khan on February 27. A Maruti Eeco minivan was used in the Pulwama terror attack and it was bought by another Jaish-e-Muhammed operative just 10 days before the strike. The JeM operative, identified as Sajjad Bhat, a resident of Bijbehara in south Kashmir, has since been on the run and is believed to have become an active terrorist now, they said.

 'New Pakistan' with 'nayi soch' should show new action against terrorist groups: India | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India on Saturday said if Pakistan claims to be a ""naya Pakistan"" with ""nayi soch"", it should show ""naya action"" against terrorist groups and their infrastructure on its soil and end cross-border terrorism in support of its claims. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, at a media briefing, also said its non-military strike on JeM camp in Pakistan achieved its desired objective and demonstrated the country's firm resolve to take decisive action against cross border terrorism. An Indian Air Force MiG-21 Bison, piloted by Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, shot down a Pakistan Air Force F-16 fighter aircraft and there were eyewitness accounts and electronic evidence for it, said Kumar. ""We have also shared   evidence in the form of parts of AMRAAM missile   which were recovered from the site and are only carried by F-16 aircraft of the PAF,"" he said. ""Our non-military counter-terrorism strike achieved the desired objective. It has demonstrated our firm resolve to take decisive action against cross border terrorism,"" he said. Only one aircraft was lost by India during Pakistan's unsuccessful attempt at targeting Indian military installations, he said. Kumar also said if, as Pakistan claims, it has evidence of downing of second Indian aircraft then why has it not shared it. Since the Pulwama terror attack the international community has stood by India, Kumar said. It is unfortunate that Pakistan still continues to deny JeM's own claim of carrying out the Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed, he said. Kumar asserted that Pakistan-based terror groups were conducting their activities without any hindrance. Pakistan must show credible, verifiable and sustained action against terror groups operating from its soil, he said. On the issue of the fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi's extradition, the MEA spokesperson said the UK is still considering India's request.

 MEA spokesperson on India-Pakistan situation: Full text | India News - Times of India,"The ministry of external affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar on Saturday asserted that Pakistan-based terror groups were conducting their activities without any hindrance. Pakistan must show credible, verifiable and sustained action against terror groups operating from its soil, he said during a media briefing. Below is the full text of the briefing: 1. You are all aware of the developments following the heinous terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir State, on 14 February, that was executed by the Pakistan-based and UN-proscribed terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed. The foreign secretary and the spokespersons of our Armed Forces have already briefed the media on the action taken by us against the Jaish-e-Mohammed. 2. Our non-military counter terrorism strike of 26 February achieved the intended objective. It has demonstrated our firm resolve to take decisive action against cross-border terrorism. 3. On 27 February Pakistan, instead of taking action against terrorist groups on its soil, chose to escalate through an act of aggression by violating our air space and attempting, unsuccessfully, to target our military facilities. Their action was effectively thwarted by the alertness and readiness of our armed forces. 4. We have been transparent and open in informing the media on 27 February itself that, in the process of defending our national sovereignty and territorial integrity, one MiG 21 Bison was lost in action and Wing Commander Abhinandan had to bail out and landed in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Pakistan, however, continues to propagate a false narrative of the events of that day. 5. The statement by our Indian Air Force is in the public domain. Only one aircraft was lost by us. If, as Pakistan claims, they have a video recording of the downing of a second Indian aircraft, why have they not shown it to the international media even after more than one week? Questions should be asked to them as to where the fuselage of the aircraft is and what has happened to the pilots? As we have already said, there are eye-witness accounts and electronic evidence that Pakistan deployed F-16 aircraft and that one F-16 was shot down by Wing Commander Abhinandan. Evidence of the use of AMRAAM Missile, which can only be deployed on the F-16 with Pakistan, has also been shown to the media. Pakistan should explain why it continues to deny that its F-16 aircraft has been shot down? We have asked the United States to also examine whether the use of F16 against India is in accordance with the terms and conditions of sale. 6. Since the Pulwama attack, the international community has solidly stood with India in their condemnation of the attack as well as in asking Pakistan to take concrete action against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure in territories under the control of Pakistan. The United Nations Security Council unanimously issued a Press Statement in which they have explicitly referred to the Jaish-e-Mohammed as having claimed responsibility for the attack. The UN Security Council Press Statement also calls for perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terrorism to be held accountable and brought to justice. It is regrettable that Pakistan still continues to deny Jaish-e-Mohammed’s own claim of taking ownership of the Pulwama attack. In his interview to BBC on 1 March, Pakistan foreign minister said, and I quote “they have not claimed responsibility of that (Pulwama attack). There is some confusion on that. The confusion is that the leadership has been contacted and they said no” unquote. Is Pakistan defending the Jaish-e-Mohammed and acting as its spokesperson? Does Pakistan’s claim have any credibility? 7. In 2004, the then President of Pakistan had made a solemn public commitment that they would not allow any territory under their control to be used for terrorist activity in any manner. But till today, however, Pakistan has failed to take any credible action against Jaish-e-Mohammed and other terrorist organizations, which continue to operate with impunity from Pakistan. The widespread presence of terrorist camps in Pakistan is a public knowledge within and outside Pakistan. Repeated requests by us and the international community for Pakistan to take action against such groups has been met with denial. 8. Since 26 February, following demands from the international community, Pakistan is again claiming to take fresh action against terror groups on its soil. In an interview to CNN on 28 February, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan has said, and I quote “Well, he is (Masood Azhar) in Pakistan according to my information” unquote. Claims are being made that terrorist organizations will be proscribed, that some individuals have been placed in preventive detention and that some action has been taken against seminaries and madrassas belonging to terrorist groups. We are seeing the same script that has been played out earlier after the terrorist attacks on our Parliament in December 2001, the Mumbai terrorist attack in November 2008 and the attack on Pathankot airbase in January 2016. Pakistan claims to proscribe groups and individuals, but this is confined only on paper. Actually, terrorist groups and individuals continue their activities without hindrance. Pakistan has not shown any serious intent to address the legitimate concerns of India and the global community. 9. Despite the media interviews by Pakistan’s Foreign Minister and former President Musharraf acknowledging the presence of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Pakistan, the spokesperson of the Pakistan armed forces openly denied the presence of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Pakistan, in an interview on 6 March. This statement is a sufficient proof that Pakistan still remains in a state of denial. 10. We remain resolute in our determination to persuade the international community of the necessity of compelling Pakistan to move beyond mere words and to show credible, verifiable and sustained actions. We have, and we will continue to act with responsibility and maturity. Our armed forces continue to maintain strict vigil and will remain determined in the defence of the nation and its citizens. 11. If Pakistan claims to be a “naya Pakistan with nayi soch”, it should show “naya action” against terrorist groups and terror infrastructure on its soil and end cross border terrorism in support of its claims.

" After Digvijaya, video shows UP deputy CM calling Pulwama attack 'big accident' | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: A day after some BJP leaders and Prime Minister Narendra Modi targeted Congress leader Digvijaya Singh for calling Pulwama strike an ""accident"", a video has surfaced showing their own leader and Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya calling the February 14 terror attack a ""big accident"". ""There was no lapse in security and it was a 'badi durghatna' (big accident) involving our CRPF jawans. The Prime Minister had said that the armed forces have been given a free hand. Whatever action needs to be taken would be done by the armed forces. The Prime Minister does not need to say any further,"" Maurya had said in the video on February 21, according to news agency ANI. On March 4, Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh had described the Pulwama attack as an ""accident,"" drawing sharp criticism from BJP. Digvijaya Singh had said: After the Pulwama ""durghatna"" (accident) and the Indian Air Force (IAF) strike, ""sande""(doubt) is being expressed in some foreign media reports following which ""vishwasniyata"" (credibility) of the government is under question. Speaking at a rally on Tuesday, PM Modi, without naming Digvijaya Singh, said ""a leader termed the Pulwama attack as an ""accident"" and dubbed slain al-Qaida terrorist Osama bin Laden as an ""ambassador of peace"".""

NEW DELHI: India is exploring the possibility of expanding its anti-terror partnership with Iran to counter terrorist activities allegedly launched from Pakistan’s soil, sources told ET. A day before the Pulwama terror attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad last month, a suicide bomber had killed 27 elite Revolutionary Guards and left several others wounded in Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan border province. The Jaish al-Adl, a terrorist group based in Pakistan and Sistan-Baluchestan, has claimed responsibility for the Iran attack. India and Iran accuse Pakistan and its intelligence service, the ISI, of lending support to terror outfits operating out of the country. ""India has ramped up its efforts to combat terrorist organisations on Pakistani soil and the Iranian and Indian governments have agreed to cooperate more closely on combating terrorism in the region,"" analyst Brian M Perkins wrote in an article titled ‘Iran: Jaish al-Adl Attack Could See Increased Iran-India Cooperation’, for leading US think-tank Jamestown Foundation. “Such an agreement could see an escalation of surreptitious military operations within Pakistan by its neighbours.” Major general Qassem Soleimani, the head of Islamic Revolution Guards Corps’ (IRGC’s) Quds Force (an elite unit), has warned Pakistan of retaliation if the Pakistan army and the ISI fail to act against what he termed as “state-sponsored terror groups”. The Quds Force has been at the forefront of the fight against the ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Iran’s Far News Agency recently quoted major general Mohammad Ali Jafari, the commander of the IRGC, as saying, ""We believe this silence is kind of support for this group and the Pakistani intelligence organisation should account for it. Pakistan should also know that it should pay the cost for the Pakistani intelligence organisation's support for Jaish al-Zolm (as Jaish ul-Adl is called in Iran) from now on and this price will no doubt be very heavy for them."" The general added that if Pakistan does not comply with its responsibilities, Iran “reserves the right of confrontation against these peripheral threats at the borders, based on international law and rules, and will adopt compensatory measures to punish the terrorists who are mercenaries of the regional and trans-regional states' spy agencies."" According to Far News Agency, Soleimani issued a stern warning to Pakistan saying, “I have this question for the Pakistani government: where are you heading to? You have caused unrest along borders with all your neighbours and do you have any other neighbour left that you want to stir insecurity for.""

Pak navy claims it thwarted Indian submarine from entering its waters - Times of India,"KARACHI: The Pakistan navy Tuesday claimed it had thwarted an attempt by an Indian submarine to enter the country's territorial waters. The report comes after tensions flared up between the two nuclear-armed neighbours following a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. Pakistan Navy also shared a footage with the media, which it said was ""actual"". The image showed that footage was made at 20.35 hours on March 4. ""The Pakistan Navy used its specialised skills to ward off the submarine, successfully keeping it from entering Pakistani waters,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. The Indian submarine was not deliberately targeted by the Pakistan to give peace a chance, the spokesperson said. ""The Indian submarine was not targeted keeping in view Pakistan's policy of peace,"" the official said, adding that India must learn from this incident and ""move towards peace"". ""The Pakistan Navy is always ready to guard its territorial waters and is capable of responding to any kind of aggression with full force,"" the navy said.

Sunil Lanba:   Have reports of terrorists being trained to carry out operations through sea: Navy chief | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Weeks after the   Pulwama attack   , Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba on Tuesday warned that there are reports about terrorists being trained to carry out operations through the sea. Addressing a gathering of global experts at the Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue in Delhi, Lanba said the Pulwama attack was perpetrated by extremists that were ""aided by a state"" that seeks to destabilise India. ""We also have reports of terrorists being trained to carry out operations in various modus operandi, including through the medium of the sea,"" he said. The 26/11 attack was carried out by 10 sea-borne terrorists of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, who hijacked an Indian fishing trawler to reach Mumbai and unleash mayhem. The Navy chief said this part of the world had witnessed multiple forms of terrorism in recent years and few countries in the region had been spared. The global nature that terrorism has acquired in the recent times has further enhanced the scope of this threat, Lanba said. India, however, faces a ""far more serious"" version of ""state-sponsored"" terrorism, he said. ""We recently saw the horrific scale of the extremist attack in Jammu and Kashmir about three weeks ago. This violence was perpetrated by extremists aided and abetted by a State that seeks to destabilise India,"" the Navy chief said without naming Pakistan. On February 14, a suicide bomber of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a bus in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district, killing 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel. ""We have seen how quickly terror groups evolve across the globe. A particular brand of terror can well become a global problem in near future,"" Lanba warned. The Indian security establishment is continuously working to address this menace, he said, noting that ""it is imperative that the global community works in concert to contain and eliminate terrorism in all its forms"". Lanba also emphasised the importance of the Indo-Pacific Region. ""There is a renewed focus of the world on the seas. This is principally due to the geoeconomic and geopolitical significance of the maritime domain."" India is a martime nation and, recently, there have been an increasing attention to harness potential of the maritime domain for the country's growth and regional development, he said. This event seeks to ""identify and conceptualise challenges and opportunities that lie in the waters, and evolve strategy for mutual benefits of all stakeholders,"" Lanba said. ""It is widely accepted that (the) Indo-Pacific Region has been growing in geopolitical significance in recent years due to economic, political and other reasons,"" he said. Lanba underlined the region's ancient and historical link with India and its significance for the country.

Shiv Sena: People have right to know casualties in IAF air strikes | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena Tuesday said India's citizens have the right to know about the casualties in the air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) camp in Pakistan and that revealing such information would not lower the morale of armed forces. Taking a dig at senior ally BJP, the Sena, in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana' said discussions over the air strikes will linger on till the upcoming Lok Sabha polls and ""burning issues"" raised by the Opposition before the February 14 Pulwama attack have now been side-stepped. ""Citizens of the country have the right to know what and how much harm has been caused to the enemy by the defence forces. We do not think the morale of our forces is being lowered by asking for it,"" it said. The Indian Air Force (IAF) jets on February 26 pounded JeM's biggest training camp in Pakistan in retaliation to the terror outfit's attack in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. While the government has so far not given any official figure of the casualties in the air strikes, some opposition parties have been asking for a proof of it. Referring to it, the Sena said, ""Where did the 300-kg RDX used in Pulwama attack come from? How many terrorists were killed in our strikes on terror camps? Discussions over these will happen till the last days of polls because before the Pulwama attack, inflation, unemployment and Rafale jet deal were the burning issues for the Opposition."" The Modi government's ""bomb"" has fallen over these issues, it said in sarcastic remarks. Issues like the construction of Ram temple, Article 370 and those raised by farmers have ""turned to ashes"", said the Uddhav Thackeray-led party, which is an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra. It said questions over the number of terrorists killed in the February 26 air strikes by IAF were not only being asked by the Opposition but by media of countries like the UK and the US as well.

"Airstrike in Pakistan's Balakot:  Airstrike was good response, but diplomacy is way forward: Former diplomat Latha Reddy | Bengaluru News - Times of India","BENGALURU: Former diplomat Latha Reddy, while applauding both the armed forces and the diplomats for their efforts, said that bravado, jingoism and domestic compulsions should not dictate how India acts against Pakistan. Instead, a patient diplomatic route should be seen as the best option. “We are proud of our armed forces and confident that they will do everything that is needed to be done for the country when pressed into action. But let’s not rush in to attack due to domestic compulsions. ...Bravado and jingoism should not dictate action as Pakistan has not changed fundamentally from what happened in Balakot or thereafter and it has not learnt any lesson,” Reddy said. Conceding that diplomacy is a slow tool, she still, however, advocated it to be the best option to deal with Pakistan given the neighbouring country’s geopolitical advantage that makes it very difficult for the West or the Gulf to completely isolate it. “Talking about what happened since Pulwama (the attack by JeM on February 14), I must say that in diplomatic terms it has been a success: Not a single country has censured India and neither has any country openly supported Pakistan. Our diplomats around the world have done well to prevent negative stand against India,” Reddy said. She, however, reiterated that such achievements do not happen overnight, and that the fruits of diplomacy are often results of very long relationships, friendships and other variables. “In the 1960s nobody supported us, In 1971 we had the USSR but in a limited way but today we have so much support from France, UK, US, Russia, the Arab world and so on, and these are all results of continuing efforts from the late 1990s. Also, the Indian economy and its growth has played a major role in garnering such support,” she said. Arguing that India should not get swayed away by domestic considerations, she said: “...Even during Kandahar we returned the terrorists because of media frenzy and domestic compulsions.” Lt Gen (retd) Prakash Menon, while stating that the Indian government had no choice but to respond to Pulwama, said it was, however, also important to note how our strike was projected thereafter. “If we think that with this we have managed to deter Pakistan from using terror as a front to further its foreign policy, then we are not completely right. The air strike and the message from it has only limited use. They will carry on,” Menon said. He said that while India wants to send a message that it today possess a greater political will that would use its armed forces in response to Pulwama-type attacks, we must understand that Pakistan may not be getting the same message. “Internationally India wants to enhance Pakistan’s isolation, but will we continue to get the same kind of global support if we continue to be more aggressive? It is a question worth asking given that Pakistan, despite the whole world agreeing that it is a state that harbours terrorism is also the most coveted thanks to the geopolitics,” Menon said. Prof Suba Chandran, dean, School of Conflict and Security Studies at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (Nias), argued how Pakistan’s behaviour post Pulwama, especially the way the country reacted after India’s strike has more to do with its problems on other sides of the border and global compulsions than what is being projected. Reddy and other experts spoke at a discussion on Pulwama, Balakot and the scenario thereafter organised at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.

Masood Azhar: Pakistan may withdraw its opposition to proposal to designate Azhar as global terrorist: Report | World News - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan may take ""decisive action"" against all proscribed organisations, including Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM), and even withdraw its opposition to the move to list terror outfit's chief   Masood Azhar   in the UN Security Council terror list, according to a media report on Sunday.   The US, the UK and France   on Wednesday moved a fresh proposal in the UN Security Council to designate Pakistan-based chief Azhar as a global terrorist, a listing that will subject him to global travel ban, asset freeze and arms embargo. In a major policy decision, Pakistan is set to take decisive action against all proscribed organisations as well as against the head of banned JeM, a senior security official familiar with the development was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune. It is not clear what specific action would be taken against Azhar but the official hinted that Pakistan may withdraw its opposition to the listing of JeM chief as global terrorist by the UN Security Council. ""The state has to decide whether individual is important or the larger national interest of the country,"" the official said when asked if Pakistan would no more oppose the UNSC action against Azhar. The Security Council Sanctions Committee will consider within 10 days on the fresh proposal moved by the three permanent veto-wielding members of the 15-nation Security Council. The proposal is the fourth such bid at the UN in the last 10 years to list Azhar as a global terrorist. In 2009, India moved a proposal to designate Azhar, whose UN-proscribed JeM claimed responsibility for the suicide attack against Indian security forces in Pulwama on February 14 in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed. In 2016 again, India moved the proposal with the P3 - the United States, the United Kingdom and France in the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee to ban Azhar, also the mastermind of the attack on the air base in Pathankot in January, 2016. In 2017, the P3 nations moved a similar proposal again. However, on all occasions, China, a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, blocked India's proposal from being adopted by the Sanctions Committee. The official, however, insisted that the move to take action against such individuals was taken before the Pulwama attack, the report said. He also clarified Pakistan's decision to act decisively was taken not to give any ""face saving"" to India. ""We need to correct ourselves in our own national interests and not someone else's,"" the official was quoted as saying in the report. The official further said that the Pakistani authorities had conducted investigations into the Pulwama terror attack on CRPF personnel and found ""no evidence whatsoever of any involvement of Pakistan or any organisation in it."" Stressing that the country's leadership was determined to take action against anyone found involved in the Pulwama attack, he said the dossier shared by India with Pakistan had nothing in it that suggested involvement of any Pakistani organisation.

"Baraat headed to Pakistan halts on way, marriage stalled | Jaipur News - Times of India","JAISALMER: The ongoing tension between India and Pakistan has also come to affect the people-to-people interactions. A recent case stands testimony to this predicament, wherein a marriage scheduled to be held in Pakistan had to be postponed in the wake of strained relations between the two nations in the aftermath of Pulwama attack and the IAF strike that followed. The ‘baraat’ (marriage procession) from Barmer district was to go to Pakistan by Thar Express for the wedding. Looking to the present conditions, the groom was concerned that ‘baraat’ might get stuck in Pakistan. The marriage was to be held on March 8 in Pakistan. People in the border villages in Jaisalmer and Barmer districts have their relatives in Amarkot state in Pakistan, and even today, ‘baraats’ come from Pakistan to India and vice-versa. Majority of the Hindu families in Pakistan marry off their daughters to India. Likewise, marriages of people from India are solemnized in Pakistan as well. It is to be mentioned that there was initially a huge decline in passengers going to Pakistan by the Thar Express. Only 256 passengers went to Pakistan on Friday, of which 176 are Hindus residing in Pakistan. Till Friday morning, only 45 passengers had booked their tickets. However, after Pakistan released wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman on Friday night, and the number of passengers going to Pakistan increased. Mahendra Singh Rathore is a resident of Khejad ka paar. His barat was to go to Sanau village in Pakistan, but at the last moment, Mahendra, looking to tensions between the two nations, postponed the marriage. They cancelled their programme of going to Pakistan by the Thar Express from Jodhpur and the preparations of the marriage came to a standstill. His relatives and family were disappointed. Mahendra was to marry the daughter of one Ran Singh Sodha at Sanau village in Pakistan on March 8 and the baraat was to leave on Friday by the Thar Express from Jodhpur. All baraatis (groom’s family) had obtained a visa as well. Mahendra plans to get married once peace is restored between the two countries. As per sources, for the first time, a baraat from Pakistan came to India by the Thar Express, in 2014. Karni Singh, son of Hameer Singh Sodha, resident of Amarkot in Pakistan, married Thakur Man Singh’s daughter in Jaipur in 2014. After the Thar Express began services, Hindu families from Pakistan come to Barmer and Jaisalmer to get their daughters married. As a result, more than over 60,000 Pak displaced Hindus are residing in the district. Every year, many Hindu families come here by the Thar Express to get their daughters married and after staying here for a few days, they return to Pakistan.

UK stands shoulder-to-shoulder with India in outrage over Pulwama attack: Boris Johnson - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Britain stands shoulder-to-shoulder with India in outrage over the Pulwama terror attack, and in determination to work towards defeating terrorism that threatens both the countries, British MP and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said Saturday. Speaking at an event in New Delhi, Johnson said India and the United Kingdom would succeed in defeating terrorism, a common threat, for their values were superior to those of terrorists and their sponsors. ""I'm sure I speak for millions of people in my own country when I say we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with India in outrage at the killings in Pulwama, and in our determination to work with you to defeat the terrorist foe that threatens us both,"" Boris Johnson, a former mayor of London, said. ""And we will succeed, and we will defeat them because in the end, it is our values that are superior to those of the terrorists, and those who sponsor them,"" he said. Forty CRPF personnel were killed on February 14 in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district when a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a bus carrying the security forces. On the return of IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman from Pakistan's custody, Johnson said Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has behaved sensibly in deciding to release the pilot but he clearly faces a very difficult situation in dealing with terrorism. ""Imran Khan behaved sensibly in deciding to release the pilot but he clearly faces a very difficult situation and I think all of us who worry about what is going on there has a real real duty to support the civilian side of the government in Pakistan against the deep state elements,"" he said. ""We have a very important relationship with Pakistan but there is no doubt that the deep state in the country has been responsible chronically for association with sponsorship of terrorist groups. We have been trying to address it through task force, blacklisting and grey listing and we put a huge amount of pressure on Pakistan. But we can consider putting more pressure through our aid budget,"" he said. Varthaman was handed over to India by Pakistan after being in captivity for nearly three days. He was captured on February 27 by Pakistan following a dogfight between the two air forces in which his MIG-21 was shot down. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
Pulwama encounter: AMU’s Kashmiri student writes to VC that tweet inspired from movie | Agra News - Times of India,"AGRA: Suspended Kashmiri student of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Basim Hilal, who was booked by the district police for hailing the Pulwama attack, has written to the vice chancellor saying that his tweet was inspired by the movie “Uri”. In a tweet, Hilal, who is pursuing BSc in mathematics, wrote, “How’s the Jaish? Great Sir” and used the hashtags ‘Kashmir’ and ‘Pulwama’. Hilal claimed that he was referring to a dialogue from the recent Bollywood film Uri, which is based on the Army’s 2016 surgical strikes in Pakistan. According to university’s proctor, Mohsin Khan, Hilal’s reply has been forwarded to the committee formed by the university to investigate the matter. He said, a delegation of Kashmiri students also submitted an application pleading the authorities to revoke his suspension. He said, the matter is being investigated and action will be taken on the basis of report submitted by the committee. Hilal, who hails from Beerwah town of J&K, posted a tweet on Feb 14 soon after a Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber blew up a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) bus in Jammu and Kashmir, killing 40 personnel. The attack in Pulwama district attracted widespread condemnation from across the world. The varsity immediately suspended Hilal for committing acts of “indiscipline and misconduct” and also barred his entry to the campus. The varsity officials stated that the varsity has zero tolerance towards such acts. Hilal was booked under IPC’s section 153A (promoting enmity between two different religions) and also section 67 (for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act on the basis of a complaint filed by police media cell incharge, Govind Ballabh Sharma. In September 2016, a Kashmiri student, Mudassar Yusuf, was expelled from the university for posting “objectionable” comments on Facebook after a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri.

 Islamic countries backing India in fight against terror: Rajnath Singh | India News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: India is getting ""abundant"" support of Islamic countries in the fight against terror, Union home minister Rajnath Singh said here on Friday. The government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has decided with pertinacity that the time has come to wage a decisive battle against terrorism in the wake of the Pulwama attack, he said. ""I am very happy to tell you that we are getting abundant support from the Islamic countries of the world,"" he said. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has, for the first time, invited India's foreign minister as a guest of honour in its ongoing meeting, Singh noted. It is a pleasing thing that all nations of the world are coming onto one platform on the question of terrorism, he said. All feel that a decisive battle should be fought against terrorism, he said. Terrorism has no caste, creed or religion but sometimes, there would be some who try to associate it with some religion which is not appropriate, he added. The Home Minister was speaking after inaugurating two new office-cum-housing complexes of the NIA here and Guwahati, built by NBCC India at a cost of about Rs 77 crore. Appreciating NIA for its effective functioning, the Union minister said the conviction rate of NIA is 92 per cent. ""It means, the conviction rate (of NIA) is 92 per cent. It's a matter of pride for all us,"" he said. Noting that the government has given approval to open a research cell on terror-group Islamic State (ISIS), he said, ""We have also given approval to the NIA to set up a research cell on the ISIS."" The minister also said about 100 new posts have been approved in the NIA for effective investigation and supervision. ""Terror funding is a big factor in promoting terrorism. The way NIA performed its role, the result is that there has been a decline in terror funding compared to earlier,"" Singh said. The circulation of fake Indian currency notes has also declined due to the combined efforts of the NIA and other Central and State agencies, he claimed. NIA, he said, has achieved good success in establishing coordination with other agencies like State police and anti-terror squads of different States. The Hyderabad NIA complex is an ""all-inclusive"" project and spread over 12,572 square metre. It has been constructed at a cost of about Rs 37 crore and consists of both administrative and residential flats for its staff. The Guwahati project entailed a cost of Rs 40 crore and has a built-up area of 9,830 square metre. Besides various office buildings and residential quarters, it also has barracks for jawans, and a community centre, according to NBCC India. Singh also said: ""On this occasion, you have feted ('abhinandan kiya hai') me, the Governor, the Home Minister of Telangana. But the truth is, your, our and the whole country's Abhinandan (IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman) is going to enter India in another few hours and come amongst us"".

"China welcomes release of IAF pilot; calls for more cooperation on terrorism between India, Pakistan - Times of India","BEIJING: China on Friday welcomed Pakistan's decision to release the Indian Air Force pilot and encouraged the two countries to engage in more counter terrorism cooperation and dialogue for the regional peace and stability. Pakistan is set to release captured Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman as a ""first step"" to open negotiations with India. Pakistan detained the pilot following a fierce engagement between air forces of the two sides along the Line of Control when his MiG 21 fighter jet was downed. Asked how China views Pakistan's decision to release the pilot and whether Beijing played any behind-the-scenes role in it, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters: ""Well, from the start China has been calling upon the two sides exercise restraint and take measures to ease tensions, engage in dialogue to resolve the differences"". ""I have taken note of the developments. China welcomes the goodwill signals released by the Pakistani side. De-escalation serves the common interests of both the countries. We encourage the two sides to engage in more dialogue for the peace and stability in the region,"" he said. About Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan's offer to investigate the Pulwama terror attack if credible evidence is provided, Lu said: ""we encourage the two sides to take more measures to create favourable atmosphere for the joint efforts to deal with the relevant issue. ""The cooperation on counter-terrorism and jointly uphold the regional peace and stability, this is what China hopes to see"". China's call for more India-Pakistan cooperation on the counter-terrorism comes in the backdrop of Beijing endorsing India's demand for elimination of breeding grounds of terrorism and extremism and agreeing to have joint policy coordination under the aegis of Russia, India, China (RIC) foreign ministers mechanism. Briefing the media after the RIC ministers talks held on February 27 at the Chinese city of Wuzhen, Wang said: ""we agreed to jointly combat all forms of terrorism through closer policy coordination and practical cooperation. Especially important is to eradicate the breeding grounds of terrorism and extremism"". External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, who attended the meeting, held talks with Wang before the RIC meeting. Wang, in his concluding remarks, tried to strike a balance by backing Pakistan, saying ""we believe that Pakistan has always been opposed to terrorism"". But at the same time, he said China would play a constructive role to de-escalate the tense stand-off between India and Pakistan after the Pulwama attack carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). China, however, is yet to disclose the stand it would take in the UN Security Council when the US, the UK and France resolution to list JeM chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist comes up for discussion. China has blocked previous three attempts by India and the three countries on the same issue. On Thursday, it sounded no-committal about the US, the UK and France resolution to list Azhar as a global terrorist. ""As we have said on many occasions, the 1267 committee of the UN Security Council has clear norms on the listing of terrorist organisations or individuals and relevant procedures,"" Lu said in response to a question on the issue. China will continue to take a responsible attitude and participate in the discussions of the Security Council's relevant sanctions committees and other subsidiary bodies, he added.

Pakistan news: India shares with Pakistan dossier on Jaish involvement in Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In a detailed dossier handed over to Pakistan on Wednesday, India has provided comprehensive evidence of Jaish-e-Mohammad’s involvement in the February 14 Pulwama suicide bombing and how it was planned from Pakistani soil. According to sources, apart from the specifics related to Jaish’s training, funding and recruitment activities inside Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir, the audio and video recordings of Maulana Masood Azhar praising the Pulwama attack, details of its planning and names of JeM cadres and commanders involved in it have also been shared with Pakistan. Sources said other important evidence on Pulwama attack and which is part of the dossier include transcripts and telephonic interceptions of Jaish commander Kamran who was later killed in an encounter with the security forces. The dossier also contains NIA’s preliminary investigation details regarding suicide bomber Aadil Ahmad Dar and Sajjad Bhat who provided the car for bombing; names of their handlers; and the mode of attack which all pointed to JeM leadership in Pakistan. Officials said they expected Pakistan to act against the JeM leaders whose names had been given in the dossier, though considering its history, it is highly unlikely that it would dismantle the facilities of the terror group, which “Pak army considers its best asset”. It is not the first time that India has shared a detailed dossier on Jaish with Pakistan. After the Parliament attack, Uri attack and Pathankot attack, evidence had been shared by India, but the Pakistani establishment failed to take credible action. Citing one such instance, an officer said after Pathankot attack, Pakistan had even sent a Joint Investigation Team (SIT) to New Delhi with a promise that it will assess the evidence collected by NIA and act. It was given complete evidence but even after three years, there is no word from the JIT despite repeated reminders, he said. Sources in intelligence agencies said information about targets, including its location, GPS coordinates and other details are normally shared by Pakistan’s ISI with Jaish. In the Pulwama attack, NIA has so far identified several terrorists who were involved in the planning including Bhat and Mudassir Khan, slain Jaish commanders Kamran and Ghazi Ahmed, and several overground workers (OGWs). It has also established that a Maruti Eeco van was used in the bombing, which was bought 10 days before the attack.

Pakistan defies US as it retaliates against India - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: Pakistan's retaliation against what it sees as Indian aggression, which New Delhi, Washington, and other western capitals see as counter-terror actions, comes with a new development: Islamabad's defiance of its one-time patron Washington and the Trump administration's lack of leverage over Pakistan, in part from cutting off the aid spigot. In a statement that left no doubt where its support lies, the Trump administration on Tuesday described India’s airstrikes on the Balakot terror camp as “counter-terrorism actions,” emphasized Washington’s close security partnership with India and the shared goal of maintaining peace and security in the region, and told Pakistan to de-escalate current tensions by avoiding military response and take meaningful action against terrorist groups operating on its soil. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo who is in Hanoi with President Trump for talks with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, spoke to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and her Pakistani counterpart Shah Mohammed Qureshi to underscore these points. “I expressed to both Ministers that we encourage India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, and avoid escalation at any cost. I also encouraged both Ministers to prioritize direct communication and avoid further military activity,” Pompeo added. From the get-go, secretary Pompeo’s statement nailed Pakistan and its claims that it was a victim of Indian aggression, terming the Indian air strikes “counter-terrorism actions.” The distinction not only sets a precedent for future action by New Delhi should Pakistan not heed the US and global advice to wind up terror camps, it also sets the tone for arguments that will inevitable arise in multilateral forums such as the UN. Several other countries, notably France, have recognized India’s right to self-defence while asking Pakistan to address the issue of terror groups on its soil. Pakistan has also been censured, directly or implicitly, by global organisations such as the UN and FATF for its patronage of terror groups. However, the American statement and global consensus against terrorism did not prevent Pakistan from retaliating to what it saw as Indian aggression with a borderline incursion at the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. The Pakistani media reported that foreign minister Qureshi told Pompeo that Pakistan could not but respond to India’s “provocation,” although Pakistan’s hosting of terror group that claimed the Pulwama attack ignited the spat this time. The US statement, by its very wording, tone, and sequence, acknowledged India’s right to conduct the punitive strikes against terrorist camps that were first recorded by US’ own intelligence in 2004. Although the statement eventually encouraged both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, it put the onus on Islamabad to do so by abjuring military response against India and instead directing meaningful action against terrorist groups. Islamabad ignored the missive. The US statement on the subject came hours after Pakistan’s military spokesman Abdul Ghafoor warned of retaliation at a time and place of its choosing, following up on Prime Minister Imran Khan’s warning that Pakistan will not only consider retaliation but will retaliate against any Indian attack. By the time the US statement came around 8.30am, Pakistani jet had already made their symbolic incursion at the LoC. Throughout the skirmish, Pakistan refused to mention or acknowledge the cause of tensions: It's unceasing hosting and use against India of terrorist groups that have been identified worldwide and proscribed by the United Nations. Pakistan continues to coddle the Jaish-e-Mohammed despite the group taking credit and boasting about the Pulwama suicide bombing that killed 40 CRPF soldiers. In fact, Pakistani extremists and trolls celebrated the deaths on social media. Last week, the Trump administration indicated it supported India’s right to self-defence against such Pakistani terrorist depredations, exercising far less restraint than previous US administrations headed by Presidents Obama and Bush. Indeed, world opinion, except for a few members of the Jammu and Kashmir contact group at the OIC, has solidly lined up behind New Delhi, the outcome of long years of restraint against Pakistan’s use of terrorism. The full text of Pompeo’s statement is as follows Statement by secretary Pompeo Following Indian counter-terrorism actions on February 26, I spoke with Indian Minister of External Affairs Swaraj to emphasize our close security partnership and shared goal of maintaining peace and security in the region. I also spoke to Pakistani Foreign Minister Qureshi to underscore the priority of de-escalating current tensions by avoiding military action, and the urgency of Pakistan taking meaningful action against terrorist groups operating on its soil.

"India Pakistan latest news: Pulwama attack happened due to 'impunity and cover' provided to JeM by Pakistan, Sushma Swaraj tells China | India News - Times of India","WUZHEN (China): The Pulwama terror attack is the direct result of the ""impunity and cover"" provided to the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group by Pakistan, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj said on Wednesday as she forcefully raised the terror strike with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi here. Swaraj's meeting with Wang came a day after India destroyed a major Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror training camp in Pakistan. China, a close ally of Pakistan has repeatedly foiled India's attempts to brand JeM chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN. The JeM, founded by Azhar, has already been in the UN's list of banned terror outfits. In 2009, India had moved a proposal by itself to designate Azhar. This was followed in 2016 when India moved the proposal with the P3 - the United States, the United Kingdom and France in the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee to ban Azhar, also the mastermind of the attack on the air base in Pathankot in January, 2016. In 2017, the P3 nations moved a similar proposal again. However, on all occasions China blocked India's proposal on Azhar. ""I am visiting China at a time when there is grief and anger in India. It is the worst terrorist attack directed against our security forces in Jammu and Kashmir,"" she said in her opening remarks during the meeting held on the sidelines of Russia, India, China foreign ministers' meeting. ""The attack was carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, the Pakistan-based and supported terrorist organisation,"" she said. Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were martyred in a suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14, sparking outrage in the country and international condemnation. Following the incident, India bombed and destroyed JeM's biggest training camp in Balakot in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 80-km from the Line of Control (LoC) early Tuesday, killing a ""very large number"" of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders. Stating that the JeM is banned by the UN and other countries, Swaraj told Wang that ""this terrorist attack is the direct result of the impunity and cover provided to the JeM and its leaders by the Pakistani side"". ""After the Pulwama attack the entire UN has spoken with full voice to condemn it,"" she said. Swaraj, who arrived here early this morning, told Wang that this is their first meeting this year and therefore an opportune time for the two sides to take stock of the bilateral relations and look ahead for cooperation. ""This is our first meeting this year. Therefore, an opportune time for us to take stock of our bilateral relations and look ahead for cooperation. The India-China relationship is an important relationship for both of our countries,"" she said. Referring to the Wuhan summit between Prime Minister, Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Swaraj said ""we have made substantial progress in relations"". ""It is important for both sides to make sure the through and effective implementation of the guidance given by the two leaders,"" she told Wang, adding that both side made efforts and ""we should sustain this"". ""Particularly the decision taken by our leaders to maintain strategic communication between them provided an important foundation for the development of our bilateral relations. This channel of strategic communication between the two of us and between senior officials should always remain open,"" she said. Wang said last year's Wuhan meeting between Modi and Xi led the bilateral ties into a new stage. ""Led by the leaders, all aspects of our bilateral relationship are going well. Both nations and the international community are more optimistic of our bilateral relations. In 2019 we are going keep working on the consensus of the two leaders,"" he said. Meanwhile, China on Wednesday again called on India and Pakistan to exercise restraint amid the escalation of hostilities between the two countries and urged them to engage in dialogue to uphold peace and stability in the region. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang's remarks came after Pakistan targeted military installations in India in response to Indian counter-terrorism strikes in Balakot. ""I understand that in the latest development Pakistan says it had shot down two Indian aircraft and captured Indian pilots,"" Lu told the media in Beijing. He said the international community is following the developments closely. Earlier, external affairs minister Swaraj kicked off her key meeting with her Chinese counterpart Wang in a lighter vein, accusing him of cheating her by changing the venue of the RIC meeting to a more beautiful location here. ""You cheated me,"" Swaraj said in her opening statement at their bilateral meeting here. Wang and other Chinese officials broke into laughter hearing her remarks. Swaraj said Wang first told her that the RIC ministers meeting would be held in Shanghai and later sifted it to Wuzhen, the historic city famous for ancient stone bridges, stone pathways and delicate wood carvings. ""Thank you"" for the change of location and it is a very beautiful city, she said and expressed desire to go round the place before her departure.

 NIA raids two JeM terrorists involved in Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency on Wednesday conducted raids at the residences of two Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists from South Kashmir – Mudassir Ahmad Khan and Sajjad Bhat — who played a key role in the February 14 Pulwama car borne suicide bombing in which 40 CRPF jawans were martyred. Mudassir Khan, sources say, is a senior Jaish member who was working closely with Kamran and Ghazi Ahmed to plan and execute the deadly suicide bombing. TOI had first reported on February 20 about Mudassir being part of Pulwama conspiracy and that security forces are looking for him. Sajjad Bhat, a resident of Brijbehara in Anantnag, has already been identified by NIA as the one who bought the Maruti Eeco van, used in the bombing, 10 days before the attack. The car was identified using its Chassis number and engine number with the help of Maruti Suzuki experts. It was sold to one Jaleel Haqqani in 2011 and had been resold seven times before final purchase by Bhat. The NIA teams, on Wednesday, also conducted raid at the houses of active OGWs (Over Ground Workers) of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Tral, Awantipora and Pulwama areas of South Kashmir during which incriminating materials including diaries containing coded writings were seized. Apart from the JeM terrorists and OGWs, the searches were also conducted at the premises of three separatist leaders of South Kashmir - Mohammad Shaban Dar, Shawkat Maulvi and Yasmine Raza, in the J&K terror funding case. Officials said they have recovered documents related to terror funding, coded messages and Jihadi literature, property details, documents relating to financial and monetary transactions, electronic devices, mobile phones, sim cards etc from the separatists.

Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in a suicide attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14, sparking outrage in the country. Following the incident, India on Tuesday bombed and destroyed JeM's biggest training camp in Balakot in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 80-km from the Line of Control (LoC) early Tuesday, killing a ""very large number"" of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders. The joint session of Parliament has been called today (Wednesday) to discuss the tension with India and formulate a national response. The parliamentary leaders will also be given an in-camera briefing by the government on the situation after India's strikes. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi alleged the Indian government is issuing threatening statements in the aftermath of Pulwama incident on the pretext of terrorism just to divert the world opinion from rights violations in Kashmir.

 Key terror training facility decimated at Balakot after Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The air strikes that decimated Jaish’s key terror training facility at Balakot early on Tuesday came at the back of a multi-level crackdown initiated in J&K by different agencies since 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in a car bomb attack on February 14. Unlike the 2016 surgical strike on launch pads in PoK which were a pinpointed response to the attack that killed 19 Army personnel at its Uri camp, the response to the Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy did not stop at hitting the perpetrator’s assets in Pakistan. The counter-action over the past 12 days has seen an operation against top Jaish leaders based in Pulwama, a diplomatic offensive against Pakistan, a crackdown on sympathisers and supporters of Pakistan-based terror organisations in the Hurriyat, rounding up of overground workers and arrest of several Jamaat leaders in the Valley. The first visible step initiated by the J&K government was to withdraw all facilities including security extended to top Hurriyat leaders like Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Moulvi Abbas Ansari, Bilal Lone and Shabir Shah and later several others. On Tuesday, NIA conducted raids on residence/offices of top Hurriyat/separatist leaders — Mirwaiz, Yasin Malik, Shabir Shah, Mohammad Ashraf Khan, Masarat Alam, Zaffar Akbar Bhat and Naseem Gilani — as part of its investigation into the J&K terror funding case. Along with tightening the screws on Hurriyat leaders often seen siding with Pakistan, the security forces in J&K ensured that top Jaish leadership suspected to have ‘handled’ the Pulwama attacker were cornered and killed in an encounter within days of the strike. NIA meanwhile took over probe into the Pulwama case and by February 25 had worked out details of the vehicle used by the car bomber including its last owner who has since joined Jaish and is one of the suspects in the conspiracy. Just a few days earlier, J&K government arrested over 150 Jamaat and middle and low-level Hurriyat leaders. Suspected to be overground workers, the arrests were affected ahead of expected announcement of Lok Sabha polls. A similar round of arrests was affected just prior to the local body polls in J&K which were then conducted peacefully. To ensure that there are no law and order disturbances in the midst of the multi-level crackdown timed close to elections, the home ministry last week rushed 10,000 central para-military personnel to J&K. Home ministry sources said it was a pre-election induction exercise. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Air strike adds to PM Modi’s muscular image, gives BJP big advantage ahead of polls | India News - Times of India","GAURHAT (GHAZIPUR): Hours after news flashed on air strikes on Pakistan territory, BJP chief Amit Shah on Tuesday “celebrated Diwali” with people of this recently electrified village on the banks of Gomti river in UP’s Ghazipur district. Shah said since the Pulwama attack, sentiments were growing among the people that retaliation should be so strong that terrorists will think many times before another attack. “Our forces have destroyed the breeding ground of terror outfits,” he said as the venue echoed with chants of ‘Modi-Modi’. The strikes came at an appropriate time for BJP when Congress and other opposition parties had begun to question the Modi government’s resolve to tackle terrorism in the wake of the Pulwama attack. After having made the government’s response to terrorism a major talking point by comparing UPA’s record and having sought political capital from the 2016 surgical strikes, BJP needed a muscular reaction to the suicide attack at Pulwama. Despite Pakistan’s denials, the fact that IAF jets crossed the Line of Control and fired missiles at the Jaish terror camp at Balakot gave BJP the boost it sought. The prospects of some form of retaliation from Pakistan cannot be ruled out, which could put fresh pressure on the ruling party, but the success in crossing the LoC and the safe return of pilots was a cause for celebration. The party will also use the operation to hit back at Congress’s attempts to run down the PM’s response to Pulwama by saying he was at a photo-shoot and stopped for “chai-samosa” while travelling from Corbett tiger reserve to Bareilly. Shah reached Gaurhat village in Saidpur block of Ghazipur district to launch “Kamal Jyoti Sankalp Abhiyan” which was marked by BJP leaders lighting lamps simultaneously across the country along with beneficiaries of central schemes. Recalling valour of Vir Abdul Hamid, 1971 war hero from adjoining Dhamupur village, Shah said, “The whole nation is celebrating the success of our brave soldiers. The action taken by our forces have given relief to the families, who lost their near and ones in Pulwama and other terror attacks.” “Along with soldiers, I salute the political leadership of the country under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has shown zero tolerance towards terrorism,” Shah said.

Akhilesh was in Mainpuri to meet the kin of a CRPF jawan martyred in the Pulwama terrorist attack. “Terrorists must have now realised that India can’t remain silent and will strike back when it is required and that is what the air force did today morning,” Akhilesh said. Akhilesh said that air force pilots sent a clear signal to Pakistan that they can’t get away with acts like Pulwama that claimed lives of 40 CRPF personnel. Akhilesh said that the government should form a proper strategy to crush terrorism. There is a need to know that how these arms and ammunitions are being supplied to terrorists and who are providing them training and financial assistance. Akhilesh said that it was unfortunate that even after having intelligence inputs, the government did not act on time to prevent the dastardly attack. “They should have acted immediately, not after killing of our jawans by terrorists,” Akhilesh said, adding that continuous exercise is required to tackle this menace. “I salute the Indian Air Force and indeed all our Armed Forces.

Our Air Force killed at least 400 terrorists against the 40 lives we had lost in the attack,” he said, adding they came to know about the attack through news channels. ""The government must ensure that Pakistan does not dare to launch any attack via terrorists or play any mischief against our country and the terrorism stops permanently. They should be made to pay like Tuesday’s retaliation everytime,” he said. Ashok said that the last rites of his nephew would conclude on Wednesday.

"Central Reserve Police Force:   Working to boost intel, morale among troops is very high: CRPF chief | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The director general of country’s largest paramilitary force - Central Reserve Police Force, Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar, in an exclusive interview with TOI on Monday, said that following the Pulwama suicide bombing in which 40 personnel were killed on February 14, the force has decided to enhance its IED detection and intelligence capabilities. Asking civilians in the valley to support CRPF in its cause, the 1983 batch IPS officer asserted that their fight is with the terrorists, not with the people. Excerpts of the interview: Q: After Pulwama attack, what are you doing to make sure the troops are secure? Bhatnagar: A lot has already happened in last few years like we have enhanced the security of our camps, government has provided us with adequate number of bullet-proof jackets, vehicles, weapons and technical equipment but since IEDs have become a problem, we are increasing our capabilities in that area. From now on, every CRPF battalion in J&K will have a BDDS (bomb detection and disposal squad). The ministry of home affairs has already approved this and around 250 men are being trained in IED detection capabilities. The J&K police officers are also being trained at our IED institute at Pune. Subsequently, we will get mine protected vehicles (MPVs) in J&K as well. Q: What about the convoy movements? How do you plan to avoid another Pulwama type attack without causing inconvenience to the civilian traffic? Bhatnagar: We are working on this with all the stakeholders including J&K police, army and intelligence agencies. Certain drills are being developed for this kind of threat – vehicle borne IED (VBIED) attack. The convoys will move in a way that civilian traffic is least disturbed. In fact, several convoys have moved on Jammu-Srinagar highway in last 10 days without any hassle. One way could be to divert the local traffic to the old highway while we move on the new one. Q: You ordered a court of enquiry (CoI) after Pulwama attack to see if there were any lapses on CRPF’s part during the convoy movement. What is the outcome of enquiry?B: Everything was perfectly laid out. There was no deviation from the standard operating procedure (SoP). Nonetheless, we are working on new SoP with other agencies. If you look at the attacks since January 1, 2018, there have been 9 low intensity IED attacks in Kashmir, while convoys of security forces were attacked at least 10 times since 2014. There has never been a significant damage in those attacks. Subsequently, we were cautious of IED attacks and every step was taken but February 14 was completely different IED attack and modus operandi. Q: Was there not enough intelligence inputs? You also have an intelligence unit in Kashmir. What are you doing so that there is no need to depend on other agencies’ input?B: The J&K police and central intelligence agencies always alert us in time. They have a very good network and we constantly work together. However, we are working on strengthening our intelligence capabilities as well. Q: The Lok Sabha elections and the Amarnath Yatra are coming up? What kind of arrangements are in place in Kashmir for it? B: We are fully prepared for providing security for the elections and the Yatra. CRPF is a fighting force and morale among troops is very high. The terrorists won’t be allowed to disturb the peace. Q: What are you doing for the families of martyrs? B: We are developing a centralized system through an app, where our headquarters can directly and constantly help the families with advice the kin of martyrs related to education, finances, help in getting any government work done, admission of kids and even finding a job. For example, the wife of Commandant Pramod Kumar, who died fighting terrorists in Kashmir in 2016, has been given a job of lecturer in Jharkhand through CRPF’s efforts.

"Indications are BJP will take advantage of Pulwama attack, says Zoya Hasan | Chandigarh News - Times of India","CHANDIGARH: JNU professor Zoya Hasan on Monday said electoral success that the BJP witnessed in 2014 is unlikely for the party again, but after the Pulwama attack, the government's response might affect the final outcome. With Opposition clearly cornering the BJP on jobs and agrarian issues, the party's stand on the terror attack might shift public opinion, she said. Hasan was at Panjab University (PU) to deliver a keynote address on 'electoral strategies of political parties in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections'. ""Indications are that they (BJP) will take advantage and they know how to take advantage. It also depends on what they are going to do in the next few days. I don't think this was spontaneous rage. Frankly, a lot of it is manufactured rage. We are not born with opinions and young people are not necessarily born with opinion. They are influenced by different political forces. So, in this case, the BJP has built up an opinion. We have to wait and see now,"" said Prof Hasan while talking to TOI. Drawing parallels, Prof Hasan said the BJP is not an ordinary right-wing party but it is, in essence, a right-wing front of the extreme right represented by the RSS modelled on the European fascist organizations. She added that the objective of the party is not merely to win elections and form governments, but to transform Indian society in all domains of culture, religion and civilization- a project it has assiduously pursued. As we head into the general elections in April May 2019, Prof Hasan said, it is clear that this will be no ordinary electoral contest between the BJP and the Opposition because what is at stake is the future of our democratic republic. It is already clear that BJP, RSS and its allied organisations are embarking on a strategic course, that is far more belligerent and dangerous than in 2014, she added. Moreover, she said, under PM Narendra Modi, the BJP-led NDA government has taken decisive steps on fulfilling several of its core Hindu nationalist commitments. ""Its policy position on citizenship articulated in the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which has not been withdrawn despite huge protest in the North-East, its position on the status of Jammu and Kashmir and its trident public campaign against intellectuals and civil society activists, branding them as urban naxals are all signpost of a new political discourse that is sought to be ingrained in the public space. Now the 2014 elections clearly laid the ground for this. It laid the ground for electoral ascendance of the BJP and a major shift to the right as Modi led his party to a sensational win,"" added Prof Hasan. The professor also thinks that the BJP's gains in recent years have largely come at the expense of the Congress. ""The once dominant party is without a strong base anywhere. Today, the Congress on the other hand rules just in seven states which is its smallest tally in its history,"" she added. She also said for them (BJP) the idea of freeing India of Congress represents more than the removal of the party from the power and means replacing pluralist democracy with a majoritarian democracy.

" Pulwama attack: Since its 1st purchase, terror car was resold seven times | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR/ NEW DELHI: Taking help from forensic experts and Maruti engineers, investigators pieced together remnants of the Eeco car used in the Pulwama attack from the blast site in Lethpura, and zeroed in on Sajjad Bhat, the Jaish member who had bought the vehicle 10 days before the strike. After ascertaining that it was a Maruti Eeco car, they used its chassis number MA3ERLF1SOO183735 and engine number G12BN164140 to trace its original owner. While a photograph circulating on social media introduces Bhat as a resident of Marhama Sangam in Islamabad, the NIA confirmed that he was a resident of Bijbehara in Anantnag district. Bhat’s father, Mohammad Maqbool Bhat, is in his fifties and was arrested for engineering violence in the wake of terrorist Burhan Wani’s killing. He has been questioned by the investigators for leads on his son’s associates and others in his circle of friends.

Kashmir news: ‘We were in touch with Pulwama attack mastermind’ | India News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: The two   Kashmiri youths arrested   by the UP Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) from Deoband township in Saharanpur on Sunday confessed to their links with banned terror outfit Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) and were possibly planning a terror strike. The two also admitted to have been in touch with Pulwama attack mastermind Abdul Rasheed Ghazi who was killed in an encounter with the security forces five days after the CRPF convoy was attacked on February 14. Investigators also claim to have obtained voice messages from the cellphone of one of the two youths—Shahnawaz Teli of Kulgam and Abdul Aqib Mallick of Pulwama—in which he is heard talking about some “ bada kaam” (something big) and “ samaan” (goods). Investigators said the conversation apparently relates to a major operation that the two were planning and “ samaan” was used for weapons or explosives. The two accused reportedly confessed to their links with the JeM during   their interrogation   by director general of police (DGP) OP Singh, who spent four hours questioning them for a first-hand assessment of their involvement in terror activities. Thereafter, the UP Police chief exchanged information with his Jammu & Kashmir counterpart Dilbagh Singh. “They have confessed to their links with JeM in front of me and have given some specific information based on which we are hopeful of some more recoveries in the near future,” DGP Singh told TOI. “During interrogation, Shahnawaz said he had been in touch with terror outfits for 18 months while Aqib came into the scene six months ago,” said inspector general of police, ATS, Asim Arun. He said Shahnawaz has also admitted to have been in touch with Ghazi, who was killed on February 19. The duo also said they were contacted by some top commanders of JeM and joined the group on their insistence. “Some chats retrieved from the mobile phones of the two have voice messages saying ‘kuch karna hai jaldi’ (have to do something soon). They also mention names of some places where weapons were possibly to be taken. But it is yet to be established,” said the IG. The two used to exchange messages through BBM and also used virtual numbers for talking to conceal the identity of those communicating. They will be taken to Kashmir where it is suspected they have hidden dummy grenades to train recruits. Shahnawaz has completed BA first year and a computer course, while Aqib has passed class XII. Shahnawaz’s father is a carpenter and elder brother a teacher. Aqib’s father is a farmer. The ATS will also interrogate other students who had stayed with the two.

"India Pakistan:  Pulwama Attack: Indo-Pak ties pushed to a new low, says Chinese media | India News - Times of India","(This story originally appeared in  on Feb 25, 2019)(This article was originally published by The Economic Times on 25/02/2019) NEW DELHI: The Pulwama terrorist attack was carried out by ‘Mohammad Army’ (as Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad is referred to in Chinese language) and it pushed lukewarm India-Pakistan ties to a new low, creating tensions in South Asia after the Wuhan Summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping had helped stabilise the situation, said a state-run daily that reflects the views of the government in Beijing. “In response to this attack India wants to expand its influence. The Indian government said it had irrefutable evidence that Pakistan was involved in the attack. This can be serious. It accuses a country of participating in such an attack,” said a translated version of a report published last week in the Chinese daily Sina International. The report claimed that the forthcoming general election in India had forced the Modi government to adopt a tough stance on the attack. “Modi is trying every way to get re-elected. In this case, he is likely to choose a radical approach,” it said. Any action by Pakistan against ‘Mohammad Army’ will be very difficult in the absence of mutual trust between India and Pakistan, the report said. “However, Western countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Australia all stood by the Indian side. Obviously, the West wants to pick up the India-Pakistan conflict and create something around China. In response to this situation, if India makes a big fuss and launch a large-scale military operation in Kashmir, then the military conflict between India and Pakistan will reach its peak. How the situation evolves depends on the attitude of India and the political goals the Modi government wants to achieve,” it said. The attack will not have much impact on India-China relations and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor if the situation subsides after the initial tensions, said the report. “China will continue to pay attention to the tension in South Asia caused by this attack. China hopes that India can make wise choices,” it said. A recent article in the Chinese version of the state-run Global Times (which reflects views of the Chinese government) claimed that the Western media had taken the opportunity to provoke China-India relations to shift the focus from the attack itself to China. “The United Nations has a strict set of procedures for listing terrorist organisations and individuals. India’s requirements can be understood, but India cannot be arbitrary,” the article said. “In fact, the ‘East Turkistan Islamic Movement’ (ETIM) in China’s Xinjiang has also been listed on the UN 1267 Committee’s list of terrorist groups. China has also asked for some specific people to be listed but it cannot happen according to one’s own wishes,” said an English translation of the article. The article alleged that the India media was playing into the hands of the US and creating tensions between India and China in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack even as the Indian government maintained strategic autonomy in its foreign policy.

" Pulwama attack: Our bus was 3rd, we wept but were enraged too, says CRPF women | India News - Times of India","BEMINA/PULWAMA/SRINAGAR: With tears tightly held back, Shalu cuts a grim and outrage figure at one of CRPF’s Bemina batallions in Srinagar even as her family is making arrangements for her wedding in Rajouri on March 9 this year. The 28-year-old was among the 30-odd women constables who were part of the February 14 convoy in Pulwama. Their vehicle was third behind the bus that was blown up by Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar, killing 40 CRPF jawans. “Jab bus ko udte hue dekha toh ekdam ghabra gaye, ekdam se khoon khaula aur kaha ki ab yeh saamne aajaye toh usko maar daalenge (When we saw the bus blowing up, I felt like blowing up the terrorist),” she says, adjusting her olive green woolen cap. “I was speaking to my would-be mother-in-law on the phone when the blast took place. She understood, since my fiancé is serving the Indian Army in Gujarat. Our foremost duty will always be to serve the nation,” she insists, recollecting how she had jumped in joy in 2012 when she landed a CRPF job. While stroking the Indian tricolour pin on her jacket, Pushpa, a 38-year-old constable, regrets that she did not have the weapon when the bomber exploded the bus. “I wish I had my weapon and could snuff out his life before he touched my colleagues,” says Pushpa who was returning from a four-day leave on the tragic day. There are four companies of CRPF women serving in the Jammu and Kashmir region at the moment, which have been borrowed from as many battalions. Between them, they guard the Shankaracharya shrine, Central Jail, international airport, high court and government offices in Srinagar. A lot has changed since 1986-87 when the CRPF women battalion was raised for the first time and six women officials were recruited, who were subsequently sent to Sri Lanka. Two DIG-rank women — Nitu Bhattacharya and Annie Abraham - serve here. The challenges in Kashmir include showing resilience when youth pelt stones at their vehicles or keeping a hawk’s eye on protest rallies. “It requires grit to check women in jails and then find SIM cards or cash inside fruits or their pherans at times amid hostilities or face their abuses. It is emotionally draining when you have a six-year-old daughter,” says Divya, an inspector who came under sports quota from Kerala in 2001. Each of them turns emotional as they share their bonhomie - from pipping each other in a badminton game, or teaching them how to lift a bukhari (kerosene-run heater) or shift from INSAS 5.56 mm, 9 mm carbine to AK-47 during night operations. “Sometimes, it’s a group dance, other times it’s a group selfie over birthday cakes,” laughs Draupadi, 51, who has spent 29 years in CRPF with six postings in Kashmir. And, there are always comical arguments over the amount of sugar, milk, honey and nuts in the line barracks, mess, leading to hugs and peace at Sunday bhajans at 9 am. For those among the studious variety, there are always sessions to offer their valuable suggestions on arming themselves with post-graduate degrees.

Khan's remarks came a day after Modi in a rally in Rajasthan said, ""There is consensus in the entire world against terrorism. We are moving ahead with strength to punish the perpetrators of terrorism ... The scores will be settled this time, settled for good ... This is a changed India, this pain will not be tolerated ... We know how to crush terrorism."" Recalling his conversation with Khan during a congratulatory call after he became Pakistan's premier, Modi said he told him ""let us fight against poverty and illiteracy"" and Khan gave his word - saying he is a Pathan's son - but went back on it. Our fight is against terror, not Kashmir or Kashmiris: PM ModiA statement released by the Pakistan Prime Minister's Office said, ""PM Imran Khan stand by his words that if India gives us actionable intelligence, we will immediately act."" PM Modi should ""give peace a chance"", Khan said in the statement. Earlier on February 19 also, Imran Khan assured India that he would act against the perpetrators of the deadly Pulwama terror attack, carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror group, if it shares ""actionable intelligence"" with Islamabad, but warned New Delhi against launching any ""revenge"" retaliatory action. India said Khan's offer to investigate the attack if provided proof is a ""lame excuse"". ""It is a well-known fact that Jaish-e-Mohammad and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan. These should be sufficient proof for Pakistan to take action,"" the ministry of external affairs said. ""The prime minister of Pakistan has offered to investigate the matter if India provides proof. This is a lame excuse. In the horrific attack in Mumbai on 26/11, proof was provided to Pakistan. Despite this, the case has not progressed for the last more than 10 years. Likewise, on the terror attack on Pathankot airbase, there has been no progress. Promises of 'guaranteed action' ring hollow given the track record of Pakistan,"" it said. Imran Khan said during his meeting with PM Modi in December 2015, ""we had agreed that since poverty alleviation is a priority for our region, we would not allow any terrorist incident to derail peace efforts, however, long before Pulwama, these efforts were derailed in September 2018"". The Pakistani premier was referring to India calling off the foreign minister-level talks with Pakistan in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September last year after following the ""brutal"" killing of three BSF jawans by Pakistani soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir as well as the release of postal stamps ""glorifying"" Kashmiri militant Burhan Wani by the Pakistan government.

Security forces tell AIFF to keep football on hold in Srinagar | Goa News - Times of India,"Panaji: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) was forced to postpone a Second Division I-League clash in Srinagar after security forces withdrew an earlier clearance and said it was “too risky” to play football. Lonestar Kashmir FC were scheduled to host ARA FC at the TRC Football Ground in Srinagar on Sunday. The match coordination meeting and preparations for the clash were all going as planned. But a few hours before the clash, organisers were told by security forces that it was too much of a risk to go ahead with match. The organisers didn’t want to take a chance and immediately told the visiting team from Ahmedabad that the match has been postponed. “The teams were in Srinagar. They were at the hotel itself when the message was communicated to them. They didn’t step out. The security situation became slightly problematic in the morning,” said I-League CEO Sunando Dhar. Since Saturday, Jammu and Kashmir police have started to crack down on separatist groups and are reported to have made 150 arrests. After the deadly Pulwama terror attack that left 40 CRPF personnel dead, the presence of paramilitary forces in the state has increased. “There was a call for a shutdown in the valley on Sunday. The restrictions imposed on movement to maintain law and order made it difficult to move, forget about playing football. The situation is tense. When the security agencies withdrew permission, the AIFF was left with no choice,” said another official. The AIFF’s decision to postpone the clash due to security concerns may help Minerva Punjab’s cause after the I-League champions refused to travel to Srinagar due to concerns over their safety last week. The AIFF did not postpone the clash and its league committee will decide on the outcome on Monday. “Unlike the previous game (Real Kashmir vs Minerva Punjab in the I-League), the security agencies did not give us the go ahead today (for the Second Division clash). There was clearance for the first game but not this one,” said Dhar. The committee will also decide if it’s safe for East Bengal to travel to Srinagar later this week for a clash that will have a huge bearing on the title race.

Last year the Kashmiris publishers had participated and this year too some of them were having plans to get a space in the university to sell their books. “Last year some Kashmiri publishers had participated and installed two stalls to sell out their books however this year they did not reach following a sense of fear in their mind as in some parts of the country the feeling of hatred against the Kashmiris was rising, though it was not seen in Punjab. The Kashmiris feel safe in Punjab as the state government also assured them protection while the Sikhs had shown a kind gesture. Some of the Kashmiri publishers were willing to come but after Pulwama attack on soldiers the equations changed and they dropped the plan,"" said Professor Sarbjinder Singh, Publication Bureau head and HOD Guru Granth Sahib studies department. Notably, there are more than 25 Kashmiri students in the university and most of them had not gone back to Kashmir. The students are however, participating in the book-fair to purchase the books of their taste. President Secular Youth Federation of India, a student union in Punjabi University, Harveerjot Singh, said, ""It is disgraceful for both the governments at centre and state level that Kashmiris have been living in a sense of fear in a number of states. Though, there has been no fear in minds of Kashmiri students in our university as we will definitely come to their support whenever they are in need.

"Haldwani: Stores run by former Army jawan, kin offer 10% discount to customers who chant ‘Pakistan Murdabad’ | Dehradun News - Times of India","NAINITAL: Two mom-and-pop stores run by a former Army jawan and his family are offering 10% discount on all items, including electronics, to customers who chant ‘Pakistan Murdabad’. Pramod Joshi, who served in the Army for 15 years, now runs a departmental store in Daheria in the city. Adjacent to the store is another shop where his brother, Girish Joshi, sells electronics. On Saturday, 10 days after the Pulwama attack, both brothers started offering a 10% discount to customers who enter the shop and chant ‘Pakistan Murdabad’. This, the duo say, is their way to encourage people to protest against the neighbouring country harbouring terrorists. “Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammad has carried out a cowardly act by attacking our soldiers in Pulwama. We need to act against the neighbouring country now,” said the brothers while talking to TOI on Sunday. The elder of the two brothers and a former Army jawan, Pramod, said that he had taken part in many anti-terror operations when he was a soldier. “Seeing the blood of our fellow countrymen spilled by terrorists in such a cowardly manner made me angry. We decided to offer discount to those who protest along with us,” said Pramod. Girish added that they were simple people who do not prefer “hate-mongering or war”, but it was now time to give “a befitting reply to Pakistan which was a terrorist haven”. The brothers have also installed a dustbin with the word ‘Pakistan’ written on it outside the shops. “The bin is symbolic of the current status of Pakistan. It is a haven for terrorists and should be treated like garbage.” Residents have been more than happy to avail the offer and raise anti-Pakistan slogans, said the brothers who claim to have provided the discount to over 25 customers in two days. Bhupendra Rawat, one of the customers who availed the offer on packaged milk on Sunday, said, “It’s not about the discount I got. I wanted to protest this heinous act of terror.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

He also mentioned responses of families of deceased CRPF men and said that the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration. Paying tributes to security forces, Modi said he will dedicate the National War Memorial to them on Monday and added that not having such a memorial always pained and surprised him. ""I do believe that for our countrymen a visit to the National War Memorial will be akin to a pilgrimage to a holy place. The National Soldiers' Memorial is a symbol of the nation's gratitude to those men who made the supreme sacrifice after we gained Independence,"" he said. During the address, he paid tributes to tribal warrior Birsa Munda, who was arrested by the British forces on March 3 in 1900, pioneering industrialists Jamsetji Tata, whose birth anniversary falls on March 3, and former prime minister Morarji Desai, who was born on February 29. Describing Desai as one of the most disciplined leaders, Modi noted that the first post-Emergency government headed by Desai had brought about 44th Constitutional Amendment, which restored powers of the Supreme Court and undid many excesses of the Emergency. The amendment restored certain powers of the Supreme Court and declared that the fundamental rights granted under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution could not be abrogated during the Emergency. ""For the first time, constitutional safeguards guaranteed that the President could only announce the Emergency upon the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and that the period of Emergency could not be extended more than six months at any stretch of time. In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was assassinated in 1975 by imposition of Emergency could never be repeated again in the future,"" Modi said. The prime minister also referred to the humble origins of the latest group of Padma awardees. He said many people began enquiring about them after they were given the honour which shows that they worked selflessly on the ground while not making it to media headlines. Modi discussed works of several of these awardees and noted that 12 of them were farmers.

Today, we are heading towards a New India. This year we tend to honour those who are selflessly working at the grass-root level. * The former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was born on February 29. Blessed with a calm and peace loving personality, Morarji bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country. * During the tenure of Morarji Desai, the 44th Constitutional amendment was introduced. This is important because during emergency 42nd amendment was introduced — which aimed at reducing the powers of the Supreme Court. The 44 amendment nullified it. * Jamshedji Tata was a visionary in a true sense who not only saw the future of India but also helped in laying its strong foundations. * If today, our youth needs the guidance of an inspirational figure then he is 'Bhagwaan Birsa Munda'. * After Pulwama terror attack, the people of the country are hurt and angry for the martyred soldiers. * Following the martyrdom of brave soldiers, the inspirational stories of their kin has given courage to the entire country. * We no longer have to look at the past to understand the meaning of patriotism, worship and sacrifice. * I will urge the young generation to understand and be aware of the feelings and determination shown by the family members of these martyrs. * I was both surprised and pained to know that India had no National War Memorial.

 Donald Trump says he understands India's desire for strong response to Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: US president Donald Trump said on Friday that he can understand India is looking for a ""very strong"" response following the Pulwama attacked claimed by Pakistani terrorist group, while characterizing the situation in the subcontinent as ""very dangerous."" Trump also disclosed the US and other nations are involved in the process of defusing the situation, an intervention that was evident in Islamabad where senior American officials have been in discussions with the Pakistani government over actions it can take to address its military's chronic pursuit of terrorism as a policy. It was the third time in a week that Washington has indicated that it is aware of the strong feelings in India following the Pulwama attack while acknowledging New Delhi has the right to self-defense. Earlier in the week, US National Security Advisor John Bolton spoke to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval twice on phone following the attack to offer condolences and express support for an Indian response in “self-defense,” an open ended term that allows New Delhi to fashion its own answer to Pakistani provocation. By characterising any Indian retaliation as self-defense, the Trump administration is effectively calling out Pakistan for the attack. Trump too indicated he empathized with India. ""India is looking at something very strong. India just lost almost 50 people in the attack. I can understand that too,"" he said, adding that his administration was talking to authorities in both countries. ""We're talking. A lot of people are. It's going to be a very, very delicate balance. There is a lot of problems between India and Pakistan because of what just happened."" The international community has also gotten behind New Delhi. On Thursday, the United Nations Security Council on virtually identified India as a victim of terrorism emanating from Pakistan and asked member states to cooperate actively with New Delhi to bring the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack to justice. Although, the statement did not explicitly name Pakistan, it identified the Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed, which bragged about the attack and whose leader remains free and protected by Pakistani state, while directly asking member states to “to cooperate actively with the Government of India and all other relevant authorities in this regard."" The statement also identified the place of the attack as “Jammu and Kashmir,” India’s official term for a state of the union, rather than other appellations used by Pakistan. “The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,"" the statement said, adding that any ""acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.” Pakistan has often rationalized terrorism and acts of violence in Jammu and Kashmir perpetrated by its terrorist groups and accomplices inside India to be fallout of India’s human rights excesses. Just the previous day, Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN Maleeha Lodhi had met Secretary General Antonio Gutterres and argued that the Pulwama incident “reinforces the need to address the root cause of violence in occupied Jammu and Kashmir and to find a peaceful solution to the longstanding dispute in accordance with several UN Security Council resolutions.” The most significant UN resolution 47 relating to Kashmir actually directs Pakistan to withdraw from the portion of Jammu and Kashmir that it has occupied - something Pakistani officials are loath to recall - as the first step in a three-step process. Lodhi also argued that “India's no-talk posture is not only irresponsible, but it puts at stake, the peace and security of all of South Asia,” despite countries of the region, notably India, Afghanistan, and Iran, identifying Pakistan as the source of terrorism endangering peace in the region.

" Our fight is against terror, not Kashmir or Kashmiris: PM Modi | India News - Times of India","TONK (RAJASTHAN): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday deplored incidents of harassment of Kashmiris outside Jammu & Kashmir after the Pulwama terror attack and said India’s fight is not against Kashmir or its residents but terrorism and enemies of humanity. Addressing concerns over Kashmiris, particularly students, being threatened and, in some cases, assaulted, the PM said the issue is not the scale of such incidents but that they had occurred at all. “Incidents were reported and the issue is not what happened and on what scale but that it should not have happened. Children of Kashmir are also suffering because of these terrorists and they are standing in our support to eliminate terrorists and we need their support,” Modi said at a rally. Modi also referred to a conversation he had with Pakistan PM Imran Khan to say the onus of taking action against terrorist organisations lies with Islamabad. He said he had urged Khan that India and Pakistan wage war against poverty and illiteracy and the leader promised that as a Pathan, he believed in truthfulness. “Today is the time to see if he lives by his words or not,” said the PM. Though he said he wants to see if Khan acted on his words, Modi made it clear that he was intent on action. “Is baar sabka hisab hoga (Perpetrators will be held to account),” Modi said. “Peace can’t be restored until these factories of terrorism are shut. If it is the case that I was destined to seal such factories of terrorism, then it will certainly happen.” On the harassment of Kashmiris, he said such actions play into the hands of secessionists. Speaking out against incidents of harassment of Kashmiris in the wake of the Pulwama attack, PM Modi, addressing a rally, said: “The way Indian soldiers have laid down their lives, sons of the Kashmiri soil have also fallen victim to the bullets of terrorists but for a handful who offer blessings to tukde, tukde gangs. No citizen of this country will encourage people who shout slogans like ‘Bharat tere tukde honge, insha Allah’.” The PM reminded the crowd that Kashmiris have welcomed Amarnath pilgrims and had queued up to donate blood when an attack took place on the yatris. “The safety of each Kashmiri settled anywhere in the country is the responsibility of every Indian and I exhort people here to raise their hands and promise to ensure the safety of Kashmiris,” he said. On his interaction with Khan, he said, “I had told him on the phone that India and Pakistan have fought several battles and that Pakistan gained nothing as we won all the battles and this will continue in future too... He had promised that he is a Pathan and believes in truthfulness. Today is the time to see if he lives by his words or not.” The PM said over 200 former panchayat representatives had met him after the panchayat polls in J&K and had urged them to stop incidents of terrorists burning schools. “Today I can proudly say they have resisted terrorists and no incident or school burning has been reported since then.” “I request certain people not to support terrorists even by mistake. People of Kashmir want to be rid of terrorism but their dreams remain unfulfilled due to the policies of previous governments,” he said.

 Pak military planned Pulwama terror attack alleges MQM founder leader Altaf Hussain | India News - Times of India,"LONDON: Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder leader Altaf Hussain has called the Pulwama terror attack a product of the ghoulish Pakistani military establishment. ""As usual, the demons in the military junta, through the Pulwama attack, had conspired against the oppressed nationals in Pakistan, the Pashtuns, Balouchs and Mohajirs. Through that Pulwama terror attack, Pakistan's demonic military wanted to divert the attention of the world from demands of the oppressed nations in Pakistan for the right of self-determination. Through the Pulwama terror attack, the ghoulish Pakistani military establishment is now pushing the people of Pakistan on the path of religious extremism and war mania,"" he asserted. He said, ""Even India failed to apprehend before-time the real objectives of the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 men of India's armed force had embraced martyrdom. The attack was planned by the demonic military of Pakistan and was executed by one of the world's top Pakistan-based terrorist organisations, the Jaish-e Muhammad (JeM)."" In fact, the military establishment of Pakistan has always created a new situation to manipulate the one they had previously created. In recent days, a strong wave of freedom was aroused in minds and hearts of Pashtuns, Balouchs and Mohajirs and it had bewildered the military of Pakistan which planned for a situation to divert attention and hence they executed the Pulwama terror attack, he argued. Hussain said that the people of Pakistan including Pashtuns, Balouchs, Mohajirs and even People of Punjab had started realising that the military was dividing them to rule and hence, they all had started chanting slogans against the military of Pakistan, saying, the military was involved in every single act of terrorism. Even the military chief General Jawed Qamar Bajwa had also been vehemently slammed over nefarious military plans against the people of Pakistan. He further claimed that at a stage, the military corps commanders devised a plan for diverting the attention, so they prepared a terror attack plan in India and successfully executed it in Pulwama. Now, they are extensively talking about war with India and trying to bring the people of Pakistan on one platform that would be in support of the ghoulish military, he said, adding that military is exploiting the people with their religious binding. He said, ""Pakistan is saying that India would attack the country. It is claiming that not only their country but also Islam would also be in jeopardy. By this manipulation, the military is seeking the backing of Pashtuns, Balouchs and Mohajirs against India."" Hussain said that the military of Pakistan has once again re-strengthened the extremist gangs and organisations in Pakistan including Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ), LeJ, Jamat Ud Dawa (JuD), Sipah-e Sahaba among others. He said that the same was done in 1971 when the people of Pakistan were befooled. ""In fact, the demonic military can go to any extent for keeping its tyrant occupation over the country. Islam was never in jeopardy in Bangladesh in 1971. Mosques and shrines are still present and the people there are still Muslim and they go for Hajj pilgrimage more than Pakistanis. It proved the military's propaganda was a fraud,"" he added. The MQM founder leader said that the closure of a seminary (JuD headquarters) in Punjab is a tricky business of the military because the JuD chief Hafiz Saeed was brought on TV through an interview, which was nothing but a cheap tactic to dupe the world. ""If the JuD HQ was not in Pakistan then why the demonic military said they have taken control of that JuD HQ"", he asked. Hussain further told that the military is bringing forward their puppets, which are traitors of Mohajir nation, on the streets to condemn India on the pattern of extremist organisations on the military's payroll. ""For this, the PSP gang of traitors and Bahadurabad gang are being asked by the military to take to the street in India's condemnation,"" he divulged. He asked the PSP and Bahadurabad traitors to tell if India imposed the quota system that deprived Mohajirs of their due legal rights for jobs and admissions in academic institutions. ""Did India carry out a genocide military crackdown against Mohajirs or was it the military of Pakistan? Who, India or Pakistan, filled the graves with bodies of Mohajirs? Who, Indian forces or Pakistani military killed Aftab Ahmed and other 22, 000 Mohajir youth extrajudicially and who, Indian forces or Pakistani military raided the houses of Mohajirs and manhandled Mohajirs women? If India did not do all those atrocities then why the PSP and Bahadurabad gangs of traitors are taking to street against India?"" he questioned. He said that the PSP and Bahadurabad gangs of traitors once used to call themselves secular but today, as they too have become a mere puppet of the demonic Pakistan army, have turned extremists, right-wingers, too. He asked Mohajirs to completely boycott these gangs of traitors known as PSP gang and Bahadurabad gang. He asked the military of Pakistan to accept the demand of Mohajirs for a right of self-determination. He said he would never cease to expose the demonic military of Pakistan.

Rahul Gandhi: Narendra Modi govt doesn't want to accept there is 'job crisis' | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Firing a fresh salvo at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress president Rahul Gandhi Saturday alleged the government ""does not want to accept"" that there was a ""job crisis"" in the country, and said the PM should hold discussions with the youth to address the issue. During an interaction - Shiksha: Dasha Aur Disha - with university students at the JLN Stadium here, he also alleged that the country's wealth is ""concentrated"" in the hands of ""a few people"". The Congress chief asserted that the state must pay for a large part of education of students. Jobless growth, rural indebtedness, urban chaos have made aspirational youths restless: Manmohan SinghThere was no immediate reaction from the government. China is growing economically and one sees 'Made in China' labels on so many products in the country, Gandhi said, adding that he was ""absolutely convinced"" that India could go ahead of China. He reiterated the per hour job figures to attack the prime minister on the issue. ""In a county of over 1.2 billion people India is creating about 450 jobs per 24 hours, while China is creating 50,000 jobs in the same 24 hours,"" he said, claiming that ""these are not my figures, but of the Finance Ministry given in the Lok Sabha"". However, the government ""does not want to accept"" that there is a ""job crisis"" in the country, he alleged. ""Our prime minister doesn't seem to think this is a problem,"" Gandhi said. ""We need to first acknowledge that there is a problem and then we need to galvanise support to fight it. That is what we (Congress) believe in,"" he said. Gandhi said he has already challenged the prime minister to debate with him on Rafale, corruption, job and other issues. ""But has he come and interacted with you (students) like this, taking questions from you,"" the Congress president asked the students. The prime minister should interact with the youth and listen to their views on the job scenario and ""say that he needs your support to address this issue,"" Gandhi said. He said ""the prime minister should not be telling his views to the youth, but listen to their voices"". Responding to another question, Gandhi said the share of the education sector in the budget should be increased. Wealth is ""concentrated"" in the hands of ""a few people"", he alleged and asserted that the state must pay for a ""large part of education"" of students. Attacking the BJP, the Congress chief also alleged there has been a ""steep decline"" in the amount spent on education today by the government, compared to the expenditure when the UPA was in power, Gandhi claimed. ""The BJP (government) is convinced that private industry should be used to support education and that privatisation is the key to education. We don't believe that,"" he said. The Congress does not support that privatisation is the way to improve the education system, the party chief said. Improving education system means making bank loans easier, scholarships, adding number of universities and colleges and pushing school enrolment, he said. ""And, if you see, there has been a fall in every single of these metric, in the BJP regime,"" the Congress chief alleged. Asked about the institutions in the Northeast, he said, ""We are absolutely committed to increase the number of higher education institutions in the Northeast."" Gandhi also hit at the Centre over appointment of vice-chancellors in various universities in the last few years, alleging, ""VCs belonging to an organisation, having a certain ideology, are being appointed in universities one by one."" ""They are not concerned with global vision and feelings of students. They are only concerned with their own ideology and want to use India's education system as a weapon. It is frankly an insult to you (students),"" he said. ""Education system should only be an instrument for the youth, it should not be an instrument for one organisation or one ideology,"" he said. To a question on the JIO University, Gandhi said, ""IIT brand was not built over time and not overnight unlike one institution which has achieved eminence without having a single student."" Gandhi Saturday also said paramilitary personnel who are killed in the line of duty will be accorded with 'martyr' status if his party comes to power. Donning a pair of denim and a jacket over a white tee, he spoke to the students in rather informal manner, speaking both in English and Hindi. ""I have not come here dressed up in my normal uniform (pyjama kurtas), but there is logic to it...I want to understand your issue and what is troubling you. I have come here to listen to you,"" Gandhi said. Delhi Congress chief and former chief minister Sheila Dikshit was also present on the occasion. A two-minute silence was also observed in honour of the 40 CRPF jawans who died in the deadly Pulwama terror attack on February 14 and a musical tribute was given to them.

The Jamaat cadres were picked up from various places, including Anantnag, Pahalgham, Dialgam, Tral all in south Kashmir. Police sources said they were detained because they had inputs of mass protests in view of the Supreme Court hearing on Article 35A tomorrow. Officials privy to the developments said this is the first major crackdown on the organisation that is part of the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, a separatist conglomerate. The Jamaat claimed that during the intervening night of February 22 and February 23, police and other agencies launched a mass arrest drive and raided many houses in the Valley, wherein dozens of its central and district level leaders were arrested.

Pulwama remark: Law student hits teacher | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A guest faculty member at Delhi University’s Law Faculty was allegedly assaulted by a student who claimed that the teacher had made an “insensitive” statement about the death of the CRPF personnel in the Pulwama attack. While the teacher, who prefers to stay anonymous, has filed a police complaint, Devendra Barala, a third-year student, received a showcause notice from Joint Student-Teachers’ Consultative Committee on Friday to explain his behaviour. Ved Kumari, dean of Law Faculty, said the department would constitute a committee to investigate the matter. The teacher told TOI, “I never said anything of the sort. He assaulted me and then dragged me to Maurice Nagar police station. But I managed to file an assault case against him.” However, Barala has claimed in a letter to the dean and the DU vice-chancellor that on the day of the Pulwama attack, he tried to show a video of the incident to the teacher outside the class but he refused claiming it to be a propaganda material. “The professor said why feel sad for those who are there to die,” he alleged, adding that the next day, the teacher had stuck to his point. The teacher claimed he had told the student, who was trying to show him a video on WhatsApp, that “you should not believe in whatever you see on social media as these are often fake or part of propaganda”. On February 20, Barala told TOI, the teacher told him that “I should not be emotional and that the Armymen are dying in northeastern states and Jharkhand as well.” After this, Barala said, he took the teacher to the police station for his “anti-national” comments, but cops filed a case against him. The teacher said it was Barala who came and asked him about his views on the attack. “I told him ‘it is a condemnable incident and there is no justification for terror’. I also told him that ‘we must also criticise the government’. The student didn’t like it and attacked and forced me to the police station.” Read this report in BengaliDownload The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" This isn’t 1-week battle, we need decisive win: Jaitley | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The country is “extremely angry” over the terror attack in Pulwama and the government will use all instruments to tackle a rogue state like Pakistan that has failed to act against terrorists in its territory, finance minister Arun Jaitley said. Speaking at the Economic Times Global Business Summit here on Friday, Jaitley said, “Pakistan is riding a tiger and the tiger never spares its own riders… This is not a one-week battle, it has to be undertaken on various fronts... We have to act in a manner that this battle has to be decisively won by us.” 'Why need proof when terror group has owned up?'Criticising Pakistan PM Imran Khan for demanding proof in the Pulwama attack, finance minister Arun Jaitley, said, “The head of the government says, ‘Give me actionable intelligence’. You need actionable intelligence if it is a blind offence, but here is a man sitting in your own country who owned up to the offence. So when there is a confession... You have people sitting in your own country and admitting to the offence and saying that ‘yes, we have done it’ and taking credit for it.” He added that the battle against terrorism sourced from Pakistan has to be decisively won. Jaitley’s statement comes a week after the Cabinet Committee on Security decided to withdraw the most-favoured-nation state status granted to Pakistan and raised import duties to 200%. In addition, several other steps have been taken, including those at the United Nations, to isolate Pakistan. The finance minister also suggested India had much more financial muscle in any confrontation with Pakistan, which had fared poorly on economic and human development indices. Describing Pakistan as a “rogue state” in the neighbourhood, he said there was no need to provide any evidence when terror groups based there had taken responsibility. Jaitley also slammed political opponents for raising “fake issues”, including the controversy of electronic voting machines, privacy concerns around Aadhaar and alleged loan waiver for 15 large corporate houses. Asked about the charge of the Modi government’s attack on institutions, he said: “It is completely fake issue. With the judiciary the only issue was within the constitutional framework. They refer several names for the appointment of judges and under the constitutional framework, the government can give its opinion in case of certain people some cases can be sent back.

"Situation will ease soon, hope Kashmiri Pandits | Kolkata News - Times of India","KOLKATA: Kashmiri Pandits, who were driven away from their homeland in 1989 and have made Kolkata their home, hope the attacks on ethnic Kashmiris in the city and elsewhere in the country will stop soon. “We were literally forced to give up our homes and leave Kashmir. So, we understand the pain of getting uprooted. What happened to us should not happen to anyone anywhere. As Indian citizens, everyone has the right to live and earn anywhere in the country. That such incidents have happened in Bengal and Kolkata is shocking. This was never the culture here. There have been killings using guns and choppers over political differences. But the common man has not been effected, except for a day or two in 1984 when Sikhs were targeted after Indira Gandhi's assassination,” said Narendra Kaul, secretary of Kashmir Sabha, a forum for the 100-odd Kashmiri Pandit families that currently reside in Kolkata. The abuse and threats to a Kashmiri cardiologist, who has been living in the city for two decades, has touched a few raw nerves. “What is the sense of targeting the doctor? Incidents like these can alienate even those sections of Kashmiris who are Indian at heart,” he reasoned. Some believe the extreme reaction against Kashmiris is due to the unprecedented nature of the attack in which a local boy had become a jehadi for the first time. “It is the government that needs to find a way to deal with the situation. People cannot take law into their hand. Treating every Kashmiri as a potential jehadi is unfair. If we consider Kashmiris Indians, they should be given the same treatment as you and me,” said Sabha treasurer Ratan Mota. The problem, most felt, was the intolerance that had crept into all levels of society. People get easily provoked and offended and react with venom. A Kashmiri, who has managed to escape any unsavory incident till now, said it was owing to him intentionally maintaining a low profile rather than anything else. “We Kashmiris should not discuss about our vulnerability or anything else. We are living on the sword’s edge and it is a double-edged sword. A word or phase could easily get misconstrued. There are mischief mongers waiting to pounce. Keeping mum is the safest bet,” he said. Kashmiri Ifrah Butt, who lived in Kolkata for a short while before shifting base to Bengaluru, said the abuse and attack that Kashmiris elsewhere in India had faced following the Pulwama incident was more deep-seated than it appears. “A question is being asked about how Indian Kashmiris feel. But are Kashmiris accepted as Indians? In 2017, I was working with a human rights organisation in Bengaluru. The day after India lost the Champion’s Trophy final to Pakistan, I felt the creeps when I went to office. I received a very cold reception from my colleagues who seemed to assume that I was a Pakistan supporter,” she recounted. If there is any place that she would want to settle down in, Butt says it is Kolkata. For during her brief stay in the city, she felt as secure as home.

"Jaish-e-Mohammed:  Crackdown or an eyewash? Under global pressure, Pak Punjab takes over Jaish HQ - Times of India","ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: The government of Pakistan’s Punjab province on Friday took control of the Islamic seminaries in Bahawalpur of Maulana Masood Azhar-led   Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM)   , the terrorist organisation that owned up to the suicide bombing of a CRPF convoy that killed   40 jawans in Pulwama on February 14   . The move came a day after Pakistani PM Imran Khan directed the interior ministry and security institutions to accelerate action against extremist outfits in the country, following a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC), Pakistan’s top civil-military body tasked to make crucial decisions on security and foreign affairs. JKLF chief Yasin Malik detained in Jammu and KashmirThe takeover of the complex, however, did not impress Indian observers, with reports that Azhar had left Bahawalpur days ago, and remains in the ‘safekeeping’ of the Pakistan military, which regards him as a valuable “asset” in the proxy war against India. There have been similar crackdowns in the past that did not amount to much, such as after the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai, when some Lashkar-e-Taiba camps were raided. The action seems a hasty response to international pressure and the fresh decision of anti-terror financing body FATF to keep Pakistan on the ‘grey list’. Unless backed by concrete steps against Azhar and terror training camps along the Line of Control, taking over the Jaish campus may not amount to much more than Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed’s sporadic house arrests, which lack any serious intent. The government of Punjab has taken over control of a campus comprising Madressatul Sabir and Jama-e-Masjid Subhanallah in Bahawalpur, reportedly the headquarters of Jaish-e-Mohammed, and appointed an administrator to manage its affairs,” a spokesperson for the interior ministry said. “Punjab police has taken over security of the campus,” the spokesperson added. He said the action was taken in line with the decision of the NSC meeting on Thursday under the chairmanship of PM Khan. According to the spokesperson, 600 students study on the JeM campus, which has a faculty of 70 teachers. The NSC had also decided to ban Jamaat-ud Dawa and Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), militant organisations. A subsequent statement issued by the interior ministry spokesperson explained that the Bahawalpur complex was “purely a madressah and Jamia Masjid (central mosque) where scores of orphans and students from underprivileged families are receiving religious and worldly education”, Dawn, a Pakistani English daily, reported.

 India could block even Pakistan’s share of Indus waters: Nitin Gadkari | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Water resources minister and senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari on Friday stepped up pressure on Pakistan, saying he had asked the ministry to explore options that could block even the neighbour’s share of waters from the Indus system as terrorism and business-as-usual could not go hand in hand. Gadkari’s comments are a scale up of   his comments on Thursday   when he restricted himself to saying India will make use of its share of waters currently flowing into Pakistan. He said while the decision to curtail Pakistan’s share — which can amount to abrogation of the Indus Water Treaty — needs the top leadership’s consideration, his ministry was examining various options. #WATCH Union Min Nitin Gadkari says,""Nirnay kewal mere dept ka nahi hai, sarkar aur PM ke level pe nirnay hoga par… https://t.co/ItCyjMKIIp— ANI (@ANI) 1550811372000“Nirnay kewal mere department ka nahi hai.

It’ll be taken at the level of PM and government, but I told my department to prepare technical designs of projects on where we can stop even Pakistan’s share of water),” Gadkari told ANI. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesHe further said since Pakistan insisted on inflicting terrorism on India, it would be difficult to keep humanitarian considerations in mind. The principles of shared concerns and needs that animated the inking of the treaty after independence have not been reciprocated, the minister added. Speaking at a workers’ meeting in Jabalpur, he said, “If Pakistan does not stop sending terrorists to India, we will not give a single drop of water to them.” The ministry did not elaborate on Gadkari’s remarks. Experts believe India will have to abrogate the 1960 treaty if the government decides on such an option. “If there is political will, India can go ahead with it unilaterally. There are provisions under Vienna Convention where a country can go for unilateral abrogation in such circumstances,” said Uttam Sinha, senior fellow at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. Sinha, however, said the option was not easy as India would need a cost-benefit analysis both in terms of its impact internationally as well as regionally (in terms of its relations with Nepal and Bangladesh). There could be three options — renegotiation of IWT, suspension of the Indus Water Commission indefinitely and developing capacity to fully utilise its own share of water under the treaty. Former water secretary Shashi Shekhar said the option of abrogation should be examined in a larger context. “The IWT survived three wars (1965, 1971 and 1999). India has always been very gracious. The question is whether the country should comply with its obligation under the treaty when Pakistan continues to fan terrorism,” he told TOI. Shekhar said there were precedents when the US and China had abrogated treaties. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Centre asks states to provide security to Kashmiris | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Centre late on Friday night asked all states to ensure security of people belonging to Jammu and Kashmir amid reports that some of them were attacked in different parts of the country in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack. This was conveyed by the home ministry in an advisory to all states following a directive of the Supreme Court, which took up a petition in this regard. The state governments and Union Territory administrations and the nodal officers appointed by them are once again advised to take all necessary steps to prevent any act of assault, threat, intimidation, social boycott etc. against Kashmiris (including students) as well as minorities in accordance with the order of the Supreme Court, the advisory sent to all state government said. The home ministry also said the central government is concerned at the reports of incidents of assaults and harassment against residents of Jammu and Kashmir, especially students in some parts of the country, in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack on February 14, in which 40 CRPF jawans were martyred. In this regard, an advisory was issued on February 16 to all state governments and Union Territory administrations to take necessary steps to ensure safety and security of the persons belonging to Jammu and Kashmir. This issue was also raised before the Supreme Court which directed that the nodal officers appointed by the states/UTs for the safety and security of residents of Jammu and Kashmir would take necessary steps to prevent acts of violence, discrimination and other coercive acts against Kashmiris (including students enrolled with the institutions in the respondent states and the Union Territories) and other minorities in the wake of the terrorist attack in Pulwama.

 Pakistan's offensive against human intelligence led to suicide bombing in Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: The single biggest reason that kept Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar off the radar of the counter-insurgency agencies was the dismantling of human intelligence after Pakistan’s aggressive assault on native informers in the last five years. According to official documents exclusively accessed by TOI, Adil Ahmad Dar was categorised as a C-grade militant. In other words, Dar was considered by intelligence agencies as the least dangerous in the hierarchy of terrorists. The database, updated in December 2018, also reveals that there was no information about the existence and presence of Kamran and Farhad, the two top Pakistani Jaish commanders killed in a fierce gun battle in Pulwama on Monday. In the case of the two Jaish commanders, security forces kept scrambling about their identity due to lack of intelligence. “We were also confused about their real identity because of the Pakistan army and ISI’s code name strategy for terror operations. The ISI deliberately gives various aliases to each terrorist to mislead us. They often use aliases like Abu, Ghazi, etc., which creates a lot of confusion. That is why we don’t really know if there is a terrorist called Abdul Rashid Ghazi, the so-called IED expert who supposedly trained Adil Dar, the suicide bomber,” a counter-insurgency officer said. Officials of all security agencies admit that their own human intel has been in disarray ever since Pakistan’s army and ISI launched an offensive against locals in Kashmir following Burhan Wani’s killing in 2016. In the last three years, Pakistan-backed terrorists killed over 180 civilians, some of whom were informers, sources said. Officials declined to say exactly how many were informers. “But that did result in weakening of intelligence on the ground,” a highly placed source said. The intelligence agencies now realise their assessment about recruitment and infiltration has also been inaccurate. “In fact, going by the number of militants killed, it is now apparent that our statistics about recruitment and infiltration are underestimated,” an official said. For example, forces estimated that in 2018, around 140 terrorists infiltrated into the Valley and around the same number of locals were recruited into militancy. After having killed over 240 terrorists last year, they are as of today still left with around 300 terrorists. The massive gaps in the intelligence database has led to the thinking among the security agencies that they may have not analysed the trends in the Valley in the last ten years properly. “None of us really analysed why 2008 to 2010 were the worst in terms of street violence because of stone-pelting and clashes with forces. The years when we thought Kashmir peaceful, 2011 to 2013, actually had been the years when terror groups reorganised themselves and laid the foundation for the new-age militancy. The terror groups recruited massive numbers of overground workers (OGWs). An OGW is always a potential militant but just because OGW is the unarmed and silent part of society doesn’t mean he’s peaceful,” an official said. Another officer said, “We all happily treated the lull as good administration and effective policing and patted ourselves. But it is evident from the figures that since the hanging of Parliament attack convict and Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist Afzal Guru in 2013, something changed drastically in Kashmir.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Pulwama attack: AP CM Naidu challenges Amit Shah to prove his charge or apologise | India News - Times of India,"VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday challenged BJP president Amit Shah to prove the charge that he (Naidu) had supported Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan over the terrorist attack in Pulwama. “Prove your charge or apologise for the baseless remarks,” Naidu said in his open letter to Amit Shah. Shah, who was in Rajahmundry on Thursday had alleged that Naidu had more faith in Imran Khan than Modi. Strongly denouncing Shah’s remarks, Naidu said he had neither endorsed the statement of the Prime Minister of Pakistan nor he had spoken against Modi. Naidu said Shah should produce evidence in support of his allegation. “While we stood by soldiers and their families in this hour of grief, the BJP is trying to use it for its vested interests and to malign the Opposition. Pulwama incident is a clear case of Intelligence failure,” Naidu said. He said Modi should remember that in 2013 as the chief minister of Gujarat, he had demanded the resignation of the prime minister Manmohan Singh when terror attacks took place in Bihar and Kashmir. Modi should also remember the five questions that he had raised then. “It is surprising to note that the comments made by Narendra Modi then were not seen as a case of treachery. We do have the video clippings of the comments made by him and we can present them as evidence. How money is supplied to sponsor terror attacks through hawala route, when the security and Intelligence are with the Prime Minister,” Naidu wondered. Naidu asked Modi if he did not think it was his responsibility as the prime minister to ensure the safety and security of the citizens, which includes the personnel of the armed forces. “I have only reminded Modi the same set of questions raised by him against Manmohan Singh. I had asked if these questions are not applicable to Modi too,” Naidu said adding that his questions are being shown as anti-national while the conduct of the prime minister itself is questionable on the grounds of inefficiency. He said the BJP and Amit Shah are into the habit of mudslinging, without looking into the conduct of their prime minister and the Central government. “I am not in a position to take lessons on integrity from Amit Shah. It is clearly evident as to what had happened in Rafale deal, wherein the national interests have been compromised,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Pulwama attack: Pakistan to stay on FATF 'grey list' for terror financing | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan will remain on the grey list by FATF. Despite lobbying by it, FATF members voted to keep international pressure on Pakistan to clean up its act on terror support and terror financing. Pakistan has until October 2019 to either comply with the 27 demands made by FATF members or it could face the blacklist. In a strongly worded statement after a week-long plenary session in Paris, the FATF said, “however, it does not demonstrate a proper understanding of the TF (terror financing) risks posed by Da’esh, AQ, JuD, FiF, LeT, JeM, HQN, and persons affiliated with the Taliban. Pakistan should continue to work on implementing its action plan to address its strategic deficiencies.” Condemning the Pulwama attack, in its statement, “The FATF notes with grave concern and condemns the violent terrorist attack last week that killed at least 40 Indian security forces in Pulwama in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.” India has insisted Pakistan share details of funding of terror organisations. Earlier this week, France said they would work with FATF to keep Pakistan in the grey list, particularly after the Pulwama attack. Pakistani officials tried hard to get off the grey list, insisting they were in compliance. Pakistan had to demonstrate compliance on five counts by February, but sources from pari said there has been negligible movement by Islamabad. As a last minute gesture, Pakistan reinstated the bans on Falah-i-Insaniyat and Jamaat-ud-Dawa, two front organisations of the Lashkar-e-Taiba on Thursday. These organisations had been banned by a presidential ordinance by the former Nawaz Sharif government, but the ordinance was allowed to lapse by the Imran Khan government. The FATF listed out immediate actions Pakistan had to take before May 2019 citing “limited progress on action plan items” that Islamabad had to implement by January 2019 — firstly to demonstrate that they understand the gravity of the problem. Secondly, Pakistan should take “remedial actions and sanctions are applied in cases of AML/CFT violations (anti money laundering/countering finance of terrorism)”; enforcing controls on illicit movement of currency; investigating and prosecuting terror financing activity which “result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions”. In an in stinging indictment of the fact that Pakistan has not even implemented the financial sanctions against the terrorists banned under the UNSC’s resolutions 1267 and 1373, FATF demanded that Pakistan show progress on “preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services” of these designated terrorists. Pakistan’s case will be reviewed in June and if, by October, it has not shown progress, it could get into the blacklist, which would impact Pakistan’s appeal for an IMF bailout. China will take over the presidency of FATF in October 2019. Pakistan could hope for a better deal then.

Shiv Sena youth wing to take action against its workers for beating up Kashmiri students in Yavatmal | Nagpur News - Times of India,"NAGPUR: In the latest incident of assault on Kashmiri students after the Pulwama terror attack, students from the northern state studying in a college in Yavatmal were attacked and threatened by members of the Yuva Sena, the youth wing of Shiv Sena, police said on Thursday. As per the cops, the attack happened Wednesday night. The students were also threatened. A video of the incident has gone viral on the social media and a case has been registered at the Yavatmal police station. The students were attacked at around 10pm outside their rented accommodation on Waghapur Road. Yuva Sena secretary Varun Sardesai issued a statement on Friday in Mumbai condemning the attack and said that the organisation will take action against the accused. The students were from the Dayabhai Patel Physical Education College, police said. Yavatmal SP M Rajkumar said that some students from Kashmir, residing at Vaibhav Nagar under Lohara police station were attacked and threatened by some activists of Yuva Sena. “The Kashmiri students were returning home after having dinner outside when the activists intercepted them and slapped them. The victims lodged a complaint at Lohara police station on Thursday. Police identified the culprits and have also apprehended the main accused in the incident,” Rajkumar said. A victim of the attack said, “We were asked to say ‘Vande Mataram’ if we want to live here. They slapped us and abused us when we were returning from market on Wednesday evening,” he said. “The attackers asked us to vacate our rooms and return to Kashmir within four days,” the student said. We were warned that if we failed to return to Kashmir in this time frame, they will kill us. Some members in our colony intervened and saved us,” he added. “We have nothing to do with it (Pulwama attack). Whatever happening is happening outside.We have come here to study. If we go back to Kashmir, the situation over there is also bad. Neither can we study there nor are we being allowed to study here. Where will we go? We want to study here without any tension. We want to thank the police for helping us and now we are feeling a little better,” he said. In the video, the Yuva Sena workers are seen asking the students where they are from.

Narendra Modi must say what he was doing in initial 2 hours after Pulwama attack: Congress | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Stepping up its attack on Narendra Modi, the Congress said on Friday the Prime Minister must say what he was doing in the initial two hours after the Pulwama terror strike and alleged that he was either ""completely oblivious"" to the incident or ""insensitive"". The opposition also alleged, citing DD News footage, that the Prime Minister addressed a rally in Uttarakhand at 5.10pm via phone. Rahul calls Modi 'prime time minister', says he continued photoshoot hours after Pulwama attack newsThe BJP has dubbed the Congress's allegations as ""shameful"" and rejected the charges, saying the opposition party exposed its ""true colours"" after it kept a ""facade"" of standing with security forces and the government following the terror strike. Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari, at a press conference, said the Prime Minister not only addressed the press conference but continued with a photoshoot at the Corbett National Park in the hours following the Pulwama terror strike in which 40 CRPF jawans died after a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the paramilitary force's convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district. The Congress on Thursday had cited media reports to allege that Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued shooting for a film in the Corbett National Park on February 14 for ""self propagation"", and stayed put till evening despite the Pulwama terror attack in the afternoon that day. ""We want to ask the Prime Minister what was he doing between 3.10-5.10 pm, when you address a public rally in Uttarakhand through mobile phone,"" Tewari asked. The Prime Minister addressed the rally and did not speak on Pulwama, he said. ""Either the Prime Minister was completely oblivious, or the Prime Minister was insensitive. Either the Prime Minister did not know for two hours that a terror attack has taken place or the Prime Minister knew and was completely nonchalant about it,"" Tewari said.

"Pulwama attack: UNSC condemns 'heinous and cowardly' Pulwama terror attack, names Pak-based Jaish-e-Mohammed | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: The United Nations Security Council on Thursday identified India as a victim of terrorism emanating from Pakistan and asked member states to cooperate actively with New Delhi to bring the   perpetrators of the Pulwama attack to justice.  The statement came as a relief for India while embarrassing   Pakistan and its patron China   , which has long offered geo-political cover for Islamabad’s use of terrorism. Although, the statement did not explicitly name Pakistan, it identified the Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed, which bragged about the attack and whose leader remains free and protected by Pakistani state, while directly asking member states to “to cooperate actively with the Government of India and all other relevant authorities in this regard."" The statement also identified the place of the attack as “Jammu and Kashmir,” India’s official term for a state of the union, rather than other appellations used by Pakistan. “The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,"" the statement said, adding that any ""acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.” Pakistan comes under international pressure to act against terrorists & terror groups operating from areas under it… https://t.co/qsXn28EAtj— Raveesh Kumar (@MEAIndia) 1550797721000Pakistan has often rationalized terrorism and acts of violence in Jammu and Kashmir perpetrated by its terrorist groups and accomplices inside India to be fallout of India’s human rights excesses. Just the previous day, Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN Maleeha Lodhi had met   Secretary General Antonio Gutterres   and argued that the Pulwama incident “reinforces the need to address the root cause of violence in occupied Jammu and Kashmir and to find a peaceful solution to the longstanding dispute in accordance with several UN Security Council resolutions.” The most significant UN resolution 47 relating to Kashmir actually directs Pakistan to withdraw from the portion of Jammu and Kashmir that it has occupied - something Pakistani officials are loath to recall- as the first step in a three-step process. Lodhi also argued that “India's no-talk posture is not only irresponsible, but it puts at stake, the peace and security of all of South Asia,” despite countries of the region, notably India, Afghanistan, and Iran, identifying Pakistan as the source of terrorism endangering peace in the region. China is reported to have balked at the language of the statement before agreeing to fall in line, as long as Pakistan was not explicitly named and shamed. The UNSC smackdown set the stage for renewed efforts by India, France, US, and UK among the Permanent Five members to designate JeM and its leader Masood Azhar as terrorist entities after years of protection for him from Pakistan under cover from China, whose veto power enables it to stall the process. On Thursday, Pakistan was embarrassed into   reissuing a ban on the Lashkar-e-Taiba   , the other terrorist group that launches attacks in India under the tutelage of the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI. The UN-designated terrorist, LeT chief Hafiz Saeed has been freely making speeches in Pakistan after the ban expired and Pakistani authorities made no effort to keep him in check despite terrorism charges against him.

TOI has accessed two official documents, one by the Pakistani military based in Balochistan and another a notice sent to local administrations in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), which reveal that the neighbouring country has begun   preparations for war with India   . Pakistan authorises forces to respond to ‘any Indian aggression’Pakistan army based in Headquarters Quetta Logistics Area (HQLA) in Quetta Cantonment wrote to Jilani Hospital on February 20 to arrange and plan for medical support in view of the possibility of a war with India. “In case of emergency war on the eastern front, Quetta logistics area is expected to receive injured soldiers from civil and military hospitals of Sindh and Punjab. After initial medical treatment, these soldiers are planned to be shifted from military and civil public sector to the civil hospital in Balochistan till the period of availability of beds in CMHs (civil military hospitals),” the letter to Jilani hospital’s Abdul Malik by one Asia Naz, force commander, HQLA, said. It adds: “The Logistics Area has a comprehensive medical support plan encompassing all military and civil hospitals in the province. In case of an eventuality besides bed expansion of military hospital, civil hospitals have already been assigned the responsibility to reserve and earmark 25% of their bedding capacity for the injured soldiers.” The instructions also asked private hospitals to earmark 25% of their beds for the said purpose along with the allied facilities. The letter ended with the claim: “We have received an overwhelming response from all over Pakistan and anticipate the same from Balochistan.” On Thursday, the PoK government sent a letter asking the local administration in Neelum, Jehlum, Rawalkot, Haweli, Kotli and Bhimbher areas along the Line of Control (LoC) to issue advisories for their residents, warning them about a possible retaliation by the Indian Army.   TOI had on February 17 reported   that Pakistan has relocated terrorists from launchpads along the LoC. Intelligence sources said these relocations include those camps opposite 19 Division on the Indian side besides those in Lipa Valley opposite Naugam sector and Rawalkot and Khuiretta opposite Nowshera and Poonch in India’s 25 Division in Rajouri. The PoK government letter also advised residents to take “safe routes whenever commuting” besides avoiding congregation. “Those residing near the LoC and (those who) do not have bunkers should get one made immediately,” it said, adding that they should also avoid unnecessary lighting at night. The local administration has also been asked to advise inhabitants to avoid unnecessary travel near the LoC. Animals should not be taken to fields near LoC either, it said.

Grief engulfed the nation but there was a lot of anger among the public. I decided to pay my tribute with a 15 cm tall shield. I used 40 match sticks to represent the martyred jawans. I then used the chemicals present on the tip of the matchstick to draw their faces. The 300 match sticks around them represent the youngsters of the country, who stand with them in this time of grief. I drew the national flag using right next to the jawans using water colours. I have also made a jawan holding a gun using clay conveying that his fight continues. Below the creation is a cap that sheds tears. This is to show that the entire nation is crying. It took me two days to complete the entire creation.” Raja has been conveying messages of social relevance through his art for over two decades now.

 Will fully use our share of water going to Pak: India | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A week after the terror attack in Pulwama by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad, India on Thursday reminded its neighbour of its resolve to fully utilise its share of waters from Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers that currently flow across the western border. Flagging India’s claims under the Indus Water Treaty (IWT), water resources minister Nitin Gadkari tweeted about the country’s decision to utilise its share of water and emphasised that ongoing projects were being given status of national projects — a move to ensure adequate funds and avoid delays. India had taken the decision to fully utilise its share of water under the IWT post-Uri attack in 2016 and stepped up efforts to implement several projects in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir.

All the above Projects are declared as the National projects.— Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) 1550753769000Under the Indus Water Treaty, signed between the two countries in 1960, waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Sutlej) are allocated to India while the country is under obligation to let flow water of the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum and Chenab) to Pakistan. India can even use the water from the western rivers for its domestic purposes, irrigation and generating hydro-electric power to an extent. India will, however, have to complete ongoing projects to begin utilising its share of the water from the eastern rivers. Though the government had stepped up its efforts in this direction post-Uri attack, the projects are under different stages of implementation. Once India completes these projects, it would be able to divert and store water of eastern rivers for projects. Gadkari on Thursday tweeted: “We will divert water from Eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Sutlej) and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. The construction of dam has started at Shahpur-Kandi on Ravi river. Moreover, Ujh project will store our share of water for use in J&K and the balance water will flow from 2nd Ravi-Beas Link to provide water to other basin states.” He also tweeted that all these projects were declared as the national projects. The Ujh project, which the minister referred to, will come up in Kathua district in J&K. It will store around 0.65 million acre feet (MAF) of water from Ujh (a tributary of Ravi) to irrigate 30,000 hectares and produce over 200 MW of power. Similarly, the government had in December last year approved implementation of the Shahpur-Kandi Dam Project on river Ravi in Punjab. Implementation of this project will help minimising some of the water of the river Ravi which, at present, is going waste through the Madhopur headworks downstream to Pakistan.

" Amid attacks, SC to hear plea to protect Kashmiris | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a petition seeking its intervention to protect Kashmiris who are being targeted in different parts of the country in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack. Appearing before a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves asked that the petition be heard urgently and requested the court to list the case for Thursday itself. But the CJI said it was neither “possible nor needed” that the matter be taken up on Thursday but assured that the case would be heard. The matter has been listed for today. Referring to reports of incidents in different states where “mobs and vigilante groups engaged in vitriolic hate speech and began attacking and threatening Muslims and Kashmiris”, the petition said the Centre and state governments had not been effective in curbing such incidents. “On the contrary, it would appear that the respondents may even be sympathising with the mobs,” the petition said. “The incidents that have happened are not isolated or unconnected. The conspiracy invariably begins at the top where politically senior persons and senior religious leaders have instigated their followers to attack and kill Muslims and Kashmiris,” the petition said.

 CRPF plans to enhance annual leaves for jawans on Army lines in combat zones | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: On the lines of the Army, the CRPF is mulling to enhance the number of leaves given to its combat personnel, as part of a renewed push to provide enhanced rest and recuperation to its troops deployed extensively for anti-terrorism and anti-Naxal operations in the country, officials said Thursday. The force is planning to enhance by seven days the number of casual leaves given in an year to its jawans and officials, up to the rank of Commanding Officer (CO), they said. At present, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troops, up to the CO rank, get 60 days of EL (earned leave) and 15 days of casual leave (CL) while being in an operationally active area like Jammu and Kashmir, Left Wing Extremism deployment or counter-insurgency duties in the north east. It is now planning to enhance the CL to 28 days. In the Army, all the officials -- from a sepoy to the Army chief -- get 60 days of EL and 28 days of CL whether they are deployed in a peace station or the operations grid. This system helps a jawan to plan his off-duty activities and vacations better, they said. The proposal was much favoured by the troops and officers of the force after CRPF Director General (DG) R R Bhatnagar visited his formations for two days in the Kashmir valley post the February 14 Pulwama attack, they said. Forty CRPF personnel were killed while five others were injured after a suicide bomber triggered a deadly explosion next to a force bus plying on the Jammu-Srinagar highway as part of a convoy. The official said all field commanders of the over 3-lakh personnel strong force have been asked to firm up their views after which the CRPF will move the Ministry of Home Affairs seeking its sanction to the proposal. ""The move will greatly benefit the troops in planning their time when they are off duty. ""They can better spend their time with their families or get their domestic work done or to simply say make the most of their holidays, given the hectic and stressful work schedule they have on job,"" the official said.

Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, addressing a press conference, launched an all-out attack on the government and the prime minister over the Pulwama terror strike. In his hunger for power, the prime minister has forgotten ""raj dharma"" (duty of governance), he alleged. Citing media reports in Hindi news papers, Surjewala gave a timeline of events saying the the terror attack happened at 3:10 PM on February 14 with the Congress reacting at 5:15pm. ""The prime minister also knew about it, yet the PM, a person who claims himself to be a pseudo nationalist, continues to shoot a film (for Discovery channel) for self propagation in Corbett National Park in Ramnagar,"" he claimed.

" Congress, AP CM Naidu politicising Pulwama attack: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India","RAJAHMUNDRY: BJP president Amit Shah has come down heavily on the Congress and chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu for allegedly politicising the terror attack in Pulwama. He alleged that Naidu had faith more in Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan than prime minister Narendra Modi. Addressing BJP leaders during his whirlwind tour of Rajahmundry on Thursday, Amit Shah said 90 per cent of all the promises made in the AP State Reorganisation Act 2014 were fulfilled by the Centre. He also accused Naidu of misusing the central funds meant for construction of capital city Amaravati and Polavaram dam across the river Godavari. Amit Shah’s visit was marred by protests by Telugu Desam Party activists, who raised slogans asking the BJP leader to go back. There was also a dharna by students. The police took the protesters into custody before Shah landed at the city airport. He said Modi is giving utmost priority to the security of the country. Modi is sustaining zero tolerance with regard to the security and safety of the country. “Prime minister is giving free hand to security forces to curb Pak-sponsored terrorism and retaliate Pulwama attack. Army has the liberty to fix time and attack terrorists,” he said. Shah was in Rajahmundry to open BJP city office and address party leaders from Rajahmundry, Kakinada, Amalapuram, Eluru and Narsapuram Lok Sabha constituencies. He alleged that Congress is politicizing Pulwama terror attack and added that Congress minister Navjot Singh Sidhu is happy to hug Pakistani army chief. He recalled that the Congress had termed “antinational slogans” shouted in JNU as freedom of speech. India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru is the root cause of the problem in Jammu and Kashmir. If Patel were elected as the first prime minister of the country, Kashmir problem would not have arisen. He also targeted Chandrababu Naidu saying that none has the right to question of the patriotism of the BJP. “Naidu is staging dharnas in various states. If he really wants to protest, he should stage protest in front of his TDP office as the government did nothing for AP in the last five years. By joining hands with Congress Naidu is criticizing that BJP is obstructing development in Andhra Pradesh,” Shah alleged. Of the 14 important assurances made in the AP Reorganization Act, the Centre has already fulfilled 10 promises. The Centre has sanctioned 20 prestigious national institutions to AP. The TDP government is misusing the central funds and corruption is prevailing everywhere in the state. He reminded that most of the beneficiaries under Prime Minister Awas Yojana are from Andhra Pradesh. The Centre has spent Rs 182 crore to develop Rajahmundry airport. He said Rs 55,474 crore has been invested in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh until now. “Naidu has backstabbed NTR, Vajpayee and now Narendra Modi.

"Jaish-e-Mohammed:   Jaish planning even bigger strike, warn intel inputs | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: Emboldened by its success in the Pulwama suicide bombing, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) plans to carry out another fidayeen attack of a much bigger magnitude, intelligence intercepts of conversations on February 16-17 between JeM leadership in Pakistan and its terrorists in Kashmir have revealed. As per the intercepts, exclusively accessed by TOI, Jaish terrorists resolved to execute another bombing to cause massive casualty to Indian security forces. On Wednesday, a top intelligence official said various inputs from different quarters indicated that there could be a major attack either in Jammu or outside J&K. Quoting intel sources,   TOI had reported on February 19   that a 21-member JeM squad, including three suicide bombers, had infiltrated into Kashmir in December last year to launch three attacks, including two outside the Valley. The intercepts picked up by the agencies also revealed that JeM is to release the video of the preparations of the Pulwama suicide bombing preparations. Intelligence analysts said the release of the video is intended to glorify 20-year-old Adil Ahmad Dar, who rammed his explosive-laden Maruti Eeco van into one of the buses of the 78-vehicle CRPF convoy, killing 40 jawans on February 14. The video could help Jaish recruit more gullible and radicalised Kashmiri youth into suicide bombing missions, an analyst said. JeM has also claimed that it was the terror group’s former operational commander Mohammad Waqas Dar who had planted the IED at Nowshera in Rajouri last week in which Army Major Chitresh Bisht was killed. However, police officials said the entire communication among Jaish terrorists seemed to be a ‘psychological operation’ targeted at terrorizing India. “But since we have intercepted the communication, we cannot ignore it. We are on high alert and trying to corroborate the threats through other means too,” a senior police officer said.

Speaker rejects SAD resolution against Pakistan on Pulwama attack | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab assembly speaker Rana KP Singh on Wednesday rejected SAD’s resolution condemning Pakistan government and its Prime Minister Imran Khan for the Pulwama attack, saying that rules do not permit it. The speaker added that state legislative assembly had already condemned the Pakistan government on the issue. SAD leader and former finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa had raised the issue in the assembly, saying the Pakistan Prime Minister had given an irresponsible statement despite knowing that the ISI was supporting such terror attacks in India. On this issue, the SAD and BJP legislators had even entered the well of the House earlier in the day before walking out of the assembly. They had also raised an objection, saying only the resolutions brought by the government were being passed and not those of the opposition parties. They also claimed that their party members were being given less time to address the House. According to the speaker, the SAD had failed in giving 15 days prior notice for moving the resolution in the assembly. However, Dhindsa claimed, “The speaker said there was no justification under Rule 254. He said this issue is not concerning the Punjab legislative assembly. If they want to reject any resolution, they can take any ground.” The SAD legislator added that since it was a matter of urgency as the Pulwama terror attack happened on February 14, the issue was raised one day earlier. “So how can you give a 15 days’ notice. It is just that they are trying to reject our resolution without any reason since we are in the opposition,” he said. BJP MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu said their resolution was neither against any individual or any other political party in Punjab. Some state ministers, including chief minister Amarinder Singh, had even spoken on the issue in the state assembly, he added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

The Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) bus from Lahore to Delhi was diverted “to avoid any untoward incident” in view of a protest by Bharatiya Kisan Sangh members and local residents at Rai block in Sonipat district near Delhi-Haryana border in the wake of the Pulwama attack, according to cops. “The administration decided to divert the bus after it got to know of the protest. The route was therefore diverted from Murthal to Sonipat city bypassing Rai block and then to Narela in Delhi,” sub inspector Kuldeep Deswal, station house officer of Rai police station, told TOI. “The route was, however, restored on Wednesday,” he added. The PTDC bus usually reaches Rai around 4pm on its way to Delhi. Some 30 police personnel under the supervision of a DSP-rank officer, are part of its security team.

I don’t need to prove my loyalty to anyone. This is my country and will always come first to me because I believe India was founded on secular ideas, not bigotry and hatred,” the 42-year-old, who was threatened and abused by miscreants twice, said with new-found confidence on Wednesday. Acknowledging the support from various quarters, including the adinistration and the police, the Kashmiri doctor on Wednesday said: “We will stay here. I have been living here for half my life. Hence, Bengal is as much a home to me as Kashmir. The people here are humane. I don’t know if I would have received the kind of support elsewhere but it has been simply overwhelming for me and my family,” he said. On the forefront of the effort to make the family feel secure were fellow doctors. Members of a doctors’ association visited his home and assured him of help. Others have condemned the incident and vowed to stand by him. “He is a thorough gentleman with a good heart. This kind of witchhunt after the Pulwama attack was uncalled for. By making such threats, we will alienate even those Kashmiris who are in the mainstream,” said oncologist Sharadwat Mukherjee. “Why should a doctor who had nothing to do with the attack face isolation and humiliation? We are condemning such incidents. We will see to it that the city does not let him down,” said cardiologist Kausik Chaki. “This kind of hooliganism is unfortunate,” added peadiatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri. West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti had considered intervening when she learnt about the kids’ plight. “The doctor was extremely concerned about his children’s trauma. It appears some parents had asked their children not to speak to the two girls. This is so sad. I had decided to step in if the situation did not improve, but thankfully it did,” said Chakraborti.

" In virtual world, ‘traitor trackers’ wage their own war | India News - Times of India","Papri Banerjee’s family is frantic. The lecturer at Icon Commerce College, a private institute in Guwahati, has been missing since the morning of February 17 after being interrogated by police in connection with two FIRs — one filed in the Assam capital, the other in Silchar — accusing her of public mischief and other offences. In the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack, Banerjee had posted comments on social media in which she had also referred to atrocities by armed forces in Kashmir. Banerjee has been suspended from her job. “We have filed a case against her and interrogated her. Since the sections she was charged under were bailable, she was allowed to go home,” Guwahati police commissioner Deepak Kumar told TOI. Since she has gone missing, police officers said she will be arrested after she re-surfaces. According to her family, Banerjee was disturbed by several threats of physical violence and sexual assault made against her by people online. “This might have prompted her to leave the house and disappear,” said a relative. A Silchar resident, Subhashish Choudhury, had filed an FIR against Banerjee. On Monday, eight persons, including students were booked in Aligarh, Lucknow, Moradabad, Shahjahanpur, Mau, Rampur, Ballia and Basti districts, while police were working on a case from Noida where a youth pursuing MBA from a private institute had allegedly posted “objectionable” content. Following the attack and the public outcry that has followed, dozens across India – a police team from Tripura is on its way to Mysuru to arrest a person alleged to have posted “anti-national” messages online – have been charged for using what authorities believe to be seditious or mischievous language. Organised groups of online activists have been gathering details about people who have posted what they believe to be anti-national comments, mounting pressure on employers and educational institutions to take action against them. One of the groups, ‘Clean the Nation’, formed on Facebook, had claimed to have “acted” against 50 such ‘anti-nationals’. The group was formed on February 16. Its account has now been deleted. Asked about the charges, Prashant Kumar, ADGP, Meerut, said, “If someone is blatantly promoting cessation, or justifying the damaging deed of an unfriendly nation, that automatically comes under the purview of sedition. In short, anything which demeans your own country is anti-national. All precautions are taken by the police department while applying it (the sedition charge).” Rights activists, some of whom said that the timing of the posts “was all wrong”, worry that the police cases and court appearances would have a lasting impact on the youths — almost all of them young — and affect their lives and careers.

 Pulwama attack: India won’t share blast info with Pak | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India is unlikely to provide evidence to Islamabad regarding the role of top Jaish-e-Mohammad leadership, ensconced in Pakistan, in the February 14 Pulwama terror attack and would rather present this proof to friendly nations across the world to unmask the complicity of Pak-based elements in perpetrating terror, a senior government functionary said on Wednesday. The statement seemingly reflects the thought process in the government, which is not in favour of going through the rigmarole of presenting dossiers to Pakistan on terror attacks that only end up gathering dust there even as the perpetrators roam free, be it with respect to 26/11 Mumbai attacks or Pathankot airbase strike. “There is no question of giving any evidence to Pakistan. Rather we will share it with friendly countries to expose the role of Pak-based elements in Pulwama and other terror attacks on Indian soil,” stated the functionary. Pakistan PM Imran Khan had on Tuesday said he would act against the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack — in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed — if India shares “actionable intelligence”.

Pulwama attack news: Maruti Suzuki engineers at ground zero to help probe | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency is looking for local Jaish-e-Muhammed terrorist Mudassir Ahmad Khan for his suspected role in the   Pulwama attack   , even as it believes that the   military grade explosives (RDX)   for the bombing might have been brought by one of the groups that infiltrated through the international border in Jammu. A recent report by NIA on infiltration from Jammu border said that over 35 Jaish and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists had crossed over in the past more than a year. “We are yet to interrogate any person suspected to be associated with the bombing, but it is our understanding that the planning had taken some months, explosives smuggled in tranches from Jammu border and specialised IED makers travelled to assemble it,” said an officer requesting anonymity. Sources said Mudassir Khan’s name has been shared by intelligence agencies for being part of the group that executed the bombing and they expect him to give more leads about when the explosives, IED maker(s) and those who supervised the attack travelled to India. The agency is also taking help of Maruti Suzuki engineers to identify the owners of the Eeco van used in the blast. A metal plate having some numbers on it was found from the blast site. The engineers, who travelled to Srinagar on Monday, are now ascertaining the vehicle’s year of manufacturing, the showroom it was supplied to and the person who bought it. The video clip of bomber   Adil Ahmad Dar   , through which JeM claimed responsibility for the attack, is also being examined by experts from the Chandigarh forensic laboratory as he appears to be reading a script. “The video is being examined for any superimposition, voiceover and modulation,” said an officer. NIA and J&K police have also examined some local Kashmiris, including those who have operated as over-ground workers (OGWs) for terror outfits in the past, to get clues about the perpetrators.

A JeM operational commander and his aides, who were involved in the February 14   terror attack on a CRPF convoy   , were killed in the battle. “We did not want civilian casualties. We took it on our chin. Brigadier Harbir Singh, who was injured during the gun battle, was on leave. When he realised the operation had been launched, he cut short his leave and went straight to join the operation.

What proof do you want? Captain Amarinder Singh asks Pakistan PM Imran Khan | Ludhiana News - Times of India,"PATIALA: Trashing Imran Khan’s statement that India had no evidence of his country’s involvement in the Pulwama terror attack on CRPF jawans, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday asked angrily if the Pak PM wanted New Delhi to send the bodies of the soldiers. “What proof is he talking about, should we take the bodies there? Masood Azhar is in Pakistan and doing things from there, and everyone knows it. Every day our soldiers are being killed at the Line of Control – so who’s killing them?,” asked the Chief Minister, declaring that the entire world knew what Pakistan was doing in Kashmir and other parts of India. “They (Pakistan) were behind 26/11 and India gave all the proof to them, but they did nothing,” Captain Amarinder pointed out that even in the Rajasansi blast (Nirankari Bhawan) a Pakistani grenade was used, clearly exposing their involvement. The CM later twitted “Dear @ImranKhanPTI you have Jaish chief Masood Azhar sitting in Bahawalpur and masterminding the attacks with ISI help. Go pick him up from there. If you can’t let us know we’ll do it for you. BTW what has been done about the proofs of Mumbai’s 26/11 attack. Time to walk the talk.” The CM, who was in Patiala on Tuesday to inaugurate two mega development projects, said Imran is a `courtesy ISI’ prime minister, so how else can one expect him to react, said the Chief Minister, when asked by media persons to react to the Pakistani Prime Minister’s statement on the Pulwama attack. In an informal chat with media persons the Punjab CM said the Pakistani Prime Minister, along with their Army Chief General Bajwa, were killing Indian soldiers and innocent people. India cannot and should not tolerate this, he said, reiterating that “if they one of ours, we should kill two.” Earlier, addressing the gathering at the foundation stone laying ceremony, the Chief Minister underlined the importance of peace for development but said India needed to avenge the killings of its soldiers. Surgical strikes could be one way, but it was up to the centre to decide what course of action it should take, he said, making it clear that he was not in favour of war. In response to another question, the Chief Minister lashed out at the Akalis during whose rule the sacrilege cases had threatened to disrupt the state’s peace and said nobody found guilty of these incidents would be spared. At the same time, he appealed to the people to respect all religions. “The Akalis, during their decade log regime, exploited the farmers and put them to extreme hardship through tardy procurement and other anti-farmer policies,” the Chief Minister said, adding that his government had successfully ensured three seamless back-to-back procurements since taking over in March 2017.

pulwama Attack:   We will definitely retaliate if India attacks us: Pak PM Imran Khan | India News - Times of India,"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan warned India on Tuesday that any military action against his country would invite swift retaliation, saying matters would spin out of control should the Modi government carry out its threat to avenge last week’s killing of CRPF jawans in Pulwama by ISI-controlled terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Muhammed. “If you think that you can carry out any kind of attack on Pakistan, Pakistan will not just think about retaliating, we will retaliate. There will be no way to respond other than to retaliate. And after that, where does the matter go? We all know that starting a war is easy. Starting it is in one’s hands, but ending it is not in our hands. Where it will go, God knows best. That’s why I hope that better sense will prevail,” Khan said, his tough pitch leaving many to wonder whether he was referring to the grim prospect of an escalatory spiral between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Khan insinuated that India was cranking up tensions because of the coming Lok Sabha polls and suggested that the terror attack showed why the Modi government should agree to holding talks. “I understood this is India’s election year and the narrative of blaming Pakistan will make it easier to get votes from the masses,” he added. Imran offers no condolence to grieving families of CRPF men Khan’s six-minute video message was the first time he was speaking on the jihadi terror attack in which 40 CRPF men were killed. He claimed that Pakistan was ready to cooperate with India. “I would like to make the Indian government an offer. If you have actionable evidence, share it with us. We will take action. Not because we are under pressure, but because it is our policy,” he said. However, his recorded remarks were marked by the absence of even proforma condolence for the grieving families of the CRPF personnel. The video, which appeared to have been edited several times before being aired, had Khan striking a bellicose note while also playing the victim with a pronounced air of injured innocence. He said India had rushed to accuse Pakistan of complicity in the terror attack without producing any evidence and was, thus, guilty of being, at once, the accuser, the jury as well as the judge. Khan blamed India for the terror strike. “In India, there is a need for new ways of thinking— what is the reason these Kashmiri youths have reached a point where they don’t have fear of death any more. There must be some reason,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Of anti-Pak protests, hotel ban and a date gone wrong | India News - Times of India","Army havildar Sheo Ram was cremated with military honours in his village in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, on Tuesday. He was among the five martyred in Monday’s counter-terror operation in Pulwama. His wife, in full term pregnancy with their second child, was told about his death on Tuesday morning, following which she collapsed and was referred to hospital in Jaipur fearing complications. A relative told TOI, “What we feared happened and she collapsed soon after the cremation. Though it is still 10 days to her due date, doctors said the stress and trauma could result in an early delivery.” Anti-Pakistan slogans reverberated on the cremation grounds of Basa Tikri village in Meerut on Tuesday as thousands thronged to pay their last respect to Ajay Kumar, 27, who was among the Army personnel killed in Pulwama on Monday. Emotions ran high as the martyr’s two-year-old son Arav lit the pyre. Basa Tikri, a village of 800 residents, has at least one member of every family serving in the armed forces. The village decided not to light stoves and cook for the day as mark of respect for Kumar. The jawan’s wife, Dimple, who is five months pregnant, said, “ Action should be strong enough to serve as deterrent against unabated killings of Indian soldiers.” Kamlesh Devi, Ajay’s mother, said, “So many of our sons have died. Pakistan is not so big that it cannot be destroyed by India.” Some hotel owners in Agra have put up pamphlets asking Kashmiris to keep away. They told TOI that they did not like the local population of Kashmir supporting militants. Rajjab Ali, manager of Kishan tourist lodge, said, “The ban will continue until our martyrs get justice.” Dealers of dry dates in Indore have decided to cut off trade ties with Pakistan in protest against the Pulwama attack. Many of them have cancelled orders and are ready to pay demurrage for declining to accept deliveries.

Governor, please reinstate everything removed by her. Mufti should now hand over 40 people for pubic execution if she really feels hurt for our 40 soldiers’ culpability (sic).” PDP’s official Twitter handle called her claims “concocted stories and ridiculous allegations” and tagged Delhi Police promising legal action against her. Mufti, in her tweet called Singh “diabolical and ignorant.” “She seems to possess an unfettered imagination with an aim to persecute Kashmiris. Ironical that she teachers ethics and law!” she said. When TOI contacted Singh, she said she wrote the tweet after watching a video clip of General GD Bakshi. “It was openly being discussed on television that it was a PDP man who broke through the first two barriers. He was shot at by the army and died. Those armymen are still languishing in jail.” Singh, however, didn’t realise that she was describing the Budgam firing incident of 2014 where two youths were shot in Chiteram village when they sped past two army checkpoints. Asked about Mufti taking objection and PDP promising legal action against her, Singh alleged that the PDP chief was saying this under the direction of JNU scholar Shehla Rashid Shora.

Pulwama attack takes toll on Delhi-Lahore bus service | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Pulwama attack and the resultant strain in Indo-Pak relations have had a cascading effect on the otherwise popular Delhi-Lahore bus servicerun by Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). The first bus from Lahore after the attack had a lone passenger on board travelling till Delhi. The service is now operating with a handful of passengers as many have cancelled their bookings. On Tuesday, when the DTC bus from Lahore arrived at Ambedkar Stadium bus terminal near Delhi Gate in central Delhi, the number of Delhi Police personnel deployed for security was almost thrice the number of passengers. As the heavily-protected bus came to a halt, three women passengers got down. The bus then left for the Indraprastha depot for overnight parking. The passengers looked not only jaded after the 12-hour journey, but also tense. “I had gone to Pakistan to visit my sister. I decided to return as the atmosphere is tense at the moment,” said one of the passengers who didn’t give her identity. “I have travelled by this bus quite a few times, but the journey this time was eerie as there were only two other passengers,” she added. The other two passengers, who were also Indians, refused to talk. “The bus has a seating capacity of 40 and it usually runs full or with at least 30 passengers on each trip. Since February 14, the number of passengers has fallen drastically,” said a senior DTC official. “While the bus that came from Lahore had just one passenger post the terror attack, the one leaving Delhi for Lahore also saw a drastic reduction in the number of passengers,” he added. “We are getting incessant queries about the bus service whether it is still operational. Many people have cancelled their bookings in the last few days,” the official said. The DTC bus service to Lahore operates every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) buses leave Delhi every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. On the return trip, the DTC buses leave Lahore every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, while PTDC buses leave every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The ticket is Rs 2,400 for adults and Rs 1,500 for children. “The PTDC bus on Tuesday left empty from Delhi. If the situation remains the same, a decision will have to be taken regarding continuance of the service. With few passengers, it is not economical to run six buses between Delhi and Lahore. As it is, the bus service doesn’t make much profit even when it runs on full occupancy,” the DTC official said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Army to Kashmiri militants’ mothers: Tell sons to surrender or they will be killed | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: The Indian Army appealed to the mothers of Kashmiri militants on Tuesday to counsel their sons to give up the gun or they would die holding it. “In Kashmiri society, a mother has a great role to play. I would request the mothers of Kashmir to please request their sons who have joined terrorism to surrender and get back to the mainstream. Anyone who has picked up the gun will be eliminated, unless he surrenders,” the GOC 15 Corps, Lt Gen K J S Dhillon, reiterated forcefully at a press conference here after Monday’s gun battle at Pinglan, Pulwama. The corps commander said the forces had suffered heavy casualties in the 18-hour operation on Monday — aimed at wiping out the top leadership of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) in the valley — in order to avoid killing local Kashmiri civilians. The forces had lost five men while trying to eliminate the operational commander of Pakistani terror outfit JeM and his aides who were involved in the February 14 suicide bombing of the CRPF convoy. “We did not want civilian casualties. That is the risk we took. We took it on our chin. Brigadier Harbir Singh, who was injured during the gun battle, had been on leave. He was at home but when he realised that the operation had been launched at midnight, he cut short his leave, came back to Kashmir and went straight to the operation site. He was leading his men from the front, and so was J&K deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Amit Kumar. Our men were commanding from the front because we wanted no collateral damage,” the corps commander said. Security forces had a tough time on Monday handling the operation on the one hand and, on the other, a massive, violent civilian mob trying to rescue the terrorists at the Pinglan encounter site. “I request Kashmiri youth to stay away from operations sites before and after the encounter for their own safety. Anything can go wrong due to crossfire and leftover explosives,” Gen Dhillon said. Though J&K inspector general of police (IGP) S P Pani said the local recruitment of youth into militancy has dipped in the last few months, Gen Dhillon said infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan into Kashmir has continued even through the winter. The corps commander said the Pakistan army and its spy agency ISI were involved in last week’s suicide bombing of the CRPF convoy. But the main people of the JeM’s top leadership in the Valley have been eliminated. “I would like to inform that in less than 100 hours of the Pulwama terrorist attack we have eliminated the JeM leadership in the valley, which was being handled by JeM from Pakistan,” he said.

" Often quick to slam CRPF and police for their action, NHRC took 5 days to simply condemn Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Quick to issue a notice to the government when Kashmir valley was gripped with violence following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani in July 2016, it took National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) five days to simply “condemn” the killing of 40 CRPF jawans in Pulwama last week. Reacting on the incident after 120 hours, NHRC issued a statement saying, “The NHRC is disturbed over the killing of more than 40 CRPF personnel in a terrorist attack on their convoy near Awantipora on the Srinagar-Jammu highway on the February 14, 2019 and condemns it.” The federal human rights body, which has often slammed forces like CRPF, police and army for their action in J&K, north east etc, even didn’t bother to check the exact number of martyrs as it mentioned “more than 40 CRPF personnel” in its press statement. NHRC spokesperson Jaimini Kumar Srivastava could not be reached on the faux pass committed related to number of personnel died in the car bombing. Officials in security forces said that NHRC only believes in slamming the security forces and the Jawans do not have any human rights according to it. The NHRC statement added, “The scourge of terrorism is one of the major factors leading to violation of human rights in our society.

The name of the scheme is Thodu Needa, one that stands company to us and also shades us from hardships. I am happy that the money is going for a right cause. I decided to donate it for this cause because no sooner than the maturity cheque arrived, I received the tragic news of the Pulwama attack.

Pulwama attack: Military grade RDX used points to Pakistan | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In what would eliminate doubt over Pakistan's involvement in the Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF men were killed last Thursday, forensic experts have concluded that the suicide bomber had used high intensity 'military grade' explosives (RDX) which terrorists procure from Pakistani defence forces. The forensic experts have also concluded that the explosive-laden vehicle used by the Jaish-e-Muhammed terrorist was a Maruti Eeco van. In their report on preliminary findings after visiting the spot of Thursday's ghastly attack, experts said although RDX is a ""very stable"" explosive and the one used in the car bomb may have been brought to India months back, it was ""definitely assembled"" in India and that too ""within a range of 5-7 km of the blast site"". '21-member Jaish squad entered Kashmir in December'Although rain washed away some vital evidence after the attack and a final forensic report is awaited, a senior expert claimed the RDX used in the blast could be 50-70 kg as explosives in the range of 100-300 kg would have caused ""more damage"". ""The final report would take some time, but it appears that more than one highly trained bombmaker travelled to India to assemble it and the trigger switch, detonator and power fuse might have been attached to it closer to the time of attack,"" the expert told TOI, requesting anonymity. Intelligence sources said every gram of RDX available with the Indian Army is audited but the Pakistani military is known for supplying explosives to terror groups. The expert, who specialised in study of IEDs and explosives used in bombings world over, has also opined that this is the ""first ever such bombing"" in India mirroring vehicle-borne suicide bombings carried out by Islamic State and al-Qaida terror groups in West Asian countries. There was a massive black smoke after the blast, and everything melted, like seen in car bombings in West Asia. He also ruled out the Pulwama bomb being completely similar to the 2000 Badami Bagh suicide car bomb and the one used in the 2001 J&K assembly attack in which a terrorist rammed a car into the gates of the assembly before blowing it up. ""While the teenager in the Badami Bagh incident had panicked before the attack, the J&K assembly bomber also took some time to trigger the bomb,"" he said. This shows that Pulwama bomber Aadil Ahmad Dar was fully prepared mentally to blow himself up along with the CRPF jawans, a theory which gives little credence to the possibility of somebody else triggering the bomb from a distance. Intelligence and investigation agencies are worried that military grade explosives such as RDX, PETN (Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate), TNT (Trinitrotoluene) are being used by terrorists in Kashmir.

Punjab CM: Up to Sidhu to explain his comment on Pulwama attack | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday said everyone had the right to voice their mind and it was up to Navjot Singh Sidhu to explain his stand on Pulwama attack. At the same time, he hit out at Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for disrupting the proceedings of the House ahead of the budget presentation ""to gain political mileage"". Amarinder told mediapersons that Sidhu was a cricketer while he himself was a soldier, and both had different viewpoints on things, adding that the minister must have realized that he had gone overboard with his Pakistan visit. Sidhu does not understand defence intricacies and had possibly reacted out of friendly motive, and the minister's intentions were surely not anti-national, and he must have got the message, he said. Amarinder blamed Akalis for creating a ruckus on the issue in the Vidhan Sabha for political gains. Budget presentation is a vital proceeding, which the people of the state await eagerly every year, he said, attacking Akalis leaders for targeting Sidhu to divert attention from such an important assembly matter. Reacting to the slogan-shouting and walkout by the Akalis, Amarinder said the party had clearly lost all sense of morality and uprightness, as evident in their desperate efforts every day to reduce the House proceedings to a mockery.

Abdul Rashid Gazi:   Pulwama attack mastermind among 3 Jaish terrorists killed in encounter | India News - Times of India,"PULWAMA: In the first major encounter after the February 14 terror attack on a CRPF convoy, security forces in Kashmir eliminated three Jaish-e-Muhammed terrorists, including IED expert Abdul Rashid Gazi, the suspected mastermind of the strike, in a prolonged gun battle in Pulwama district on Monday. However, they also lost five of their own men, including a 34-year-old Army Major.  Police officials said the Jaish terrorists were part of the suicide squad behind the horrific Pulwama bloodbath that has triggered nationwide outrage. Eleven security personnel, including a brigade commander, a lieutenant colonel and a deputy inspector general of police, were injured in the gunfight.  A J&K Police statement confirmed that Jaish commander Kamran alias Fahad, Rashid Gazi alias Lukman, both Pakistani, and a local terrorist, identified as Hilal Ahmed, were killed in the encounter. Security forces said JeM chief Masood Azhar's nephew Mohammad Umair could be hiding in south Kashmir.  The 20-hour-long gunbattle between the security forces and the terrorists erupted in Pinglan, a neighbourhood adjoining Kakpora, the home town of Jaish terrorist Adil Ahmad Dar who had rammed his vehicle into the CRPF convoy in Lethpora, Pulwama district.  TOI had reported on Sunday that while Azhar has been confined to an army hospital for an unknown ailment in Rawalpindi in Pakistan, he sent Umair to recruit three local fidayeen in Kashmir. The operation allowed the forces to avenge the Pulwama bombing to some extent. But the mood was sombre due to the deaths of Major D S Dondial, Sepoys Ajay Kumar, Hari Singh and Havildar Sheo Ram and J&K Police head constable Abdul Rashid.  In the gunfight, a civilian, Mushtaq Ahmed, was also killed while his home, along with three neighboring houses, was gutted. The terrorists took shelter in one house and moved between the others.  The fierce gun-battle, which seemed to have ended by 4pm, resumed after a long pause, as thuds and booms of guns and IEDs rang out, injuring DIG south Kashmir Amit Kumar, Brigade Commander Harbir Singh and Lt Col Rahul Gupta. They were fired at by the third terrorist who was hiding in a cow shed. Tension gripped the village as dense smoke rose from the encounter site and several rounds of fire reverberated in the nearby neighbourhoods. Several youths from adjoining areas rushed to the spot and began pelting security forces with stones, hidden under their pherans, to rescue the terrorists and disrupt the operation. Police had a tough time managing the violent mob of hundreds of locals. Indian Army pressed three Mi-17 helicopters into service while the operation was on. Two drones were also hovering over the encounter site, from where flames and fumes leapt up.

 India wants Pulwama revenge now: Amarinder Singh | India News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: Demanding an ""eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"", Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday wanted coercive action against Pakistan now in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack, saying India should get two of them for every soldier killed in the carnage. Asserting that the entire country was ""fed up"" with the senseless killings of Indian soldiers in Kashmir, Singh said the coercive action could be military, diplomatic or economic, or a combination of all the three. Calling for the death of two ""of them"" for every Indian soldier killed in the attack on the CRPF convoy last Thursday, Singh said it's clear that the Pakistan Army was calling the shots, with Prime Minister Imran Khan also a ""plant"" of the military. ""We should get 82 of them since 41 of our men have been killed,"" asserted Singh, a former army captain, while demanding an ""eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"". Singh said it was for the Centre to decide what action should be taken, but it was clear that some measures have to be taken urgently. ""India wants it now,"" he said. ""No one is asking anyone to go to war, but these killings of soldiers are not a joke. Something has to be done. I'm fed up, the country is fed up,"" he said, according to an official release issued here. The chief minister said the Indian government should take ""whatever measures"" are required and ""we will support them."" ""Pakistan can't hold India to ransom just because they are a nuclear nation, even we are nuclear,"" he said, asserting that Indian forces had defeated them during the 1999 Kargil war in spite of their nuclear capability. In any case, Islamabad could never resort to use of nuke weapons, as international pressure would not allow that, he said, suggesting New Delhi should call Pakistan's bluff against such threats. There is palpable anger across the country after the killing of CRPF jawans by a Jaish suicide bomber in Pulwama, he said. ""If they (Pak-backed terrorists) kill our soldiers, we have to do something,"" he said. The statement of the senior Congress leader came just days after his cabinet colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu called for dialogue with Pakistan even after the Pulwama attack. Sidhu had condemned the ""cowardly"" attack by the Pakistan-based terrorist group but he also called for dialogue to find a ""permanent solution"" to end the bloodshed. Calling for a proactive role in destroying the safe havens of terrorists, Amarinder Singh said terrorist organisations within Jammu and Kashmir have to be dealt with. He said the Army should go after Jaish-e-Mohammad in Kashmir, instead of firing pellets and blinding youth. ""Let's win their (youths) hearts and minds with love,"" he said. The chief minister also said that questions are bound to be asked on intelligence failure in Pulwama attack and the central government will have to aanswer them. He called for a global diplomatic offensive against Pakistan, mooting harsh measures to put a lid on Islamabad's anti-India actions. The surgical strikes had not achieved the desired objective, he said, adding that Islamabad needs to be made to understand that Indian soldiers are not dispensable.

 Cross-LoC bus service suspended in J&amp;K's Poonch | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: The weekly Poonch-Rawalakot cross-LoC bus service was suspended on Monday in view of the prevailing law and order situation in Jammu, following the recent terror attack on a CRPF convoy in south Kashmir, a senior officer said. A curfew was imposed in Jammu city on Friday following massive anti-Pakistan protests and sporadic incidents of violence over the terror attack in Pulwama district, which left 40 CRPF personnel dead on Thursday. ""The cross-LoC (Line of Control) bus service was suspended in view of the prevailing law and order situation,"" Poonch district development commissioner Rahul Yadav told PTI. The passengers were accordingly informed well in time about the suspension of the service, he said. On the cross-Loc trade, Yadav said it will not take place on Tuesday due to public holiday on account of Guru Ravi Das's birthday. ""The decision to carry on the trade between the two sides will be taken on Wednesday after a review of the situation,"" he said. The trade via Chakan-da-Bagh in Poonch district on this side and Rawalakot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) takes place from Tuesday to Friday every week. Billed as the biggest confidence building measure, the bus service was started on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad route in Kashmir on April 7, 2005 and the Poonch-Rawalakot route in the Jammu region on June 20, 2006, to facilitate easier trade and travel between the divided families of Jammu and Kashmir and PoK.

 Terrorists using remote motorcycle keys to trigger IEDs in Kashmir: Report | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The commonly used anti-theft remote alarms or keys used in motorcycles and vehicles are being increasingly used by terrorists to trigger IEDs in Jammu and Kashmir, a possibility suspected in the recent Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy that   killed 40 personnel, a latest report has revealed   . According to the report, prepared by investigative and security agencies working in the counterterrorism grid in Jammu and Kashmir, terrorists ""suddenly shifted their tactics"" last year to deploy a remote control mechanism to   blast improvised explosive devices   (IEDs) using electronic tools such as mobile phones, walkie-talkie sets and anti-theft devices used to secure two- and four-wheelers. The report accessed by PTI said these electronic gadgets are ""easily available"" in the market and terrorists operating in Kashmir Valley are using them to ""fabricate"" remote-controlled IEDs as they want to not only avoid one-to-one combat with the forces which are conducting operations almost every day against them but also to inflict maximum casualties. ""It is expected that the militants in J&K may use more anti-theft devices, similar to the devices used by Naxals in other states, in the future. Hence, the security forces deployed in J&K need to be more vigilant,"" the report on the history and emerging trends of IEDs in the state said. Investigators probing the Pulwama attack suspect that the deadly blast on February 14 was executed by a lone Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist by blowing off a strong combination of RDX-mix explosive, laden in a car, next to a troop-carrier bus plying as part of a convoy on the Jammu-Srinagar highway. The report stated that sometime back, an IED attack was engineered to target the personnel of the Army's 44 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) unit in Shopian district and it was found that the explosive was trigerred using a remote key used to lock and unlock a two-wheeler. ""Use of anti-theft device in remote-controlled IEDs is common in the red corridor (Left Wing Extremism-affected states) and the use of these devices by militants in J&K reveals that there could be a nexus between the terrorists operating in the valley and the Naxals,"" it said. However, senior security officials working in the counterterrorism grid in the Valley denied getting ""solid proofs"" of any direct links between the terrorists operating in J&K and the Maoists. The report also analysed the recent history of IED blasts in Kashmir and found terrorists were using military-grade explosives such as RDX, PETN (Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate), TNT (Trinitrotoluene) and commercial explosives such as slurries and ammonium nitrate for fabricating IEDs. ""Recovery of incendiary chemicals (in J&K in the past) indicates the terrorists' intention to use these chemicals in sabotage activities in the state and against security forces,"" the report said, adding both military-use and commercial electric detonators are ""commonly"" being used by the terrorists to launch terror attacks or blasts. It added that the terrorists continue to use the ""rudimentary"" command-wire mechanism (by joining wires) to blast IEDs, probably to ""hit the targets precisely"". ""Militants have been adopting different methods, technologies and strategies to detonate IEDs to inflict maximum casualties on the security forces in J&K. It is believed that the renewed tactics and modus operandi of the forces might have forced the militants to avoid direct confrontation with them (security forces) and instead use IEDs which offer the terrorists a scope to carry out attacks by staying behind the screens,"" it said.

There was intel lapse: Ex-RAW chief on Pulwama attack | Hyderabad News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: Former Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Vikram Sood said that an intelligence lapse resulted in the Pulwama attack. Talking at a seminar in Hyderabad at Administrative Staff College of India on Sunday, Sood said, “It would not have happened without lapses. The attack wasn’t a job done by one man. Somebody spotted and trained him. There would have been a whole team. Had intelligence agencies known about it, it could have been averted. There was information that Jaish-E-Mohammed is active in Kashmir.” Sood said that India should have a consistent and apolitical approach on the Kashmir issue. He said that Pakistan will not learn a lesson with a soft approach. When asked about a possible reaction to the Pulwama terror attack, he said, “As Prime Minister Modi said, appropriate action will be taken at the right time and right place.” On United States sharing intelligence, Sood said, “US intelligence sharing is more a rhetoric than a reality.” He said that China is a bigger threat than Pakistan. Former union home secretary K Padmanabhaiah Pakistan had formulated a national policy long ago after realising they cannot defeat India in a traditional war. “Peace is not in Pakistan’s DNA, and no measure of confidence building measures can bring about a change in the attitude of that government.” He said, “India’s security was under threat from all sides of our borders.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

"Masood Azhar: Just one slap from Army man rattled Jaish chief Masood Azhar, recalls his interrogator | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The dreaded architect of some of the most gruesome terror attacks in India,   Maulana Masood Azhar   , was an ""easy man"" to handle in custody and he got shaken up on the first ""slap"" from an Army jawan prompting him to blurt out details of his movements, says a former police officer who interrogated him after his arrest in 1994. Pulwama attack: China weighing options on Masood Azhar issueAzhar, who had used a Portuguese passport to enter India through Bangladesh and reach Kashmir, was arrested in February 1994 in Anantnag in South Kashmir. In the custody, the intelligence agencies did not have to do much work on Azhar who started speaking after the first slap from an Army officer and gave deep insights into the functioning of terror groups operating from Pakistan, the officer said. ""He was an easy man to handle and a slap from an Army officer had shaken him completely,"" former Director General of Sikkim Police Avinash Mohananey, who interrogated Azhar many a times during his two-decade tenure in the Intelligence Bureau, told PTI. After his release in exchange of passengers of hijacked IC-814 flight of Indian Airlines in 1999 by the then BJP government, Azhar formed Jaish-e-Mohammed and scripted many audacious terror strikes in India, including on Parliament House, Pathankot air force base, Army camps in Jammu and Uri, and the latest suicide attack on CRPF in Pulwama which claimed the lives of 40 personnel. While in custody, Azhar, in his early 50s now, shared information about recruitment process and functioning of terror groups in Pakistan at a time when the intelligence agencies were still grappling to understand the proxy-war unleashed by Pakistan's espionage agency ISI, said Mohananey, a 1985-batch IPS officer who headed the Kashmir desk in the agency at that time. ""There were several occasions when I met him in Kot Balwal jail and interrogated him for hours together. We did not have to use any coercive method as information flowed consistently from him,"" he said. Azhar gave the Indian agencies vital insights into diversion of Afghan terrorists into Kashmir Valley and merger of Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and Harkat-ul-Jehad-e-Islami (HuJI) into Harkat-ul-Ansar, represented by him as its general secretary, he said. After his arrival into India from Bangladesh in 1994, Azhar had travelled to Saharanpur before reaching Kashmir where he held meetings of warring factions of HuM and HuJI to formulate a common policy, Mohananey said. ""I came on a forged Portuguese passport for ensuring that HuM and HuJI are together in the Valley. It was not possible for me to cross the Line of Control on foot,"" the police officer recalled Azhar telling them. Azhar used to give a detailed description to any question that was asked to him, he said. The Jaish chief, during his stint as a journalist with 'Sada-e-Mujahid', a tabloid published from Karachi, had travelled in 1993 with a group of Pakistani scribes to some countries drumming up support for ""Kashmir cause"", he said. Mohananey recalled that Azhar would often boast that police could not keep him in custody for long as he was important for Pakistan and the ISI. ""You are underestimating my popularity. The ISI would ensure that I am back in Pakistan,"" the police officer recalled him as saying. Surprisingly, some foreigners were kidnapped from Delhi 10 months after his arrest in February 1994 and the kidnappers had demanded his release. The plan failed with the arrest of Omar Sheikh, who was also released in exchange of the 1999 hijacking, and was later involved in the gruesome beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan. Another attempt to release him was made by a shadow group of Harkat-ul-Ansar, Al-Faran, which demanded his release in exchange of five foreigners kidnapped in Kashmir in July 1995. Before shifting out to another posting, the officer said, ""I met him again in 1997 when he was in the same jail. I informed him that I was proceeding out to a new posting to which he wished me good luck."" ""I was at new posting when I heard about his release on December 31, 1999 in exchange for passengers of IC-814. He really meant that we will not be able to keep him for long,"" he said. The then BJP-led NDA government had released Azhar, along with Omar Sheikh and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar alias 'Latram', in exchange of passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from Kathmandu to New Delhi which was taken to Kandahar in Afghanistan. After the negotiations failed with hijackers, the government succumbed to their demands and the then external affairs minister Jaswant Singh took the three terrorists to Kandahar in Afghanistan in a special plane to ensure the release of passengers of the hijacked plane.

"Pulwama terror attack: Time for talks over, world will have to act now, PM Narendra Modi says | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the Pulwama terror attack has shown that time for talks is over and hesitation to take action against terrorism and those who support it is akin to encouraging the menace. Without naming Pakistan, Modi, after holding delegation-level talks with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, said the world should unite to take concrete action against terrorism and those who support it. After the talks, the two sides signed ten agreements in diverse areas like defence, nuclear energy, tourism, information and communication technology, and agriculture. ""I and President Macri agree with the view that terrorism is a serious danger to world's peace and stability. The cruel attack in Pulwama shows that the time for talks has passed.

Abdul Rasheed Ghazi:   Pulwama attack mastermind Abdul Rasheed Ghazi killed by security forces in Kashmir | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In a big breakthrough, security forces on Monday gunned down top Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) commander Abdul Rasheed Ghazi alias Kamran, in a 12-hour-long encounter with multiple JeM terrorists in Pulwama area. Ghazi was a Pakistani national and the brain behind the   Pulwama attack   . Live updates: Security forces kill Pulwama attack mastermindTOI had   reported on Sunday   that Ghazi may still be in the Valley. In fact, Ghazi had a narrow escape during an encounter which took place days before the vehicle-borne IED attack on CRPF convoy last Thursday. A local terrorist was killed and a soldier was martyred in that encounter. Ghazi, who was an Afghan war veteran and an IED specialist, was the one who trained Adil Dar, the terrorist from Pulwama who drove the explosive laden vehicle into the CRPF convoy. On January 3, TOI was the first to report about the top Jaish commander having crossed the border on December 9 and hiding in Pulwama. The security forces had intensified the manhunt for him since the attack. Masood Azhar gave nod for Pulwama attack from Army base hospital in PakistanGhazi was one of the closest and most trusted aide of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Maulana Masood Azhar. He was believed to be in his mid thirties and joined Jaish more than a decade ago. He had been trained in warfare techniques and IED preparation by the Taliban and was known to be one of the finest hands of Jaish. ""He returned to PoK in 2011 after fighting the NATO forces in Federally Administered Tribal Area and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Since then, he has been the most sought after jihadi trainer who specialises in Deeni and Askari (literature and weaponry) training in camps operated by Jaise and ISI across PoK,"" a source said. Ghazi was sent to the Valley after security forced killed Masood Azhar's nephew, Usman, who was a highly trained sniper. Soon after his killing, Jaish-e-Mohammed released a statement vowing to seek revenge.

It is believed that Azhar sent Ghazi and two other top commanders to the Valley in the first week of December who then began to give final shape of a deadly plan which was to be executed around February 9, the death anniversary of Parliament attack mastermind Afzal Guru.

Pulwama:   Pulwama attack: Why it will take more to isolate Pakistan this time | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India had cut off all efforts to resume bilateral dialogue with Pakistan after the attack on the Pathankot airbase in January 2016. India's diplomatic measures : Now, following the deadly Pulwama (Jammu & Kashmir) attack on February 14 in which 44 CRPF personnel were martyred, India has withdrawn Pakistan's most favoured nation and increased duties on imports from Pakistan. India had granted Pakistan MFN status way back in 1996 but the neighbouring country had not yet reciprocated. Withdrawal of the MFN status will significantly hit Pakistan's exports to India, which stood at $488.5 million (around Rs 3,482.3 crore) in 2017-18. But, besides these measures, there's little else that India can directly (at the bilateral level) do against the country diplomatically. Pressure has to be put on other nations to support India's efforts. US is talking to Taliban: Pakistan is currently reaping the benefits of its support to the Taliban by appearing to broker peace negotiations between them and the US. This means Pakistan believes it can negotiate for itself a greater manoeuvring space both vis-a-vis India as well as its support to terrorism and terror financing. Also, the talks with the US have emboldened Taliban and jihadist groups linked to it like the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) (Taliban was one of the organisations that funded Masood Azhar to set up his terror outfit). We'd gone easy on China: India wants the United Nations to designate Jaish chief Masood Azhar a global terrorist, but China has been blocking it. China is a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council and an ally of Pakistan. The country has repeatedly foiled India's bid to list Azhar as a global terrorist, saying there is no consensus in the top organ of the world body on this issue. India's general policy has been to raise the issue (together with US or UK) in the 1267 committee of the UN as a way to keep the pressure on China and to expose its support to a terror leader. But after the (informal) Wuhan summit between Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping, India eased the pressure. In all of 2018, India did not push the Azhar case in the UN. That pressure will have to be cranked up all over again. Saudi is with Pakistan too: As India builds a diplomatic case against Pakistan, the forthcoming visit of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia (he is visiting Pakistan before stopping over in India and going on to Malaysia, Indonesia and China) could be an opportunity to build a diplomatic case against Pakistan. However, despite growing cooperation between India and Saudi after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit in 2016, the latter remains much closer to Pakistan (it has helped keep Pakistan's economy afloat with a $6 billion loan) in the security sphere.

Pulwama news: Pulwama attacker had drifted from al-Qaida affiliate to JeM | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The suicide bomber Aadil Ahmad Dar who drove an explosive-packed car into a CRPF convoy and   killed 40 CRPF jawans   in the Pulwama attack, didn't suddenly drift into Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Muhammed. Fresh details which emerged during probe revealed that Aadil was already ""fully radicalised"" when he joined Jaish, the Deobandi terror outfit which has declared war on India as part of what it sees as an ""Islamic mission"" to Balkanise India. Pulwama suicide bomber was inspired by Taliban 'victory' over US in AfghanistanSources said Aadil was a member of Kashmir-based Zakir Musa-led Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, which claims to be affiliated to Al Qaida. The outfit, which came into being in July 2017, is now almost defunct with most of its members killed by security forces. Aadil, sources said, got radicalised around the age of 20 when he joined Ansar Ghazwat ul-Hind. However, he soon switched to JeM, perhaps, because he found the al Qaeda-linked outfit to be a small vehicle for his plans as a jihadi. In another development following JeM's involvement in the deadliest-ever attack in Kashmir, sources said Jaish chief Maulana Masood Azhar and his brother Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar may have vacated their Bahawalpur headquarters and moved to a safe location held by Pakistani military and ISI. Probe agencies are gathering details on role of Masood Azhar's nephew Mohammad Umar, who had entered India around May-June last year from PoK to carry out ""major attacks"" in India.  As per intelligence inputs exclusively accessed by TOI, while Umar came to India around May-June, JeM sent Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar's former bodyguard - Mohammad Ibrahim alias Ismael - to Delhi via J&K.  The input stated that Umar and Ismael were directed to make logistical arrangements, including procurement of explosives to launch a ""fidayeen"" attack in Delhi. Ismael was in direct touch with Mufti Rauf Asghar, a US designated terrorist. Their visit to India happened after JeM's top leaders met in April 2018 at its Manshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, camp where they decided to carry out ""spectacular"" attacks in India to avenge the killing of Azhar's nephew Talha Rasheed by the security forces in November 2017.

Pulwama news: Did handlers use peer-to-peer software service to contact Pulwama bomber? | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Security forces and intelligence agencies in J&K suspect that Jaish-e-Muhammed handlers of the   Pulwama bomber   had been using a peer-to-peer software service - YSMS - or a similar mobile application to correspond with him till December 2018, avoiding mobile phone surveillance completely. Intelligence sources have accessed what they believe is a copy of YSMS messages exchanged between the JeM group after the   Pulwama terror attack   .  ""Successful funeral of Mujahidin Jish Muhammad,"" read one of the messages. ""Indian soldiers killed and dozens of vehicles destroyed in frenzy attack,"" read another.  The YSMS uses an ultra high radio frequency model to send encrypted text messages. In essence, a radio set is attached to a cellular phone with no SIM card inside it. The radio set is a small transmitter with WiFi capability. It is the WiFi that is used to connect the mobile. The receiver should be in ""line of sight"" from sender's phone for proper communication. YSMS application has been available on the Dark Web since 2012 but terror outfits in Pakistan have now developed a new version which uses a frequency which has not been detected by any monitoring device since December.  ""JeM and Lashkar terrorists in Pakistan have added a fresh layer of encryption which cannot be seized by any surveillance device at the moment. Which is why they may damage them as soon as they engage with Indian security men during encounters,"" said an official. Sources said use of YSMS was first discovered by them when the Indian Army had nabbed a Pakistani militant Sajjad Ahmad in 2015 but they are yet to crack its code.

It added that “as a first step”, the security and allied arrangements provided to Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, Abdul Gani Bhat, Bilal Lone and Shabir Ahmad Shah, were being withdrawn with immediate effect. The order said a separate review would be held on Wednesday. Sources in J&K government added that the state police will review if there are any other separatists having government security and facilities and “will withdraw these immediately”. Those likely to be affected include Hashmi Qureshi, another separatist leader, with home ministry sources indicating that a decision had already been taken to withdraw cover to five leaders including Qureshi. The decision to strip separatists of security detail is a political signal that the Centre is set to follow a policy to no-tolerance towards Hurriyat leaders, some of whom face cases for terror funding in which NIA has filed a chargesheet. The trial in these cases is underway. One Hurriyat leader also faces a money laundering case which is being pursued by ED. The demand that the group which, while ostensibly working for “ self-determination” of Kashmiris has been unbashedly pro-Pakistan in its orientation, be stripped of security cover is quite old , and has been raised whenever Hurriyat have provoked by discarding the pretense of neutrality to support Pakistan as well as the jehadi terror that the neighbour has stoked. But governments, while indulgent, stopped short of heeding it; particularly because of the apprehension that Paksitan may get the secessionists bumped off and blame the killing on India: something which happened in the cases of Mirwaiz’s father who was killed by ISI-backed terrorists for not pursuing their agenda. Sajjad Lone’s father Abdul Gani Lone was also killed by Pakistan-backed terrorists after he turned inconvenient to generals in Rawalpindi. As per details put out by J&K government last year, it spent nearly Rs 10.88 crore from 2008 to 2017 on providing security cover to various separatist leaders including Mirwaiz, Bhat, Molvi Abbas Ansari, Bilal Lone, Salim Geelani and Fazal Haq Qureshi. “All security and any vehicles provided to them will stand withdrawn by today evening. No security forces or cover should be provided, under any pretext, to them or any other separatists,” said the official. A Hurriyat spokesman termed the government order a propaganda and said it would have no bearing on the Kashmir dispute or the situation on ground. The central government is also expected to take a strict stance on foreign travel by Hurriyat leaders. While not many of the top separatists are known to have a valid passport at present, with government ensuring that validity is restricted to one year, it is unlikely that their passports will be renewed anytime soon. Two of the top Hurriyat leaders, Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Yasin Malik do not figure in the list of those stripped of security detail as they do not enjoy state protection or any other government facility. Geelani is currently under house arrest. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Crowd chants patriotic slogans to vent ire on Pakistan | Patna News - Times of India,"BEGUSARAI: Atmosphere was charged and emotions ran high as the crowd gathered here on Sunday expected something from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to soothe their anger over the terrorist attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were martyred at Pulwama in Jammu & Kashmir Thursday last. The people at the Ullao Maidan kept shouting ‘Bharat mata ki jai’, ‘Vande Matram’ and ‘Pakistan murdabad’ throughout the public event where PM Modi inaugurated and laid the foundation for projects worth Rs33,000 crore in the state. People had started pouring in at the venue since morning and their numbers had surged by 11am. Every time some one raised the slogan like ‘Bharat mata ki jai’, the crowd roared in unison. The youths however, seemed a little disappointed with the PM’s restrained speech on the Pulwama attack. Though the Sunday event was organized to lay foundation stones and inaugurate several big projects under different ministries, the crowd kept shouting ‘khoon ka badla khoon se lenge’. The simmering anger over the Pulwama incident was palpable all around and the crowd wanted the prime minister to announce not anything less than a direct action against Pakistan. Kalyanesh Agrawal, a college employee, said the entire country is boiling with anger over the misadventures of Pakistan-sponsored terrorists who took lives of our brave soldiers. “Fortunately, the country has a strong and decisive prime minister. I am convinced Modi ji will keep his promise of ‘blood for the blood’ to assuage the people’s hurt feelings. The crowd roared when the PM, accompanied by CM Nitish Kumar and governor Lalji Tandon and Union ministers landed at the venue in three separate helicopters. Amid continuous slogan-shouting and fluttering of tricolour as well as BJP flags, the crowd seemed restless to hear something concrete against Pakistan and the terrorists. The people roared when PM Modi said, “Jo aag aapke dil me hai wahi aag mere dil mein bhi hai ((I feel the same fire which is raging in your hearts).” The crowd yearned for more, but the PM after paying tributes to Bihar martyrs Sanjay Kumar Sinha and Ratan Kumar Thakur shifted the focus of his speech to the various projects and their benefits to the people of the state. Nishant Ranjan, an orthopaedic surgeon, said PM’s one line was enough to give indication of his government’s mind. “He is the Prime Minister and matters related to national security and allied strategy cannot be discussed in public,” Nishant said.

 CRPF men shifted to other buses after two of them developed snags | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: A defect in two vehicles of the CRPF led to accommodating their passengers in other buses which were part of the entourage hit by the suicide bomber in Pulwama on Thursday. A brief note prepared by the CRPF after the terror attack revealed that in the 78-vehicle convoy, 14 had stopped at the transit camp in Qazigund and another two developed defects at the same place, 25 km from Pulwama. That forced many transient CRPF jawans to be accommodated in other vehicles.

There were 309 escorts and 2,159 transient soldiers in the convoy. The convoy reached Qazigund at about 2.15 pm. But 14 vehicles stopped at Qazigund and another two developed snags. However, the note does not explain why 14 vehicles halted at the transit camp along with the two defective vehicles.  At this point, another 16 bullet-proof vehicles had joined the convoy. However, intelligence sleuths believe that the bomber identified the bus which was the fifth in the sequence with at least four vehicles carrying senior officials ahead of it.

An old graveyard is situated at a slight elevation, across the road. Ignoring the chilly winter wind, CRPF men grimly patrol and guard the spot where they lost 40 of their colleagues last Thursday. One of the two jawans guarding the site stops us and orders us to walk away from the enclosed location of the deep crater left by the bombing.

Clad in a camouflage jacket, ASI Desraj hides his tears as he remembers his colleague Madan Sharma, who was escorting the convoy in Pulwama, standing on the edge of the highway, 25km from Srinagar. Between Desraj and Sharma, they shared everything from duties on the Pulwama stretch to jokes about their different lifestyles. ""We would often pull his leg by offering him chicken but he never broke his vegetarianism. We would fondly call him Panditji,"" Desraj recalls.  A day before the tragedy, Desraj was rostered for another duty 50 metres away where a bulletproof vehicle was stationed while Sharma replaced him as an escort. Sharma fell to the IED blast. ""We had been staying together for the last 10 months but had bonded over favourite TV shows and literature. He was from Dehradun and I from Delhi. On that particular day, I was on the next post and he was on guard here and escorting the vehicles,"" says Desraj, his voice choking. ""Everyday I see his bed empty; it is just mind-numbing.""

 Decided to add new features to our convoy movement to and from Kashmir: CRPF DG | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The CRPF has decided to tweak the standard operating procedures (SOPs) framed to secure its convoys, in the wake of a ""new threat"" where   an explosives-laden vehicle   was detonated by a terrorist alongside the force's bus in Pulwama killing 40 personnel, the chief of the paramilitary force said on Sunday. ""We have decided to add new features to our convoy movement to and from Kashmir,"" CRPF director general R R Bhatnagar told PTI after undertaking a two-day tour of the Valley in the wake of the February 14 attack, the worst against security forces in Jammu and Kashmir in three decades. ""Apart from traffic control, there will be changes in the timings of convoy, their halt locations and movement in coordination with other security forces like the Army and the J&K police,"" he told the news agency. He said two convoys have been run after the attack at Latoomode in Pulwama and these new measures are being tested and implemented as part of the standard operating procedures (SOPs). Home minister Rajnath Singh,   after his tour to the Valley   post the blast, had said it has been decided that movement of civilian vehicles will be restricted when convoys of security forces move in Jammu and Kashmir. The DG said over the last two days he and his commanders in Kashmir have ""discussed and laid down a new strategy"" to not only secure the movement of convoys but also to enhance security measures for regular operations. ""I would not like to go into the specifics but we are formulating some strategies. This is something that we have done in the past and these things are dynamic."" ""In view of this new threat, where a suicide bomber is suspected to have come close to our vehicle and detonated explosives, strategies are being worked upon,"" Bhatnagar said. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) chief said there was no ambush on any CRPF convoy in the last two years and the effort is to neutralise such threats as much as possible. Asked if there was an intelligence input suggesting that a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED) could be used by terrorists in Kashmir to hit the forces, Bhatnagar said that he would not talk about things related to operations and intelligence. A senior official, however, said there was no ""specific input"" and such an attack was completely new for the security forces in the Valley. The DG, when asked about sending all troops from Jammu to Srinagar on aircraft to avoid the vulnerability of road movement, said there is ""no alternative"" to convoys. Air courier service for the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) has been increased by adding flights from Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu and back in 2018, he said. Many times the helicopters and planes of the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Indian Air Force (IAF) are also used to airlift CAPF troops to the Kashmir Valley, the DG said. ""As the Jammu-Srinagar Highway was closed due to landslides, the convoy operated on February 14 after a gap of 10 days and there was a large backlog of personnel who were to be transported to Srinagar from the transit camp of the CRPF in Jammu,"" a CRPF official based in Srinagar said. ""Thus, running of the convoy has very little to do with the availability of air effort, which can only supplement the convoys and not replace them,"" Bhatnagar said. The proposal for introducing Delhi-Srinagar-Delhi flight (seven days a week) and a separate Jammu-Srinagar-Jammu flight (four days a week) has also been sanctioned by the home ministry and would soon be operational, the DG said. This would more than double the present capacity to 1,892 seats per week for the forces deployed in the Kashmir Valley, he said. During his visit to the Valley, the CRPF chief also met his troops at various units in and around Srinagar and also went to the blast site, about 20 km from Srinagar.

"Pulwama terror attack news: Pulwama attack not handiwork of single man, says former RAW chief | India News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: The terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district which killed 40 CRPF jawans, was not the handiwork of a single man but a group, former Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Vikram Sood Sunday said. He also attributed the incident to security lapses somewhere. ""The entire episode of Pulwama was not a job done by one man ... There would have been a whole team behind him,"" he told reporters after addressing a seminar on 'External Intelligence for National Security' here. ""This kind of an incident does not take place without a security lapse somewhere ... they had knowledge about the movement of the (CRPF) vehicles. There must have been group of people who did it,"" Sood said. Asked about India's possible response, Sood said, ""It is not a boxing match ... punch for punch won't do."" The timing and place would be chosen by the security forces, as the Prime Minister had said, he added. Forty CRPF personnel were killed on Thursday in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir when a Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district. To another query on India not getting China's support to proscribe JeM chief Masood Azhar as ""global terrorist"" at the United Nations Security Council, Sood said ""China is playing to Pakistan's requests.. China is the only safeguard for them in UN when it comes to having Masood Azhar declared a terrorist"". He claimed that China was doing it because it harboured apprehensions that Islamic outfits in Xinjiang province might maintain links with their terrorists in Pakistan. ""So, it is a quid-pro-quo. China will do this for Pakistan ... Pakistan will make sure that these terrorists don't give trouble to them in Xinjiang,"" said Sood, a career intelligence officer for 31 years. Earlier, addressing the seminar, Sood noted that the animus that Pakistan nurtures for India is permanent. ""It's not going to go away. No amount of peace talks, no amount of concessions, and 'bada bhai business' is going to help, they (Pakistan) are not interested and they don't want them. They want us down and out. We have to frame a policy that takes that into account"". Highlighting the threat posed by China, he said, ""I think China and not Pakistan is the bigger threat. China in control of Pakistan is even worse. So, we have to prepare for that."" Pakistan is a useful ploy for China to use against us and they will keep using. We have to take our own measures."".

"Pune: CRPF jawan alleges assault by policemen, cops deny charge | Pune News - Times of India","PUNE: A 28-year-old CRPF jawan alleged that he was ""assaulted"" and ""handcuffed"" by police personnel in Baramati taluka here on Sunday without any provocation when he went to invite them for a condolence meet for the 40 CRPF soldiers who were killed in the Pulwama terror attack. However, a senior police officer strongly refuted the allegations levelled by the jawan, Ashok Ingawale, a resident of Songaon village, who is currently on leave. The officer in turn claimed it was Ingawale who got into a brawl with the policemen. The incident took place at Pune's Baramati rural police station. Talking to PTI, Ingawale, who claims to be posted in Jammu and Kashmir, said he was part of a small 'mandal' (community group) in his village and it was decided to hold a condolence meeting for the slain CRPF soldiers during a Shiv Jayanti programme on Tuesday. ""On Sunday afternoon, I, along with my cousin, who had recently retired from the Indian Army, and one more youth, went to invite the senior officers of the Baramati police station for the February 19 programme,"" he said.

Ingawale, who went to the police station with the other two on a two-wheeler and in his uniform, claimed he showed his identity card to the police personnel and offered to pay the fine for triple riding, but they did not listen to him. ""They further alleged I was drunk. The police personnel then took me to a room where there was no CCTV camera. There I was beaten up by 10 to 15 police personnel, my uniform was torn and I was handcuffed,"" he alleged, adding that the policemen even abused him. Ingawale also denied that he was drunk. ""There is no question of me being drunk because I have been working for the cause of alcohol de-addiction in the area.

The CRPF jawan added that he had lodged a complaint against the ""high-handedness"" of police at the Baramati police station. Additional superintendent of police Sandip Pakhale refuted Ingawale's allegations. He said Ingawale indulged in triple riding and when the personnel at the police station stopped him, he started using intimidating language. ""When he was taken inside the police station, he got into a brawl with the policemen and damaged chairs,"" Pakhale said. He claimed Ingawale himself went into the lockup to show that he had been arrested. However, when he realised that the ruckus may cost him his job, he changed tack and accused the policemen of assaulting him, Pakhale said. ""We have CCTV footage which shows he himself tore his clothes,"" he said. Police also sought to know from Ingawale why he was wearing the official uniform while he was on leave, the officer said.

Pulwama attack fallout: Kashmiri students in Delhi fear for their security | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Several Kashmiri students here said they were in a state of fear after reports of alleged harassment of Kashmiris following the Pulwama terror attack, even as police asserted that security had been enhanced in the national capital and they would ensure the safety of all citizens. According to media reports, several Kashmiris living outside the state claimed they were harassed and attacked after the terrorist attack in Pulwama district in which 40 CRPF men were killed. A Kashmiri student from Jamia Millia Islamia, who did not wish to be identified, said, ""Just the fact that one is a Kashmiri, irrespective of his ideology or leanings, is enough to put one's life to risk. It is happening across the country. Kashmiri students are being harassed and hounded, be it Dehradun, Ambala or Bangalore. We really fear for our security here too."" JNU activist Shehla Rashid, who hails from Kashmir, said, ""Throughout India, mobs are attacking Kashmiri students, verbally abusing them, asking for them to be expelled and filing false cases against them. The pretext being given in each case is that they said Pakistan Zindabad and even police is buying into these false claims."" Noting that it was happening in other cities and it could happen in the national capital too, she said there was an intense sense of fear of mob lynching among students. Anis Ahmed, a Kashmiri student at Delhi University, said, ""We are not at all reacting on social media to any abuses which are being hurled at us even if we are being labelled as terrorists. Students who are staying on rented accommodations rather than hostels are even more scared about their safety"". Deputy Commissioner of Police Madhur Verma tweeted that security had been strengthened all across the national capital, including minority dominated areas. ""Visibility of police personnel has been increased. We'll ensure the safety and security of every citizen, including Kashmiri inhabitants and students living in Delhi,"" he said. Delhi minister Rajendra Pal Gautam also condemned the alleged attacks on Kashmiris. ""What kind of hatred and frenzy is being spread in the name of religion? The country has not even recovered from the Pulwama attack that reports of ill-treatment of Kashmiris have started pouring in,"" he tweeted. Gautam further said the perpetrators of these attacks were not patriots. The Home Ministry had on Saturday issued an advisory to all states and Union territories to take measures to ensure the safety and security of Kashmiris. The advisory came hours after Home Minister Rajnath Singh assured an all-party meeting of doing the needful for the protection of the Kashmiri students and people who were allegedly threatened after the terrorist attack. Some Kashmiri youths studying in Uttarakhand's Dehradun alleged that they were harassed and asked by their landlords to vacate accommodations fearing attacks on their properties in the aftermath of the attack.

 Pulwama attack: Suicide bomber arrived from bylane near Latoo mode of Awantipora | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Security forces investigating the terror attack that killed 40 CRPF men in Pulwama have revealed that the suicide bomber Aadil Dar came out from a by lane at Latoo mode of Awantipora on the National Highway and smashed into the fifth bus of the convoy as it was taking a turn at 3.15PM on Thursday. At least 70 people have been detained for questioning in the attack so far. A source said Dar, who was driving an SUV laden with explosives, overtook the first bus and then rammed into the left side of the fifth vehicle in the CRPF convoy, killing 40 men and injuring several others. According to one of the CRPF survivors of the terror attack, some youths pelted stones on the CRPF convoy barely 10 minutes before the explosive-laden vehicle rammed into the bus. Top CRPF officers, including director general R K Bhatnagar, visited the spot on Saturday to assess the situation. “The suicide bomber came closer to the CRPF bus, fifth in the row, on the left side and detonated the car,” a top CRPF officer told TOI. Talking to reporters at the spot, Bhatnagar said that it is still not clear what kind of explosives was used. “It will take some time to come up with the exact report about the vehicle used and the nature of explosives as well,” he said. A CRPF source, however, said initial reports suggest that apart from the RDX, Dar also used ammonium nitrate in the vehicle to inflict as much damage as possible. He added that the agency is trying to ascertain how the bomber managed to fit such a huge quantity of explosives in his vehicle. The convoy from Jammu plied only thrice in the last fortnight as snow had blocked the road and CRPF jawans were stranded in Jammu since February 4. “While 16 CRPF vehicles dropped out at Qazigund, the other part of the convoy left Qazigund at 2:38 pm to travel to Srinagar,” he added.

Latest intelligence inputs suggest that Ghazi alias Rasheed Afghani may have had a narrow escape during an encounter which took place days before the Thursday's deadly terror attack in Pulwama.

On January 3, TOI was the first to report about the top Jaish commander hiding in Pulwama after having crossed the border on December 9. The security forces have launched a massive manhunt for him after the Pulwama attack. As per information available with agencies, Ghazi is one of the closest and most trusted aides of Jaish chief Maulana Masood Azhar. He has been trained in warfare techniques and IED preparation by the Taliban and is known to be one of the finest hands of Jaish. “He returned to POK in 2011 after fighting the NATO forces in Federally Administered Tribal Area and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. Since then, he has been the most sought after jihadi trainer who specialises in Deeni and Askari (literature and weaponry) training in camps operated by Jaish and ISI across PoK,” a source said. Ghazi was sent to the Valley after security forced neutralised Masood Azhar’s nephew, Usman. Soon after his killing, JeM released a statement vowing to seek revenge. Azhar had already been seething for revenge after the   death of his first nephew Talha Rasheed   who was killed in 2017.

 Masood Azhar gave nod for Pulwama attack from Army base hospital in Pakistan | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar, also the mastermind of the Pathankot attack, gave instructions to his outfit members for the   suicide bombing on the CRPF convoy   in Pulwama from the Army base hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, where he is being treated for a terminal illness for the last four months.  His illness has ensured his absence in the last six key meetings of the United Jihad Council (UJC), the Pakistan-sponsored umbrella outfit of the jehadi groups it uses against India. However, eight days before his men prepared for Pulwama terror attack, Azhar released an audio message in a feeble voice to the terror outfit's members . In the audio message, Azhar can be heard asking his men to avenge the death of his nephew Usman, who was killed by security forces in October last year in Tral. ""There is nothing more pleasurable than death in this war,"" Azhar is heard saying in the tape. He keeps referring how he is braving the chill to egg on men to wage a war against India .  "" Koi inhe dashatganj kahega, koi inhe nikamma kahega, koi inhe pagal kahega, koi inhe aman ke liye khatra kaha ....(Some people will call these terrorists savages, insane or danger to peace but let them go and disrupt...across the border)"" he says.  Azhar did not share his plans for the latest attack with other constituents of the UJC. Instead Azhar secretly deputed his other nephew Mohammaed Umair and Abdul Rashid Ghazi to use these tapes to brainwash youth in the Valley and motivate them for a fidayeen attack with IED explosives.  ""None of the JeM men would come forward. They are all hiding in south Kashmir with three ring leaders - Umair, Ismail and Abdul Rashid Ghazi,"" said a top intelligence official in Kashmir.

Kashmir news: Pakistan shifts out terrorists from launch pads at LoC | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Perhaps   fearing surgical strikes   , Pakistan has relocated terrorists at launch pads along the Line of Control to army camps that are usually in close proximity to such facilities. With the Modi government stating that armed   forces have been authorised to respond to the Jaish-e-Muhammed   attack on the CRPF convoy, the Pakistan army seems to have taken some pre-emptive measures. Though there is tension on both sides, there is no artillery movement or any other deployment along the frontiers, top intelligence sources in Kashmir told TOI. “As of today, we don’t have any targets to strike at across the Line of Control, where terrorists used to be ready to be launched to infiltrate into this side,” sources said. This could leave the Indian Army with the option of targeting Pakistan army installations and could mean possible escalation of the conflict, a senior official said. Intelligence sources said the assessment that Pakistan was anticipating action- perhaps in response to terror attacks- was made by the fact that Pakistan did not vacate its winter posts along the frontiers this year. “At least 50 to 60 winter posts which would be vacated every year remain occupied as of now. With additional reinforcements from the terror launch pads, we don’t know what the strength of their posts is as of today,” sources said.

 Pulwama attack: China weighing options on Masood Azhar issue | India News - Times of India,"BEIJING: China appeared to be reviewing its stance on the issue of declaring Masood Azhar — head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) — a global terrorist, after the uproar in India over the   Pulwama killings.   While the Chinese foreign ministry has   condemned the attack   , there was no mention of Azhar in its statement. Beijing is weighing its options before taking a decision on the sensitive issue because it will upset its close ally, Pakistan. It had repeatedly helped Pakistan by blocking India’s efforts to   get Azhar listed by the UN Security Council as a global terrorist.  An indication of an internal review is available in the guarded message sent by Chinese State Councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, expressing his condolences for the death of the CRPF jawans. Another indication came from a statement put up in the website of the Chinese foreign ministry. China will participate in the UN Security Council discussions for listing Azhar as a global terrorist in “an objective, unbiased and professional manner,” the ministry said before delivering a crucial statement. “We will continue to do so and remain in communication with all parties including India on this issue,” it said. This suggested Beijing’s readiness to review the issue after further consultations with India. Experts say it is too early to expect China to reverse its existing stance without getting some advantage. “China might consider a change in its stance on Masood Azhar only after some hard bargaining. It will expect some concessions from India in return,” Phunchok Stobdan, former diplomat and strategic affairs expert told TOI. Stobdan said a lot depends on how well India is able to bargain on the issue instead of making public demands from China. Chinese leaders do not want to be seen as bowing to a public demand in India because that would hurt China’s image in Pakistan, he said. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Al Saud is scheduled to visit China on February 21-22 after travelling to Pakistan and India. Reports indicate he has cut short his visit to Pakistan by a day and has also cancelled a meeting of business delegations of the two countries, possibly due to the Pulwama attack. China, which hopes to develop a “strategic partnership” with Saudi Arabia, is expected to seriously weigh signals coming from the Crown Prince, as Saudi Arabia is apparently displeased by Pakistan’s attitude towards India. This may be another reason why Beijing might consider a change in its stance on Masood Azhar.

 US NSA backs India’s right to self-defence against attacks | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON/ NEW DELHI: The Trump administration on Friday virtually greenlighted punitive Indian measures against Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack, saying it “supported India’s right to self-defence against cross-border terrorism”. US national security adviser John Bolton spoke to Indian NSA Ajit Doval twice on phone following the attack to offer condolences and express support, using a phrase that reads like an open-ended term that allows New Delhi to fashion its answer to the Pakistani provocation. In a statement, Bolton has explicitly called on Pakistan to “crack down” on Jaish-e-Muhammed- the Pak-backed terror outfit that owned up the Pulwama attack- and all terrorists operating from its territory. Bolton said he expressed condolences to Doval for the “reprehensible terrorist attack on India” and added that all countries must uphold the UNSC responsibilities to deny safe haven and support for terrorists. A coordinated covert operation response, including drone strikes to take out UN-designated terrorists, has long been a desired objective in some quarters, but Washington has been reluctant to sign on to the idea, while signaling it will have no problem if India wants to take such measures. The US government’s support goes beyond endorsing India’s right to self-defence or retaliatory action, and extends to assistance at diplomatic and intelligence cooperation in the Pulwama terror case. The US has promised to work with India in removing obstacles in getting Jaish chief Maulana Masood Azhar sanctioned as a global terrorist by the UNSC. Azhar has escaped sanctions due to China’s persistent block in the council. The fairly unequivocal backing from the US at a time when India has been concerned about Pakistan’s role as a conduit for US in talks with Taliban is a boost for New Delhi’s campaign against Islamabad. It can further firm up India’s resolve for retaliatory action against Pakistan for the attack on CRPF troopers. Bolton not just supported, according to an Indian readout, India’s right to self-defence against cross-border terrorism but also promised to work with India in getting Azhar sanctioned by the UNSC. TOI had reported on Saturday that US will soon hold dialogue with India on terrorist designation with focus on Azhar. I expressed condolences to NSA Doval yesterday for the reprehensible terrorist attack on India. Pakistan must crack… https://t.co/6c9wyJhK2W— John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) 1550319120000The Indian release on the Bolton-Doval conversation said, “Ambassador Bolton supported India’s right to self-defence against crossborder terrorism. He offered all assistance to India to bring the perpetrators and backers of the attack promptly to justice.” The statement added that the “two NSAs vowed to work together to ensure that Pakistan ceases to be a safe haven for JeM and terrorist groups that target India, the US and others in the region”. The US response to Pakistan’s terrorist attacks has moved a long way from counselling restraint to both parties, which was the norm in the 1990s, to outright citing and condemnation of Pakistan and its terrorist policies, evident in Islamabad’s reluctance to roll up UN-designated terrorists such as Lashkar-e-Taiba’s Hafiz Saeed and JeM’s Masood Azhar. By continuing to allow the terrorists a free run in Pakistan, Islamabad is effectively in violation of its UN obligations, and Washington indicated it would also back any Indian move on the bureaucratic front to hold Pakistan to account before the international community. “They (the two NSAs) resolved to hold Pakistan to account for its obligations under UN resolutions and to remove all obstacles to designating JeM leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist under UN Security Council Resolution 1267 Committee process,” MEA statement said. Bolton, in fact, rewrote a milder State Department statement on the Pulwama attack. The NSA, a known hawk on security issues, held Pakistan responsible for the attack, overriding a state department call for “all countries” to uphold their responsibilities pursuant to the UN Security Council resolutions to deny safe haven and support for terrorists. The State Department subsequently echoed the White House’s tough stand, with secretary Micheal Pompeo, who had been travelling, tweeting: “We stand with #India as it confronts terrorism. Pakistan must not provide safe haven for terrorists to threaten international security.” The U.S. condemns yesterday’s horrific terror attack on Indian security forces.

"Pulwama terror attack:  Pulwama attack: Martyrs laid to rest, chants of 'we want revenge' reverberate | Madurai News - Times of India","TRICHY/ MADURAI: Amid a rising tide of emotions and chants of patriotic slogans, the mortal remains of slain CRPF soldiers C Sivachandran, 33, and G Subramanian, 28, who were killed in the terror attack in Pulwama, Kashmir, on Thursday, were laid to rest in their native villages in Ariyalur and Tuticorin districts.  The bodies of the two soldiers from Tamil Nadu were flown in by a special IAF aircraft from New Delhi along with those of two other fellow martyrs. Sivachandran's body was brought to the public space near the departure terminal of Trichy airport where his family members including brother-in-law V Arun and cousin K Jayabal received it. Subsequently, defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Union minister for skill development Anant Kumar Hegde, MPs P Kumar and T Rathinavel, and state ministers Vellamandi Natarajan and S Valarmathi offered floral tributes.  Members of the public including farmers and students who turned up in thousands to pay floral tributes carrying national flags raised patriotic slogans with chants of ""we want revenge"" and ""we want justice"" while the defence minister was paying homage. Later, the body was taken by road to his native Karkudi village in Ariyalur district where family members and locals were still in a state of shock as Sivachandran had left the hamlet after his vacation only a week ago. The defence minister consoled the martyr's pregnant wife Gandhimathi. After about two hours, the body was taken to Sivachandran's farmland at Karkudi where it was buried with a 21-gun salute from a team of paramilitary personnel.  Later, tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan handed over a cheque for 20 lakh from the state government to the family members.

 MEA mandarins brief envoys of many countries | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The government's campaign to isolate Pakistan saw the foreign ministry on Saturday reaching out to more resident envoys and explaining to them how Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed had carried out the Pulwama attack. The emphasis was on highlighting JeM's links with Pakistan and how even Pakistan's ministers have been spotted sharing the same podium with UN-proscribed terrorists like Hafiz Saeed.  Foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale and other MEA secretaries on Saturday briefed Asean ambassadors and also envoys of Gulf Cooperation Council countries. They also met envoys of many countries from Central Asia and Africa. ""FS and secretaries strongly rejected the denial by Pakistan of its involvement, highlighting the role of Pakistan in using terrorism as an instrument of its state policy,"" said an official source. Pakistan also briefed envoys in Islamabad claiming before them that India was only trying to divert attention from the ""gross human rights violations"" in Jammu and Kashmir. India rejected Pakistan's claims, saying there was a video of the suicide bomber declaring himself a member of the JeM and that there was even more, as it said in a statement, audio-visual and print material linking JeM to the terror attack. The fact that there has been no real condemnation of the terror attack by both Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, the understanding now in India is that a clueless civilian leadership in Islamabad is still struggling to put together a coherent response on the attack.  India is said to be considering several other diplomatic options against Pakistan, including postponing the March 14 Kartarpur meeting. However, there is an equally strong argument within the government that such a decision may prove counter-productive as it is certain to hurt the sentiments of Sikhs who are looking forward to the opening of the corridor later this year.

" At all-party meet, Farooq Abdullah demands security for J&amp;K students outside state | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The political class came together on Saturday to unanimously condemn Thursday's attack, blaming Pakistan without naming it for the outrage and expressing solidarity with security forces in the fight against terrorism. ""The entire nation speaks in one voice to express its determination to fight these challenges. Today, we stand united in solidarity with our security forces in fighting terrorism and in defending the unity and integrity of India,"" read the resolution adopted by an all-party meeting convened by home minister Rajnath Singh. Congress and other opposition parties demanded PM Narendra Modi call a meeting with leaders of all parties to discuss terrorism. The demand suggested that the opposition finds as “inadequate” a meeting of floor leaders chaired by Singh and wants the engagement to be scaled up. It is understood that some participants like Trinamool Congress felt unhappy that the draft of the resolution had been prepared beforehand. As they unanimously slammed the terror attack, BJP allies Akali Dal and Shiv Sena brought up references that could discomfit the government. Akali MP Prem Singh Chandumajra said the government should ensure that “a community” is not targeted like Sikhs were in 1984. He underlined the need to identify the specific perpetrators of the attack. Sena MP Sanjay Raut held up Indira Gandhi as an exemplar of decisive action. National Conference patriarch Farooq Abdullah asked the government to provide security to J&K students outside the state. He added steps be taken to ensure there is no communal flare-up in the state. At this point, home minister Singh said advisories have been issued to states to ensure peace and deal firmly with miscreants. The demand for a meeting with the PM was raised by Congress representatives Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Jyotiraditya Scindia and K C Venugopal, and found support from other parties, including Trinamool Congress’s Derek O’Brien and CPI’s D Raja. The resolution blamed “forces across the border” for the terror attack, in what was a clear allusion to Pakistan. “We condemn terrorism and the support being given to it from across the border,” it said. Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut brought up Indira Gandhi as the inspiration in delivering a response to Pakistan, in what was a reference to 1971. He urged that the country move strategically in its response. Later, he said that Pulwama would not have happened if surgical strikes carried out post-Uri had an impact on Pakistan.

 Pakistan links Pulwama attack to upcoming Lok Sabha election | India News - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: With tensions running high between India and Pakistan following this week’s terrorist attack in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, Islamabad responded with its own narrative and denied any role in the deadly incident. Instead, it linked the murderous attack to the upcoming parliamentary elections in India. In a complete mode of denial against any fact linking the attack to Pakistan, authorities here described Indian government and media’s reaction as irresponsible, baseless, immature and an attempt to twist the upcoming polls in India for political gains. Islamabad also condemned New Delhi for levelling allegations against it before probing the incident and suggested to look inward before blaming Pakistan. If, according to top Pakistani officials, India has any evidence, it should share and Pakistan will carry out investigation. Pakistan has always reacted in similar manner to all terror incidents that had occurred across the border in the past. “New Delhi needs to explain whether it desired peace and stability in the region or political point-scoring with attention on the upcoming elections,” asked Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi while speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. “Accusing Pakistan is very easy, you pass the buck,” Qureshi remarked. “Pakistan has been very clear, our viewpoint is clear, and, specifically, the stance of this government has been plain and simple: we desire peace,” he said. The foreign minister said India should have acted more responsibly and engaged themselves with Pakistan by sharing evidence. “Now, I’m a bit sad that India did not even complete a probe into the incident, there was no investigation, yet there was a knee-jerk -- an immediate -- reaction, wherein they levelled accusations against Pakistan,” he said. “There are many voices, even within India, who want the government to oversee their counterproductive actions, that is, the atrocities and human rights violations,” the minister added. Talking in a TV programme on Geo News, information minister Fawad Chaudhry said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the primary beneficiary of the Pulwama attack. “The attack took place 130km inside India, the car was obviously not transported from Pakistan and neither was the 360kg of explosive material used in the attack. The attackers were also locals,” Chaudhry said, adding, “There is a trend in India that instead of looking inwards, it blames Pakistan.” “We also need to consider who benefited more from it. Apparently, it seems that Modi, who is contesting elections and appears to be losing, has benefited from it. He seems desperate to create a conflict,” the information minister said. He added that whenever things start improving in Pakistan, attempts are made to create challenges for it and this latest attack seems to be one such conspiracy.

India raises customs duty on goods imported from Pakistan to 200% - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The government said on Saturday that it had raised customs duty on all products imported from Pakistan to 200%, a stern warning to the neighbour in the wake of the deadly terror attack in Kashmir which killed 40 securitymen on Thursday. The move comes a day after India withdrew the most-favoured nation (MFN) status to Pakistan. India had granted MFN status to Pakistan in 1996 but Islamabad has refused to reciprocate. ""India has withdrawn the MFN status to Pakistan after the Pulwama incident. Upon withdrawal, basic customs duty on all goods exported from Pakistan to India has been raised to 200% with immediate effect,"" Union finance minister Arun Jaitey said on micro blogging platform Twitter.  Sources said the decision was taken on Saturday afternoon and is being seen as a strong message that India does not wish to have trade links with Pakistan. It is also being seen as a measure to isolate the neighbour and pile pressure on Islamabad to act against terrorists operating from its soil. The government issued a notification later in the evening announcing the increase in the duty. livebudget updatesmoreupdates""Whereas the central government is satisfied that the import duty leviable on all goods originating in or exported from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, falling under the first schedule to the customs tariff act 1975 (51 of 1975), should be increased and that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action,"" said the notification announcing the increase in duties. Grant of MFN status is meant to ensure that a WTO member does not discriminate between trading partners. While the overall trade volume may have been less than $2.5 billion last year, a far larger chunk of the shipments are routed via third countries such as UAE and Singapore. Trade experts said the move to raise customs duty on imports from Pakistan will serve to send a strong message to Islamabad. ""We don't import much from Pakistan but this decision is a tough message that we don't want to trade with them, "" said Biswajit Dhar, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.  The government's decision to withdraw the MFN status to Pakistan is unlikely to significantly impact the low trade volume between the two neighbours but is meant to squeeze the country already battling a severe economic crisis.

Unable to understand the gravity of the situation, Tilak's 3-year-old son broodingly played as his father's remains were taken for the cremation. It was a poignant moment when Savitri took off her red and gold dupatta and covered the coffin with it. At Shikar village in Odisha's Jagatsinghpur, there were not many eyes that remained dry as Mina, the widow of Prasanna Sahoo, crumpled to the floor when a police band sounded the bugle to mark the start of the last journey of her husband from their house to the crematorium. The funeral was attended by state officials, police and CRPF representatives. Shops and other establishments in Shikar and nearby areas were closed and locals lined both sides of the road to pay their last respects.  Hundreds of miles away, a pall of gloom descended on the 4th battalion of CRPF stationed in Rayagada district, where Sahoo was posted for anti-Maoist operations between 2013 and 2017 . In Jharkhand, Vijay Soreng was cremated in the presence of thousands of mourners and family members at his native Farsama Kumhari village in Gumla district on Saturday. Soreng's eldest son Arun performed the last rites while his youngest son, 10-year-old Rahul, vowed to become a soldier and avenge his father's killing. His daughters Rekha (17) and Barkha (12) were inconsolable while Soreng's second wife, Vimla, expressed her need to be employed to support her family.

"Pulwama attack: My statement was distorted, says Sidhu | Ludhiana News - Times of India","LUDHIANA: After getting trolled on social media for his statement regarding the role of Pakistan in backing Pulwama terror attack on CRPF men on Thursday, local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu clarified, “The terror attack is always condemnable and bad people should be punished. Nation always comes first for me before anything else.” He said for the misdeeds of a few bad people, entire nation cannot be held guilty. The minister says Pulwama terror attack should not leave any impact on decision taken regarding Kartarpur corridor. The cricketer-turned-politician was here in city on Saturday for announcing multiple development works for the city. While addressing the press conference, Sidhu said, “Whatever I said on Friday was distorted and instead of showing complete statement only a few lines were picked up. I do not know why it happens all the time; may be some people feel insecure.” Sidhu said that terrorism has no religion, caste or creed and it should be wiped out completely, because country cannot let brave soldiers die like this in future. “When a politician comes anywhere, security arrangements are provided, but when these 3,000 CRPF men were passing, why were no trackers used and for how long will we let our brave soldiers die like this? There is need to check all these things,” he said. Regarding Kartarpur corridor he said, “Due to these bad people, the sentiments of several devotees attached with Kartarpur Corridor should not be ignored and this attack should not change the decision taken by prime ministers of two neighbouring countries, because it will fulfill the desire of those bad people to keep two countries under terror. The cabinet minister, while answering a query regarding his Pakistan visit and hug to the Pakistan army chief, said, “I had gone there as a friend and moreover I was invited there, but Indian PM went there uninvited and after PM Narendra Modi’s visit, India witnessed Pathankot attack and even when former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee went to Pakistan, Kargil happened.” But when he went to Pakistan, he brought good news regarding Kartarpur Corridor and people who were laughing at him earlier then went there to attend the ceremony, he said, adding that the only solution to end terrorism is to create international pressure and stop funding the terrorist groups. Sidhu affirmed that he never backed terrorism, but due to a few bad people, country’s progress cannot be affected. “If a snake bites anybody, then its antidote is also snake bite,” he added. Earlier, on Friday while reacting on Pulwama attack, the minister had stated that for a few people entire nation or one person cannot be condemned.

White House greenlights punitive Indian measures against Pakistan - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Friday virtually greenlighted punitive Indian measures against Pakistan for the Pulwama terrorist attack, saying it ""supported India's right to self-defence against cross-border terrorism"". US National Security Advisor John Bolton spoke to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval twice on phone following the attack to offer condolences and expressed support for an Indian response in ""self-defence"", an open-ended term that allows New Delhi to fashion its own answer to Pakistani provocation. ""Ambassador Bolton supported India's right to self-defence against cross-border terrorism. He offered all assistance to India to bring the perpetrators and backers of the attack promptly to justice,"" India's external affairs ministry confirmed in a statement, after Bolton had first disclosed in Washington his conversation with Doval to PTI. The statement added that the ""two NSAs vowed to work together to ensure that Pakistan ceases to be a safe haven for JeM and terrorist groups that target India, the US and others in the region"". A coordinated covert operation response, including drone strikes to take out UN-designated terrorists, has long been the desired objective in some quarters, but Washington has been reluctant to sign on to the idea, while signaling that it will have no problem if India wants to undertake such measures. The US response to Pakistan's terrorist attacks has moved a long way from counselling restraint to both parties, which was the norm going back to the 1990s, to outright citing and condemnation of Pakistan and its terrorist policies, evident in Islamabad's reluctance to roll up UN-designated terrorist such as Lashkar-e-Taiba's Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-e-Mohammed's Masood Azhar. By continuing to allow the terrorists a free run in Pakistan, Islamabad is effectively in violation of its UN obligations, and Washington indicated it would also back any Indian move on the bureaucratic front to hold Pakistan to account before the international community. Only China among major countries continues to provide cover to Pakistan's use of terror and to its terrorists. ""They (the two NSAs) resolved to hold Pakistan to account for its obligations under UN resolutions and to remove all obstacles to designating JeM leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 Committee process,"" the MEA statement said. Bolton in fact rewrote a milder State Department statement on the Pulwama attack put together by lower ranking officials in the absence of secretary of state Mike Pompeo who was traveling. The National Security Advisor, a known hawk on security issues, explicitly held Pakistan responsible for the attack, overriding a state department call for ""all countries"" to uphold their responsibilities pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions to deny safe haven and support for terrorists. The State Department subsequently fell in line with the White House's tough stand, with Pompeo, on his return, tweeting ""We stand with #India as it confronts terrorism. Pakistan must not provide safe haven for terrorists to threaten international security."" In Pakistan though, denial continued to be norm with the country's finance minister Asad Umar rejecting allegations that Jaish-e-Mohammed was sponsored by Pakistan. The fact that UN-designated terrorists and jihadi terror groups have a free run in the country - a fact extensively chronicled in the media - does not appear to embarrass or faze Pakistan's leadership. Umar also maintained the economy wouldn't be affected by India withdrawing the Most Favored Nation trade status to Pakistan following the Pulwama attack even though the country has gone down the tubes because of global opprobrium and its finances are shored up begging bowl trips to a handful of patrons such as Saudi Arabia and China.

 Opposition leaders surprised by govt's draft resolution before deliberations on Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India,"New Delhi: Many among the Opposition party leaders present at the all party meeting called by the government on Saturday were “taken by surprise” that the government was ready with a draft resolution even before deliberations started on the issue of Pulwama terror attack. In fact, an attending member told TOI, “the government was trying to get a lever for any future action which was not allowed by changing the last paragraph of the resolution... it could have skipped (our) notice if it was simply read out and passed by a voice vote.” Trinamool Congress was one of the most vociferous among those demanding a “written copy of the draft” that the meeting — chaired by home minister Rajnath Singh— proposed to pass only by “reading out” to the senior members attending it. Congress and CPI leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and D Raja respectively were also among those who wanted a copy of the resolution before it was passed. On the insistence of the TMC members Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O’Brien, the government finally gave them the only other written copy apart from the one that the home minister had. The last paragraph originally read: “Today we all resolve to stand with our security forces and efforts of the Central and State government to ensure that these challenges are suitably and firmly responded to.” This was changed to: “Today we stand united in solidarity with our security forces and defend the unity and integrity of India.” The revised version was written out by a TMC MP and the final resolution included it as it was accepted by all the attending parties including Congress. The Left parties had asked for the word “communal harmony” to be included, it is learnt, in the resolution but it was rejected. With Congress bringing up the issue of a meeting of all the presidents or leaders of the political parties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the earliest, TMC, Left, SP and almost all other parties supported it.

 Pulwama attack: Terror financing watchdog FATF to be given dossier to blacklist Pakistan for terror links | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A dossier, nailing the culpability of Pakistan in the terror attack in Pulwama, will be given to the FATF, an international terror financing watchdog, to expose the neighbouring country's links with terrorism and seeking its blacklisting, officials said on Saturday. Security agencies are preparing the dossier with the evidence gathered so far related to the attack carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad and the help being provided to the outfit by the country, they said. This will be a dossier on Pakistani agencies' links with the JeM and how the terror group is being aided by them, a security official said. The details of the terror attacks carried out by the JeM in the past will be mentioned in the document. The Paris-headquartered Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will also be told through the dossier how the Pakistani agencies are providing funds to the JeM, the official said. In the next meeting of the FATF, India will also press for the blacklisting of Pakistan so that action can be taken against the country, another official said. The FATF plenary and working group meetings will be held in Paris next week. The FATF blacklist means the country concerned is ""non-cooperative"" in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. If the FATF blacklists Pakistan, it may lead to downgrading of the country by multilateral lenders like IMF, World Bank, ADB, EU and also a reduction in risk rating by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Pakistan has been put on the grey list of the anti-terror finance watchdog in July 2018. The FATF currently has 35 members and two regional organisations – European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council. North Korea and Iran are in the FATF blacklist.

Kashmir news: New threat in Jammu &amp; Kashmir: Homegrown suicide bomber &amp; vehicle-borne IEDs | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The advent of the local ‘suicide bomber’ and return of vehicle-borne IEDs in J&K are the two new concerns for the security establishment after Thursday’s strike on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama.  According to a former J&K DGP, Kashmiri Muslims traditionally did not become suicide bombers. “Their religious orientation is different. There are two lines of thought in Islam. The first is that committing suicide is ‘haraam’, and it is this line Kashmiris have always subscribed to. As per the second line of thought that first emerged West Asia, suicide committed in furtherance of jihad is not ‘haraam’ as the suicide attacker is a soldier of Islam,” he said. “This ideology later spread to Syria, followed by Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, if the same ideology gains ground among Kashmiris, it is a matter of concern. This means the person who motivated the Pulwama attacker to turn suicide bomber can do the same to other vulnerable Kashmiri youth,” the officer added. Though the Badamibagh cantonment attack of 2000 involved a 17-year-old Kashmiri blowing up an explosive-laden vehicle, it was technically not a suicide attack. The boy, a former IPS officer said, was only meant to park the explosives-laden car in the complex. However, when his car was being checked at the gate, he panicked and tried to get out. At this point, his handler, watching from a distance, triggered the car bomb remotely.  Vehicle-borne IED attacks, also reported in 2005, were discontinued thereafter. Hizbul Mujahideen, too, has avoided using IEDs as they cause civilian casualties. “The suicide bomber mode is favoured by JeM as the group is focused on carrying out high-impact terror strikes. However, considering Kashmiris believe suicide is ‘haraam’, Jaish would use foreign fighters who were sent across from Pakistan on the eve of the fidayeen attack,” said an officer. “Prior to the Pulwama attack, every suicide bombing, be it 2001 J&K assembly car bombing or attacks on camps in Pathankot, Nagrota and Uri, was carried out by Pakistani cadres. The local Kashmiri operatives’ role was restricted to providing logistics, transportation,” another functionary said.  “If Jaish is now able to get Kashmiris for such tasks, there is a clear risk of other locals getting brainwashed, helping Pakistan’s attempts to project terror in J&K as homegrown,” the officer added.  “It is a fact that radicalisation has significantly increased among Kashmiri youths in the past few years but if it has reached a level that Kashmiri boys have been brainwashed to blow themselves up, then we need a whole new strategy,” said a senior counterterrorism official, requesting anonymity. Sources said that though there was no excuse for the intel failure in Pulwama, unless the intelligence agencies were free from political dominance and their sleeper cells made “so powerful” that they could assassinate terrorist leaders like Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed and Syed Salahuddin inside Pakistan on the lines of Israeli defence forces, these type of incidents would continue to haunt the forces.

He was in fact clearing the way for the convoy to pass,” Raturi said. A resident of Chinyalisaur in Uttarkashi district, Raturi had moved to Dehradun over a decade back. Neighbours said they heard Raturi’s widow Sareeta and children wailing. “We were aware of the news but did not want to disturb the family immediately,” said a neighbour. Raturi was father to five children. While the eldest daughter is married to Nautiyal, none of the other children are of working age.

What is peace if people are still dying?” he said. CRPF deputy inspector general Dinesh Uniyal, who also visited Raturi's family here said that the body will be brought to the state capital by Friday evening.

Rana, son of a retired BSF subedar, was one of the four children of Deewan Singh, a retired subedar of Border Security Force. Rana was father of two, a five-year-old girl and a two-year-old boy. “He had left for Jammu and Kashmir on Monday after spending twenty days of leave with the family,” said his elder brother, Jayram Singh Rana. Deewan Singh, father of the slain jawan said, “Our soldiers are killed on a regular basis by Pakistan-sponsored terror groups, but nothing has been done. The Indian government should respond with full force.” “The government should stop hollow talk and take direct action against Pakistan. We want revenge at any cost,” said Renu Rana, widow of the jawan. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

Pulwama attack: ‘Papa said he would come back soon’ | Udaipur News - Times of India,"UDAIPUR: Binol, a nondescript village nestled in a remote area in Kunwariya block of Rajsamand district, has been witnessing incessant arrival of visitors since the past 24 hours. Party leaders, relatives, administrative officers have been dropping in, at martyr Narayan Lal Gurjar’s home to express grief and extend support to his family. His martyrdom has come as a big shock for many people in the area who had recently seen the soldier as his jolly self, actively participating in the village temple restoration event early this week. Narayan Lal had come for a week’s leave to Binol and had returned on Tuesday. Until late, Narayan Lal’s name had been in the list of missing soldiers and his family members kept praying for his safety. But all their hopes of seeing him safe and alive were dashed when the confirmation of his martyrdom came. “The martyr’s mortal remains are awaited at his native place and may arrive in a day or two. Proper arrangements would be made as per the protocol,” additional SP Rajesh Bharadwaj told TOI. “Papa said he would come back soon when I spoke to him last on Wednesday, but now I know he won’t come back. We hate the people who killed him and so many brave soldiers like him. Papa always told us about soldiers’ sacrifice for the nation but we have realized it today,” Hemlata, the martyr’s 14-year-old daughter said sobbing. “He was the sole bread winner of the family and was very hard-working. He had served for some 16 years in CRPF with major postings in the disturbed Kashmir area. In his absence, his wife Mohini fulfilled the household responsibilities as his children are still in school. He often narrated the hardships of a soldier's life but said that the suffering is worth it for the motherland. He inspired youths to join armed forces and always said that ‘Jawan ya kisaan hi sacchi desh seva kartey hain (It’s the soldiers and farmers who truly serve the nation)’. Youths who aspired to join the army sought his guidance,” said Gopal Singh, a close of aide of his. “Narayan Lal nurtured patriotic zeal since his childhood days. He was very good in studies, as well as in sports, and always wanted to join the armed forces. His name is engraved on the board in the government senior secondary school of our village, which he proudly showed to kids in the area and advised them to study harder,” Bhanwarlal Gurjar, the martyr’s cousin said.

Pulwama attack:‘Losing mother early changed his thinking’ | Jaipur News - Times of India,"ALWAR: Martyred jawan Bhagirathi Singh wanted to lead a more purposeful life, away from the notorious ravines of Chambal and its dreaded dacoits and the mining mafia in and around Dholpur. He joined CRPF in 2013. His village Jaitpur has 35 houses with a population of about 150. The locals said for any unemployed youth, getting drawn into illegal mining is an easy option. But Bhagirathi, from the very young age, decided that he would not follow suit. After turning 21, he got the opportunity to serve in the paramilitary forces. Having lost his mother when he was a toddler, Singh also motivated his younger brother, who is now serving in Uttar Pradesh police. “Bhagirathi was very different from the men here. He was absolutely certain that he has to make something of his life and definitely not to get into anything illegal. I still remember that whenever he would see any vehicle loaded with material from the mines, he would stop and question them. He had made it a mission to educate the youth in Jaitpur to not follow the path of crime,” said his uncle Bhagwati Prasad. Bhagirathi was on around one month’s leave before going back to Jammu on February 11. “As usual, this time also he got a group of 15-20 boys and talked to them about joining the forces. He told them that the ways of the past are long gone, and they can actually get arrested if they get into illegal mining,” said Prasad. When news of his death reached home, his wife collapsed and the entire village is feel devastated now, added Prasad. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Pulwama attack: Revoking MFN status insufficient step | Amritsar News - Times of India,"AMRITSAR: The business community here has welcomed the revoking of the ‘most favoured nation’ (MFN) status given to Pakistan, but at the same time they have demanded that the cross-border barter trade being carried out from Jammu and Kashmir should be stopped immediately. “The barter trade routes operating between Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (POK) should immediately be stopped, as they are a threat to the nation. Barter trade is also the biggest source of funding to terrorists which has been acknowledged by the National Investigation Agency (NIA),” said Suneet Kochhar, chairman of Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ASSOCHAM), Punjab chapter. While talking to TOI on Friday, he said that trading with Pakistan was possible if there were cordial relations between the two countries, but it was not so. “In the current situation, snapping business ties with Pakistan will not hurt India’s interest,” he said. Echoing him, Anil Mehra, president of Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Commercial Association, said that not only the barter trade from Jammu and Kashmri should be stopped, but even trade with Pakistan from integrated check post (ICP) at Attari should be banned unless Pakistan assures to “tame the militants operating from its soil”. “Revoking MFN status is too little a step,” he added. “National interest is bigger than business interest. We can’t do business with Pakistan at the cost of our jawans,” said Mehra, who too has business interest across the border. The Centre had allowed trading of specific items of Kashmiri origin under the barter system in Jammu and Kashmir but, according to sources, almost everything was being traded from across LoC, using fake certificates of origins of goods. President of Indo-Foreign Chamber of Commerce B K Bajaj said, “It is an insufficient step against Pakistan.” He said that traders would keep their markets closed on Saturday to protest against Pulwama terrorist attack.

Pulwama attack: ‘Emotionally-charged’ Captain calls for befitting response to Pakistan | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: While calling for a “befitting response” to the attack by Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh warned Pakistan army and prime minister against indulging in any such activities in Punjab. The Punjab assembly on Friday passed a unanimous resolution condemning the attack. The chief minister, who got emotional while moving the resolution seeking an adjournment of the ongoing budget session as a mark of respect to the jawans martyred in the attack, sought retaliation from the Central government against Pakistan, which he said had been supporting terror activities in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. Holding Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa and Prime Minister Imran Khan responsible for the attack, Capt Amarinder said that things were getting out of control and time for the talks with Pakistan was over. “Enough is enough. Over 40 young men were killed. What was their fault?” questioned the CM. Capt also pointed out that Punjab had suffered terrorism in the ’80s and the ’90s and fought it with a strong police force, which had grown manifold. “We have a fully-equipped force of 81,000 motivated men, who have passed the test of fire,” said the chief minister, declaring that if Bajwa and ISI tried anything in Punjab they would get a resounding response. The house erupted in loud roar, with members across party lines thumping tables. The CM accused Imran Khan of playing a double game by promoting anti-Indian forces on the one hand and talking of starting a university in the name of Sri Guru Nanak Dev. He had been made the prime minister by ISI and he’s completely at their service, said Captain Amarinder. He said that Referendum 2020 of SJF, which was a ISI’s sponsored activity, was also a sign of their continued attempts to disturb peace in Punjab. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) member Bikram Singh Majithia lauded the chief minister for his address and said that he spoken like a soldier and a true Indian. Dubbing Imran Khan as an ISI puppet, he said the attack had exposed their double standards. Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema sought Rs 1 crore compensation and jobs for the kin of the four deceased victims from Punjab. Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal also condemned the attack and urged the state government to adopt the family of four martyrs and give them substantial financial help.

Pulwama news: Response to Pulwama attack: Precision air strikes the favoured option | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The armed forces have stepped up military pressure along the volatile Line of Control in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack, with Pakistan army too raising its alert levels, but the dominant feeling is that the government needs to seriously consider options for limited cross-border strikes to compel Islamabad to change its behaviour. The military options, short of going to war, could range from 'shallow' ground-based attacks and occupation of some heights along the LoC to restricted but precision air strikes against 'non-state targets' in PoK, senior military officers said. There is growing agreement in the security establishment that carefully-calibrated airborne strikes are among the most viable and effective options to teach a lesson to Pakistan, with the ground-based 'surgical strikes' of September 2016 having somewhat lost their element of surprise. He was on phone when blast took place: Slain jawan's wifeFighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs, Mirage-2000s and Jaguars, armed with 'smart' glide bombs and missiles, can be used to take out some terror camps and launch pads near the LoC from 'stand-off ranges' without even crossing into Pakistani airspace. ""Preparation time for such air strikes is minimal,"" said an officer on the condition of anonymity. Then, the 90-km Smerch multiple-launch rocket systems and the 290-km BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles can be used to target Pakistani army posts, terror camps, launch pads and staging areas. Army to decide time, place of response: PM Modi on Pulwama attacksBut exercising any such coercive option will require political will to risk retaliation and escalation, with Pakistan clearly being no military pushover. “There are a host of military options available depending on the time, place and kind of weapon system to be used without crossing the threshold. The aim would be to target the terror infrastructure in PoK, not the Pakistan heartland or its citizens,” said another officer. Officers contend the use of hard military options against terror-training camps, even though many of them may be makeshift, will send an unequivocal message to Pakistan, and is a risk worth taking because the diplomatic offensive against Pakistan has failed to deliver the goods. “Pulwama is a big tragedy. But it was coming, and Pakistan’s hand is all over it. How long will we continue to take hits? We have to seriously start looking at some hard-kinetic options,” said Lt Gen D S Hooda (retd), who oversaw the “surgical strikes” in 2016 as the Northern Command chief. PM Modi pays tribute to martyred CRPF personnel“Diplomacy with Pakistan is not working, with China backing it to the hilt. One surgical strike in three years is not going to change Pakistan’s attitude… India needs a consistent, long-term strategy, with options in the military sphere not being ruled out,” he added. But some in the security establishment also struck a word of caution. The use of any air or missile strike on Pakistani territory, backed as it will have to be with troop mobilisation on the ground, is bound to be escalatory as well as lead to collateral damage in the absence of hard intelligence and target coordinates. “Virtually the entire air defence machinery of Pakistan is geared towards India. Things can easily spin out of control. Does India want a full-blown war with Pakistan, which has often threatened first use of nuclear weapons?” asked an officer.

A last selfie and call to check on son’s health | Nagpur News - Times of India,"NAGPUR: Nitin Rathore stands by a snow-clad road with a series of sky blue CRPF buses in the background. Perhaps it was the last picture of happy-go-lucky Rathore from Chorpangra village of Buldhana district. The picture, that was shared by the soldier’s family living in Buldhana on TOI’s request, was clicked by him just before beginning the fateful journey on Friday. The buses in the background were of the same convoy which was targeted by suicide bomber killing over 40. Rathore loved the sights and scenes of Kashmir and used to keep sending the pictures, said his kin. “It was the same convoy which was ambushed. Rathore, who always liked to capture the beauty of Kashmir Valley, may have found just one more opportunity to have another selfie,” said his colleague Gaurav Lahane. He had sent the picture to his wife on a social media platform, said another friend. Lahane was attending the phone calls on Rathore’s wife’s mobile after the incident. Lahane, who lives in the neighbouring village had come home on leave a week ago, and Rathore had left to join his unit before a couple of days. “We were in the same unit. Rathore leaves behind wife, Vandana, two children — Prachi and Piyush, who are eight and 10 years old, apart from aged parents. There is one more person from the village in the CRPF,” he said, adding his relatives are in a state of shock and would not talk. Rathore was among the two from Vidarbha who were killed in Pulwama blast. The 36-year-old Rathore had put in 15 years of service and Lahane was his junior. The other CRPF personnel who was killed in the attack Sanjay Rajput, 45, was also from Buldhana district. A native of Malkapur town of the district, his wife and children stayed at the quarters in CRPF’s Group Centre in Nagpur. “It’s Quarter Number 219, you ask anyone,” said the guard without asking much questions after having a glance at this reporter’s identity card. Less than 500 metres away inside a lane flanked by three-storeyed residential blocks with peeling paint, Rajput’s house could be easily identified by the crowd of visitors. “Don’t go upstairs, you can talk to his brother here itself,” politely said a female CRPF constable seated outside the apartment, as neighbours thronged at the third floor house where Rajput’s wife and children stay. Rajput was posted to Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) just a week ago. He had left Nagpur on February 12. A few hours before the blast, he had called up wife Sushma to inquire about his 10-year-old son Jay’s health. The child had caught fever when Rajput had left home to resume the new charge at Srinagar. “He was posted at 213 Regiment at Nagpur, but had got the orders to join the 115 Battalion in J&K. After putting in 20 years of service, he had reached the rank of havaldar,” said his brother-in-law Rahul Gahalwar. A little ahead, Rajput’s brother Rajesh, who works in a state government agency at Buldhana, was preparing for the family’s travel to Buldhana. The womenfolk were planning to leave before the body arrived by air on Saturday morning. “He had finished 20 years of service, which is a pensionable tenure, but he chose to continue,” said the brother.

"Pulwama attack: Parties slam attack on CRPF convoy, seek action | Aurangabad News - Times of India","AURANGABAD: Different political parties on Friday staged demonstrations against the Pulwama suicide attack on CRPF convoy that left 44 jawans dead and many injured. Speaking to reporters at Shahganj, MIM MLA Imtiyaz Jaleel said that the Union government should give a betting reply to Pakistan, holding that country responsible for the suicide attack. ""It was an unprecedented and biggest attack in the last 30 years. Enough is enough. Pakistan must be taught a lesson. We should not tolerate such cowardly attacks anymore,'' he said while leading a demonstration at Shahganj where the party workers and residents gathered to pay homage to the CRPF jawans by observing a two-minute silence. Congress leader Jitendra Dehade asked as to how far the terrorists were being allowed to indulge in such cowardly acts time and again. He alleged that it was due to the intelligence failure that the terrorists could attack the convoy in Pulwama of Jammu & Kashmir. Shiv Sena leaders, including district president Ambadas Danve, mayor Nandu Ghodele and former MP Pradeep Jaiswal led a demonstration at Kranti Chowk. The party workers burnt the flag of Pakistan and stomped on that country's map to express their anger. The Sena workers shouted slogans against Pakistan and demanded that the Union government retaliate in a befitting manner. They regretted that during the Modi regime, many jawans lost their lives compared to the previous regime. The Sena leaders demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi get tough and initiate immediate action against the terrorists and Pakistan which is supporting them.

We have been married for just 17 months,” said Krishnaveni, widow of CRPF jawan Subramaniam who was among the personnel killed in Thursday’s suicide attack in Pulwama, Kashmir. Savalapperi village near Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district, where the 28-year-old jawan hails from, is in mourning since Friday morning as messages of the death were circulated on social media. Until afternoon the family was in denial mode. “We still believe he is alive,” his father V Ganapathi told TOI over the phone. “That (he died) is what they (fellow villagers) are telling me. But if it is true we would have first got the information from the CRPF. At one point the family got annoyed when journalists swarmed the house. Meanwhile, the family got worried when Subramaniam could not be reached over the phone. “The auto recorded voice said the phone is switched off,” Krishnaveni told reporters in the afternoon. Their worst fears were confirmed when police and revenue officials shared the chief minister’s condolence message and announcement of Rs 20 lakh solatium to the family. Subramanian was the youngest of four children of Ganapathi, a farmer, and Maruthammal. “From a very young age it was his desire to join the police, army or any other uniformed service and serve the country,” Ganapathi said. After schooling and completing ITI training he attended the section camp and joined the CRPF five years ago. He started his career in the force at Uttar Pradesh and has served in Chennai and Kashmir. About 18 months ago Subramanian married Krishnaveni. While she stayed with his parents, he used to visit the family every few months. He had come during Pongal and was home till February 10. During that period, he got his father admitted in a hospital in Tirunelveli for an eye surgery. In his father’s absence Subramanian looked after the farm. Villagers said he was soft spoken and patriotic. He used to motivate youth of his village to join the armed forces and serve the nation. They recalled that during his last visit, he united two groups of tussling youths and gave an elaborate speech on staying united. “If you don’t stay together, how will the nation be united?” they quoted him telling the youth. After he returned to duty, he was constantly in touch with the family over the phone. Krishnaveni said their last conversation was around 2 pm on Thursday, shortly before the suicide attack blew his convoy to pieces. “He said that he was on his way to deployment. I asked him if he had eaten, to which he said they had packed their food and would eat once they reach their destination. He said he would call me after reaching the destination,” she said. Susheela his elementary school teacher said Subramanian was a very active boy. “Even after so many years later, he would always greet me and talk respectfully,” she said. Students of the school paid a silent tribute to the fallen soldier. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Financial needs make many jawans continue beyond pensionable service | Nagpur News - Times of India,"NAGPUR: “My husband too had left for Srinagar with Rajput, but was posted at a different place and is safe,” said one of the women gathered below Sanjay Rajput’s apartment at CRPF Group centre (GC) in Hingna. CRPF has GCs at Nagpur and Pune in the state. Personnel posted at conflict areas including neighbouring Gadchiroli can leave their families at the quarters here, if their previous tenure was at the centre. Of the 500 families living at Hingna centre, men in almost 400 homes are posted at such places, said a senior officer. “My husband also left for J&K two days ago, soon after the news was out, he called us. We spend sleepless nights. Each one of us tunes in to the TV time to time hoping there is no bad news in store,” said Vidya Khade. “My husband Samba Ingole is in the same area,” added Varshatai. The family is from Pusad in Yavatmal. Like Rajput, husbands of many of the women there, had completed 20 years in CRPF but had continued their service. Twenty years of service makes the personnel eligible for retirement and pension but a majority of them choose to continue. “It is difficult to carry out children’s education if you retire. The pension is from Rs18,000 to Rs25000 for personnel of lower cadre. So they prefer to continue. At least it secures children’s future,” was the common answer of many women, as they talked about hardships faced by a soldier’s family. “Husbands of many of us are in their mid-40s. One needs to have good means like agriculture land or other sources to be able to retire. Otherwise they just continue so kids’ education is completed,” added another whose husband was also posted in a conflict zone. “Mine is in Sukma, Chhattisgarh, since last two years, I tune in to Chhattisgarh channel on the cable network to keep tab on developments,” said a wife. Some, whose husbands were in Gadhciroli, said they were a little fortunate as their men could visit them frequently at Nagpur. “I will complete pensionable service in three years, but I plan to continue, though there are no financial compulsions. I have adjusted to the life here and would like to serve more,” said Rajput’s colleague remembering the late colleague as one who had guided him in administrative procedures.

 Indian envoy to Pakistan arrives in Delhi for consultations on Pulwama terror attack | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria arrived on Saturday for consultations with senior officials and leadership over the Pulwama terror attack, sources said. The Indian envoy has been called for consultations at a time when the government is looking at options for giving a befitting reply to Pakistan over the dastardly terror attack in Pulwama which claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. In the wake of the attack, the Centre on Friday announced its decision to withdraw the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status granted unilaterally to Pakistan while asserting that there is 'incontrovertible evidence' about Islamabad's involvement in the gruesome terror attack. ""Most Favoured Nation status to Pakistan stands withdrawn,"" said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on Friday. India will also make all possible efforts to ensure 'complete isolation' of Pakistan in the international community and work for early adoption of the long-pending Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT), which is pending before the United Nations, he added. India had granted MFN status to Pakistan in 1996, a year after the formation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), but Pakistan never accorded the same status to India. Under the international trade rules, MFN is a treatment accorded to a trade partner to ensure non-discriminatory trade between two countries. A CRPF convoy, while moving from Jammu to Srinagar, was attacked by a suicide bomber in Lethpora area on the national highway at around 3.15 pm on Thursday. Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

"Narendra Modi: Army to decide time, place of response: PM Modi on Pulwama attacks | India News - Times of India","JHANSI/NEW DELHI: The possibility of a military strike against Pakistan appeared to loom large on Friday after the Modi government directed the armed forces to start preparing to avenge the killing of 40 CRPF personnel by ISI-controlled terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Muhammed.  The political clearance for a military response was given by the PM-led Cabinet committee on security against the backdrop of mounting anger and horror over the biggest-ever terror attack on security forces in J&K and a growing clamour for retaliation against Pakistan, which has been held responsible by the government for the atrocity.  Sources said the CCS meeting factored in the possibility of an armed confrontation with a bellicose neighbour, but resolved not to be deterred by the risk of escalation. ""They are going to get a nasty surprise yet again,"" said a senior government source familiar with the deliberations which were attended by home minister Rajnath Singh, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj, finance minister Arun Jaitley, defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, NSA Ajit Doval and Army chief General Bipin Rawat among others.  Sources also indicated India's response will focus, just like the surgical strikes launched in the aftermath of the attack on the Army camp at Uri, on terror infrastructure inside Pakistan. ""Let them try to thwart us,"" one of the participants said. The stand was articulated by Modi who, while addressing a public meeting in Jhansi in UP, said, ""Our brave jawans have sacrificed their lives in the service of the nation. Their sacrifice will not go in vain. I am giving this assurance to 130 crore Indians from the land of Jhansi, the land of the brave,"" he said.  ""The next steps will be taken by our armed forces. What should be the time, what should be the place and what should be the form, they have been authorised to take all these decisions,"" he added.  The PM had promised retaliation earlier in the day as well while speaking at the inaugural run of the high-speed Vande Bharat train in Delhi immediately after the CCS meeting. ""I want to tell the terror outfits and those aiding and abetting them that they have made a big mistake. They will have to pay a very heavy price for their actions,"" he said.  Significantly, Modi's strongly worded remarks came hours after Islamabad, predictably, washed its hands of the killings owned up by Jaish, which has lately been ISI's preferred tool to torment India.  In a statement on Thursday, Pakistan termed the attack a ""matter of grave concern"", claimed it has ""always condemned acts of violence anywhere in the world"" but trivialised its well-established parentage of Jaish as an ""insinuation"". “We strongly reject any insinuation by elements in the Indian media and government that seek to link the attack to Pakistan without investigations,” it said. The protestation of innocence failed to wash with India, with the MEA’s spokesperson pointing out that JeM has claimed responsibility for the attack and Pakistan cannot claim that it is unaware of their presence and their activities. “The demand for an investigation is preposterous when there is a video of the suicide bomber declaring himself a JeM member,” the spokesman said. In Jhansi, Modi vowed retribution. “The guilty of Pulwamawill be punished for what they have done. Our neighburing nation is forgetting that this is an India of new ‘neeti and reeti (resolve and ways)’,” he said. “130 crore Indians will give Pakistan a fitting reply. Big nations of the world are standing with India. The message I am receiving shows this. Those sitting in Pakistan should clearly understand, the path you have adopted you have seen your ruin. On the other hand, the path we have adopted is seeing us progress in leaps and bounds,” Modi said. Public anger seems to be driving the government’s response and Modi sought to address that with his “rally-around-the-flag” theme both in New Delhi and Jhansi. “I know there is deep anger, your blood boils looking at what has happened. At this moment, there are expectations of a strong response, which is quite natural,” he said. “However, let me tell you, the nation will counter such attacks. India will not be intimidated. We should speak in one voice and rise above politics. The message which should go across the world is that we are one nation, one voice in our fight against terror,” the PM said. As it prepared for a military retaliation, the support from the international community was encouraging its plan to punish Pakistan. The expression of strong support by the US was particularly reassuring for the government. Diplomatic missions scrambled for what seemed to be an effort to prepare the international community for imminent military action against terror bases in Pakistan. The Pulwama attack is a challenge to Modi’s “tough-on-terror” credentials which were burnished by the surgical strikes. He appeared to be mindful of it when he told his Jhansi audience, “I am someone who fulfils his pledges.” He further said Pakistan’s use of terror would not succeed. “Our neighbour is going through a bad phase. It is isolated.” In Video:Pulwama attack: PM Modi assures befitting reply to terroristsDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" US asks Pak to freeze funds of designated terror groups, supports actions against Jaish-e-Mohammed | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: The US on Friday asked Pakistan to “freeze without delay” the funds and other financial assets of the UNSC-designated terrorist networks and their leaders. It also said it fully supports “actions to prevent” the outlawed Jaish-e-Mohammed “from conducting future attacks”. Pakistan-based JeM has claimed responsibility for the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on Thursday that left at least 40 CRPF soldiers dead and five others critically wounded. A State Department spokesperson told PTI, ""Pakistan outlawed Jaish-e-Mohammed in 2002. However, the group still operates in Pakistan. The US designated JeM as a foreign terrorist organization in December 2001, and we fully support actions to prevent them from conducting future attacks."" In addition, the UNSC designated JeM on its 1267 ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qa'ida Sanctions List in 2001, the official noted. ""We expect Pakistan to uphold its responsibilities pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions to deny safe haven and support for terrorists and to freeze without delay the funds and other financial assets or economic resources of individuals and entities on the UNSC 1267 sanctions list,” the spokesperson said in response to a question. The official, however, did not divulge if the US has taken up the issue with the Pakistani leadership directly after the Pulwama terrorist attack. In various statements and on social media, the Trump administration has asked Pakistan to deny safe haven and end support to terrorist organizations. The spokesperson also refrained from making any comment over China blocking India's move to designate Jaish chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist. “Our views on Masood Azhar and Jaish-e-Mohammed are well known. The JeM has been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and is a threat to regional stability,” the spokesperson said. ""UN Sanctions Committee deliberations are confidential, and as such we do not comment on specific matters,"" the official said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Pulwama terror attack:  Please take care of yourselves: Pulwama martyr’s last words to family | Allahabad News - Times of India,"TUDIHAR (ALLAHABAD): He was in his native Tudihar village in Allahabad, just three days ago and he called his wife barely three hours before he was blown to smithereens in the suicide bombing in Pulwama. Mahesh Kumar told his wife, Sanjoo Devi, that his 118 battalion of CRPF was moving towards Srinagar and asked her to hand over the phone to his parents. Call it a premonition of death, Mahesh told his mother and sister to take care of the family before hanging up. All through the day, villagers thronged his home to express condolence and support, but Mahesh’s wife Sanjoo Devi was inconsolable. They were married for seven years and had two children, Samar, 6, and Sahil, 5. Mahesh’s uncle, Sushil Kumar, said the village is proud of the 26-year-old jawan, who laid down his life for the nation. “Mahesh had come home on a three-day leave and left on Monday, assuring his family he would be back soon. He wanted to be part of the armed forces since childhood and joined the CRPF in 2017 after completing his BA. His first posting was in Jammu and Kashmir,” Sushil said. The tragedy was yet to sink in for Mahesh’s two sons. “Why’s there a crowd inside our house,” asked Sahil. Unaware that father is dead, Samar and Sahil stood outside, curiously looking at the stream of guests. Sushil said, Mahesh often worried about his sons’ education and wanted them to study in a good school in Allahabad.

Pulwama attack: Tilak Raj became father for 2nd time last month | Shimla News - Times of India,"DHARAMSHALA: Cries of constable Tilak Raj’s newborn baby and bed-ridden wife Savitri Devi were the most unbearable sounds on Friday at his residence in Dehwa village in Jawali area of Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district. Thirty-one-year-old Tilak, posted with the CRPF’s 76 battalion, had became father of a second son 22 days ago. The newborn is yet to be named as the ceremony had been planned for later. He had left home to rejoin duty on February 11 after his wife was discharged from nearby government hospital after the delivery. Tilak, who belonged to a shepherd family, is survived by his elderly parents, wife and two sons. Tilak’s older son is just three years old and was seen playing in laps of the visitors. He is unable to understand why so many people were thronging his home. The family was not informed about Tilak’s death on Thursday as his wife is bed-ridden after delivery and his father Layk Ram’s health has also deteriorated. Tilak’s younger brother Baldev, who works as a salesman in Punjab, was informed by villagers late on night about his brother’s death and advised not to inform his family till he arrived home. It was only in morning when relatives started reaching their home that Tilak’s family members came to know about his death. His mother Bimla Devi and wife both could not bear the shock and fainted after relatives and villagers gathered at their house. The martyr was quite famous locally as he had uploaded videos, most shot in Kangra’s Boh valley, showing him singing folk songs under the name of Tilak Raj Shanu. Five of his songs were famous among the locals. Tilak’s brother demanded the Centre should first nab people in Kashmir who supply information to militants. “Pakistan is a secondary target, but nab the people who supplied the information about the movement of the convoy to the militants,” demanded Baldev. Kangra deputy commissioner Sandeep Kumar told TOI that Tilak’s body will reach Pathankot base by late evening on Friday and would reach his native village on Saturday morning. Himachal Pradesh cabinet minister Kishan Kapoor and local MLA Arjun Singh reached the martyr’s residence on Friday and assured the family that a member would be provided a government job.

Right from his school days, he had a healthy dose of patriotism in his blood."" Even then, he had wished to join the Army and serve the nation. Every time I asked him what he would like to become, he used to say 'I will become a soldier and serve the nation.' That was his life's desire.""

Relatives say he did all he could for his family including his two younger brothers. Guru's father Honnaiah runs a small laundry shop in KM Doddi.

Tamil Nadu loses two bravehearts in Pulwama attack | Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI/TRICHY/MADURAI: Two bravehearts from Tamil Nadu, G Subramanian and C Sivachandran, were among the CRPF jawans killed when a suicide bomber targeted their convoy in Pulwama in J&K. Subramanian’s family in Savalapperi village near Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district, initially, did not believe the media on Friday when they reported that he was dead; they had spoken to him at 2 pm on Thursday, just an hour before the blast. The family got worried when Subramaniam could not be reached over the phone. Their worst fears were confirmed when police and revenue officials shared the chief minister’s condolence message and announcement of ₹20 lakh solatium to the family. “He said he would be happy to die for the nation. But he died very young. We have been married for just 17 months,” said his wife Krishnaveni. In Karkudi village in Ariyalur, Sivachandran’s family was inconsolable; he had left home only on February 9. Sivachandran had joined the CRPF in 2010 and since then had been posted in Jammu & Kashmir. He got married to Gandhimathi in 2014 and the couple have a two-year-old son and are expecting their second child. He too had called his wife a few hours before the blast. “He always told me that he wanted to live and die for the nation. Preparing our son to clear the civil service examination and making him Indian Police Service (IPS) officer was one of his dreams,” said Sivachandran’s wife Gandhimathi. Sivachandran’s father Chinnaiyan, a farm worker, was heartbroken. Last year, he had lost his younger son, Selvachandran, who was electrocuted at his workplace in Chennai. “Sivachandran always encouraged the youth in our hamlet to join the forces,” V Arun, Gandhimathi’s brother, told TOI. Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Friday condoled the deaths of the two CRPF jawans and sanctioned ₹20 lakh each to their families. Sivachandran’s family said the compensation would not bring back their loved one. The police have told them that the body would arrive at Karkudi village on Saturday.

But if it is true we would have first got the information from the CRPF.” At one point the family got annoyed when journalists swarmed the house. “The auto recorded voice said the phone is switched off,” Krishnaveni told reporters in the afternoon. Subramanian was the youngest of four children of Ganapathi, a farmer, and Maruthammal. “From a very young age it was his desire to join the police, army or any other uniformed service and serve the country,” Ganapathi said. After schooling and completing ITI training, Subramanian joined the CRPF five years ago. He started his career in the force in Uttar Pradesh and has served in Chennai too. Subramanian used to visit his family every few months. He had come during Pongal and was home till February 9. During that period, he got his father admitted in a hospital in Tirunelveli for an eye surgery. Villagers said he was soft spoken and patriotic. He used to motivate the youth of his village to join the armed forces and serve the nation. They recalled that during his last visit, he united two groups of tussling youths and gave an elaborate speech on staying united. “If you don’t stay together, how will the nation be united?” they quoted him telling the youth. After he returned to duty, he was constantly in touch with the family over phone. Krishnaveni said their last conversation was around 2pm on Thursday, shortly before the suicide attack blew his convoy to pieces. “He said that he was on his way to deployment. I asked him if he had eaten, to which he said they had packed their food and would eat once they reach their destination. He said he would call me after reaching the destination,” she said. Susheela, his elementary school teacher, said Subramanian was a very active boy. “Even after so many years later, he would always greet me and talk respectfully,” she said.

 India to hold talks with US for ban on Jaish chief Masood Azhar | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Amid widespread anger over the Pulwama terror attack, India and the US will 'very soon' hold another round of dialogue on terrorist designation proposals. JeM chief Masood Azhar will figure prominently in the talks, official sources here said, with Indian authorities likely to push the US to bring another resolution for a UNSC ban on the terrorist who is an accused in the Pathankot airbase attack and who continues to operate with impunity from Pakistan. India and the US had in 2017 launched a new consultation mechanism for domestic and international terrorist designations, as announced in the 2017 joint statement issued after PM Narendra Modi’s summit meet with President Donald Trump. India sees US support in terrorist designation as evidence of US commitment to end terror in all its forms and manifestations. After China blocked a US backed proposal in 2017 to designate Azhar a global terrorist by the UN Security Council, the US has been wary of bringing another such proposal until the time it is assured of support from China. The US is aware that another resolution, in the face of unrelenting Chinese opposition, can at best be an exercise in occupying the moral high ground. India itself has been reluctant to push China on Azhar in the recent past, focusing instead on improving ties with China after the Doklam standoff. While Beijing did express sympathy Friday for the Pulwama victims and declared that it strongly condemned all forms of terrorism, it remained non-committal to supporting India’s demand for an international ban on Azhar. Inclusion of Azhar in the UNSC sanctions list, as Indian officials have said in the past, would result in freezing of Azhar’s financial assets, block supply of funds to JeM and also expose Pakistan’s failure to check activities of terror groups targeting India. The Pulwama attack though is certain to see India once again placing the Masood Azhar issue on top of its agenda with Beijing. While India has been trying to convince all that improved Sino-Indian relationship has been one of the highlights of its foreign policy in the past 12 months, the fact is that this 'thaw' has seen practically no concession from China not just on Azhar but also other issues like India's NSG membership bid and CPEC, the flagship BRI project which passes through the Gilgit-Baltistan region. While India has been concerned about the Trump administration’s use of Pakistan authorities for its ongoing direct talks with the Taliban, which the US sees as essential for its withdrawal of troops, India is hoping that Washington will abide by its commitment to strengthen cooperation, as the 2017 statement said, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, D-Company, and their affiliates.

SAD-BJP leaders hold stir to condemn Pulwama attack | Ludhiana News - Times of India,"Ludhiana: Showing their anger against the horrific terror attack on CRPF jawans in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, BJP leaders staged protests at various places in the city on Friday. In solidarity with the bereaved families, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) also condemned the attack on the soldiers and carried out a candle march in the city on Friday evening. The SAD-BJP leaders condemned the role of Pakistan in encouraging terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir. The terror attack had taken place on Thursday in Pulwama district of Jammu & Kashmir in which 44 CRPF jawans were killed after a suicide bomber rammed his SUV, carrying over 300kg explosive material, into one of the CRPF buses. The members of the Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) held a protest against Pakistan on Chandigarh Road. BJYM president Mahesh Sharma claimed that Pakistan has always used terrorists to attack India and Indian army and this is the biggest attack in the recent past. He said that the Indian government will give a befitting reply to Pakistan and the terrorist group behind the attack. The members of district BJP minority morcha also staged a protest on Jassian Road Haibowal against this attack. The members of SAD SC wing also held a meeting with the SC party workers in the East constituency on Friday where this attack was condemned. Former cabinet minister and state president of the SC wing of Akali Dal, Gulzar Singh Ranike, also participated in the meeting. The workers maintained a one-minute silence to pay tribute to the brave soldiers. The SAD district president Ranjit Dhillon said, “It is a very unfortunate incident and now the time has come when Pakistan and terrorism should get answer to their atrocities. The terrorism should come to end now and people of our nation also want this.” He said sacrifice by brave heart soldiers will go in vain and terrorist group Jaishe Mohammad that has taken the responsibility for this inhuman act will have to pay price for the same.

" Govt squeezes Pak trade, more curbs to follow | India News - Times of India","The government’s decision to withdraw the mostfavoured nation (MFN) status to Pakistan is unlikely to significantly impact the low trade volume between the two neighbours but is meant to signal more steps are in the offing to isolate the country already battling a severe economic crisis.  Grant of MFN status is meant to ensure that a WTO member does not discriminate between trading partners.  Officials said a formal notification to the World Trade Organisation — which mandates grant of MFN to all member countries — will be sent and the government will decide the future course of action in the coming days, which may range from prohibiting imports of certain products to increasing the customs duty on some. “With the withdrawal of MFN status all options become open,” said an official.  India has a trade surplus with Pakistan and the government’s next move would factor in those implications. “In terms of trade, it can be counter-productive but it has to be seen in the overall context of the anguish caused by the terror attack,” said former commerce secretary Rajeev Kher.  While the overall trade volume may have been less than $2.5 billion last year, a far larger chunk of the shipments are routed via third countries such as UAE and Singapore. “It is a very strong signal from India. Going forward the government needs to devise ways to stop goods coming from third countries to make the impact more visible,” said Biswajit Dhar, a professor at JNU.

 Mufti’s ‘human touch’ policy led to easing of convoy rules | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The norms for security convoy movement in J&K were relaxed when the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed-led PDP-Congress coalition government was in office from 2002 to 2005 with the objective being to reverse the negative public sentiment over civilian vehicles being regularly forced off the roads by baton-wielding security personnel tasked with maintaining the ‘closed-box’ formation of such convoys. Until 2002-03, security convoys moved in a box, with civilian traffic kept off the highway while the security vehicles passed. A pilot vehicle accompanying the convoy would continuously intercept civilian vehicles approaching the highway and shoo them off. The Sayeed government insisted that this “harassment” of civilians in the name of securing convoys be ended. The Centre, agreeing with Sayeed’s “healing touch” approach, agreed to remove the restrictions. However, some guidelines for convoy movements were introduced while allowing parallel civilian traffic. Road opening duties, involving detection of IEDs along the route, would be done prior to convoy movement and security personnel would line the route. The Army’s role was to specifically prevent terrorists from accessing the highway. Over the years, complacency led to the standard operating procedures being compromised. Besides, even if the route was swept for IEDs, there was no way that a vehicle laden with explosives could have been detected unless each and every vehicle on the highway was searched. “The only solution now is to go back to complete sanitisation of the convoy route by ensuring that civilian vehicles are kept off the road until the convoy has passed. Also, we may look at creating independent air capability for BSF and CRPF, so that troops can be transported by air,” said advisor to the home ministry and former J&K DGP, Ashok Prasad.

 Review security of those funded by Pakistan: Rajnath | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Security agencies and Jammu and Kashmir police overlooked intelligence inputs about an impending attack on paramilitary forces deployed in the Kashmir Valley, governor Satya Pal Malik has said. Malik told a private TV channel that he would call for a security review soon and would discuss the lapses. He said a befitting reply would be given to the people responsible for Thursday's suicide bombing in Pulwama .  Sources said intelligence agencies had flashed a message to all senior officers of the CRPF and J&K police a few days ago and called for precautions to preempt a terror attack. But J&K police did not pass on the information to the CRPF convoy, which had left Jammu two days ago for Srinagar, a senior intelligence officer said.  Malik and state DGP Dilbagh Singh have mostly stayed away from the Valley since the Darbar move in November 2018. Meanwhile, Union home minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday that ""although the people of J&K are with us, some of them are taking money from Pakistan and ISI"" and supporting terrorism. ""I have asked security agencies to review the security provided to those who are involved in such activities,"" he said in a veiled reference to Hurriyat Conference leaders. Civilian traffic will be restricted on highways and major roads in J&K during the movement of convoys of the Army and other forces, Singh said. ""This may cause inconvenience and I apologise for this, but this is necessary for the safety of jawans,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 A new kind of threat: CRPF DG on Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A day after 40 personnel of CRPF were killed in a car bombing in Pulwama, CRPF director general Rajeev Bhatnagar said that they have been “hit by a new kind of threat” despite taking every precaution but this has made their resolve “stronger” to carry out counter-terror operations till the terrorism is eliminated from the valley. Bhatnagar, who was in Srinagar on Friday to pay tributes to the martyrs and discuss further strategy with his subordinates, J&K police, Army and intelligence agencies, also hinted that the operations against terrorists “might intensify in coming days”. The force has already vowed to 'avenge' the killing of its men by Jaish-e-Mohammad. In a tweet on Friday, CRPF said “we will not forget, we will not forgive”. It added, “We salute our martyrs of Pulwama attack and stand with the families of our martyr brothers. This heinous attack will be avenged”. WE WILL NOT FORGET, WE WILL NOT FORGIVE:We salute our martyrs of Pulwama attack and stand with the families of our… https://t.co/wt7cZ3ZiAj— 🇮🇳CRPF🇮🇳 (@crpfindia) 1550214657000Interacting exclusively with TOI over phone from Srinagar, Bhatnagar said, “It’s a big loss to the CRPF. But this force has a history of valor and keeping up with the professionalism we have shown for ages, without forgetting the sacrifices, we are concentrating on our task”. Asked about what went wrong on Thursday, Bhatnagar reiterated that “all the arrangements/precautions were taken to avert an attack, SoPs (standard operating procedures) were followed but we were hit by a new kind of threat”. He added “CRPF has had very noticeable achievements in Kashmir including eliminating several terrorists. In fact, there was not a single attack on our convoys in last one year”. The CRPF, following the deadliest attack in Kashmir’s history, is now working on a new strategy in consultation with other agencies, which includes stopping the civilian vehicles when the convoys are on the move. TOI had reported first on Friday that CRPF had taken all steps following intelligence inputs to secure the convoy – which had 2,547 personnel, but liberty given to civilians to travel on highways during troops movement was used by JeM terrorist Aadil, who entered from the slip road to the highway before ramming the SUV in the CRPF bus. The new strategy is also likely to include reorganizing the quick reaction teams (QRTs), checkpoints at every few kms on the convoy route and keeping civilians several meters away irrespective of the inconvenience caused to them, sources said. Home minister Rajnath Singh also said on Friday that civilian traffic during convoy movements will be stopped from now on. A preliminary analysis has revealed that a “very high intensity” explosive, most likely RDX, was used in the car bomb but there weren’t any sharpnels in it. The experts, however, ruled out the quantity of explosive to be 350 kgs, as assumed earlier, saying it could be around 80 to 100 kg. Meanwhile, CRPF has asked all its formations in J&K to be on high alert and fully prepared. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 India briefs envoys about Pak 'complicity' in Pulwama | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Apart from withdrawing MFN status to Pakistan, MEA will work to isolate Pakistan from the international community, announced the government as emotions ran high over the Pulwama terror attack. Foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale summoned Pakistan high commissioner Sohail Mahmood and issued a strong demarche but, perhaps even more importantly, he also met, among other diplomats, Chinese ambassador Luo Zhaohui and called for a UNSC ban on JeM chief Masood Azhar. Gokhale’s meeting with Luo was a part of his initiative to brief envoys based in Delhi about what the government described as Pakistan’s complicity in the attack which left 40 CRPF jawans dead. The Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi wrote to Sushma Swaraj stressing that China resolutely opposed and strongly condemned all forms of terrorism. The government also asked Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria to return for consultations over the issue. When asked whether India was considering scaling down diplomatic ties with Pakistan, sources here said all options 'were on the table.' The government also did not rule out delaying opening of the Kartarpur corridor because of the attack. ""It can't be business as usual but we will have to wait and see as Kartarpur in any case can't be seen as resumption of engagement. It's only for religious purposes,"" said an official. When Gokhale met Mahmood around 2 pm, he conveyed to him that Pakistan must take ""immediate and verifiable"" action against JeM. According to sources, he also called for Pakistan to ""immediately stop any groups or individuals associated with terrorism operating from its territories"". Gokhale also rejected the statement made by the Pakistan foreign ministry, in which Pakistan had stopped short of condemning the Pulwama attack while describing it as a matter of concern, on Thursday. In its reaction, Pakistan had rejected 'any insinuation' that sought to link the 'State of Pakistan' with the attack without investigations. Until late Friday, Gokhale had met about 25 Heads of Mission based here. This included those from all P-5 countries, all South Asian countries and other important partners like Japan, Germany and Republic of Korea. ""All the HoMs were left in no doubt about the role played by Pakistan-based and supported Jaish-e-Mohammed in the terrorist attack and our demand that Pakistan ceases forthwith all support and financing to terror groups operating from areas under their control,"" said a source, adding that Gokhale also highlighted the role played by Pakistan in using terrorism as an instrument of its state policy. The government said that MEA will continue to take all steps to expose the ""complicity of Pakistan in the Pulwama terrorist attack"" and demand immediate and verifiable action against Jaish-e-Mohammed and its leader Masood Azhar.

I’ll come wrapped in Tricolour: Martyr’s vow comes true | Bhopal News - Times of India,"Bhopal/Jabalpur: I will come wrapped in the Tricolour, CRPF martyr Ashwini Kumar Kaochi used to tell his uncle. He will. On Saturday. Ashwini’s house in Jabalpur’s Khudawal village echoed with wails on Friday as his family and villagefolk struggled to come to terms with his death. He is the third from the village to be martyred — one of them, Armyman Rameshwar Lodhi, was slain in the 2016 Uri terror attack. Khudawal has about 40 men in uniform. “Mera ladka shahid ho gaya (my boy is martyred),” his mother Kaushalya screamed inside the house. Outside, Ashini’s father Sukru Kaochi and uncle Khadak Singh sat with other menfolk, struggling not to join the wailing. Revenge is the only thing on their mind, say 70-year-old Sukru and other villagers. “He was not only my son, but the country’s son. He sacrificed his life for country. It is the duty of the country to eliminate the ones responsible for this attack,” Sukru told TOI. Khadak Singh, a schoolteacher whose passion it is to train youngsters in the physical and mental skills to get into the Army and paramilitary forces, says Ashwini was one of the most determined. He remembers the day Ashwini returned home, in uniform, after his Kasam Parade (passing-out). “Mein kabhi piche nahi hatunga. Mera laksh yehi hai ki mein ek din Tirange me wapas aau (I’ll never step back. I wish to return wrapped in Tricolour one day),” he told his uncle. “He would often repeat this. Who knew it would come true,” Khadak Singh told TOI. These words seemed to break Sukru’s resolve. Tears rolling down, he said: “My boy said ‘jaldi wapas aunga (I’ll be back soon).” Ashwini last visited his family in October-November last year. His family planned to get him married this year. He had called his mother three days ago and asked her to take care of her health. The first thing he had done after getting his first pay as a CRPF jawan was to stop his mother from working in a beedi factory. Ashwini’s family’s finances were never good. His father worked as a labourer, so do his three elder brothers. Villagers, leaders from both Congress and BJP, and top officials of district administration lined up outside the martyr’s house.

 Pulwama attack: Grieving kin of martyred CRPF personnel urge to government to act | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A day after terrorist attack claimed the life of 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, a pall of gloom has descended over the villages and cities of the slain jawans. The family members of the martyred soldiers have asked the government to give a be-fitting reply to Pakistan.  In Uttar Pradesh, father of Ramesh Yadav, a soldier who lost his life in the terror attack, urged the government to initiate a probe into the matter and give a befitting reply to Pakistan.  ""My son came home 25 days back. We received a call from Srinagar yesterday evening. The officer on the line told us that a terror attack has taken place and they are not yet to recover the body of my son. Each year, many soldiers are dying in India. He was the only breadwinner of the family. Now, we will face trouble in educating his child. I request the government to give a befitting reply (muh-tod jawab) to Pakistan and also start an investigation at the earliest,"" he told ANI. In Bihar, jawan Ratan Thakur's father too urged the Centre to give a befitting response to Pakistan.  ""I have sacrificed a son in Mother India's service, I will send my other son as well to fight. Ready to give him up for Mother India, but Pakistan must be given a befitting reply,"" he said. In Rajasthan, when Rohitash Lamba, Bhagirath Singh and Hemraj Meena left their homes earlier this week with the promise that they would return to their families soon, few imagined that it would turn out to be their last visit.  Lamba, Singh and Meena were among the 40 CRPF personnel martyred. Their families recalled their passion and love for the country as they grieved the demise of their loved ones.  Barely two months ago, Lamba had expressed his joy on becoming a father on the social media.  He rejoined duty on February 12 after spending several days with his family, including his two-month-old son. A pall of gloom descended at Govindpura Basadi village near Shahpura, around 65 km from Jaipur, as the news of Lamba's death reached.  In Jharkhand, a pall of gloom has descended on Pharsma village of Vijay Soreng, who was among the martyred jawans.  ""I feel proud of the martyrdom of my son. I expect from the government of India to avenge the killings,"" Brish Soreng, a retired army person and the father of Vijay Soreng, told news persons visiting his home on Friday.  A CRPF officer gave the sad news of Vijay's death to his family last night following which villagers have been flocking his home in Pharsma village in Basia block of the district, about 94 km from capital Ranchi.  Vijay's mother said she wants a revenge for the terror attack.  Born in 1974 and completing matriculation in 1990, Vijay had joined the force in the Signal group in 1993.  The family of 27-year-old Bhagirath Singh, a resident of Jaitpur village in Dholpur district, was struggling to come to terms with the loss. On Friday, the entire village of Jaitpur mourned the death of the young man.  ""We never knew that he would leave us so early. He had promised his father and family to return soon two days ago but they had never imagined that it would be his last visit home,"" Jaitpur sarpanch Kapur Chand Gurjar said.  He said that Singh's mother had passed away when he was a kid. His father Parshuram, a farmer, brought up his two sons alone. Singh joined CRPF four years ago, whereas his younger brother Balveer joined Uttar Pradesh Police.  Singh got married Ranjna four years ago and has three-year-old son Vinay and a-year-and-a-half-old daughter Shivangi.  Hemraj Meena's wife Madhu received a call from the CRPF camp in Jammu around 10 pm Thursday, informing her about his demise.  Soon after the news reached the area, villagers came out their homes and gathered outside Meena's home to pay their tributes.  Kota-Bundi MP Om Birla, local MLA Bharat Singh, former MP Ijayraj Singh, former MLA Bhawani Singh Rajawat and several other dignitaries and administrative officials reached Meena's home and consoled the wailing family.  Hemraj Meena, the only government servant among four brothers and one sister, had been full of love for the country and patriotism since his early days, his elder brother, who runs a tea stall in the village, said.  Hemraj Meena is survived of four children -- two daughters and two sons.  In Punjab, Jaimal Singh of Moga district, Sukhjinder Singh of Tarn Taran, Maninder Singh Attri of Gurdaspur and Kulwinder Singh of Ropar were the among the CRPF martyrs.  ""Sukhjinder leaves behind a seven-month-old son, who was born after a gap of eight years. He had just come home to celebrate the first Lohri of his son. He had gone back only recently,"" Gurnam Singh, a villager said.  A resident of Ghalauti village in Dharamkot subdivision of Moga district, Jaimal Singh, 44, was the driver of the fateful bus that was blown up in the attack.  ""Our son has been martyred for the country. Though the loss can never be filled, our government and Army should teach a lesson to Pakistan for this cowardly act,"" father Jaswant Singh said.  Jaimal Singh leaves behind his ageing parents, wife, a 10-year-old son and a younger brother.  Satpal Attri, father of Maninder Singh Attri, said that his son had gone back to join duty on February 13 only and had called him up after reaching Jammu.  ""He died the very next day. We are proud of him even though our loss can never be filled,"" Satpal Attri said. Maninder's younger brother is also serving in the CRPF and is posted in Assam now.  The other trooper from Punjab who also died in the Pulwama attack is Kulwinder Singh from Anandpur Sahib area of Ropar district. He was to get married in 2019 later. In Maharashtra, hundreds of grieving locals descended on the homes of the two troopers on hearing the news of their demise. Nitin Shivaji Rathod and Sanjay Rajput were both residents of Buldhana district in Vidarbha.  Hailing from a farming family of Chorpangra village, Rathod (36) joined the CRPF in 2006. He leaves behind his wife Vandana and two minor children — Jeevan (8) and Jivika (5).  ""We are shattered by the news, which we received shortly after midnight. Our aged parents Shivaji Rathod and Savitribai are inconsolable,"" said Rathod's younger brother Pravin, who helps his parents on their farm.  Sanjay Rajput from Malkapur village had joined the paramilitary force almost 20 years ago and served in J&K, Chhattisgarh and the Northeast.

" Pulwama attack: Aadhaar cards, force IDs helped identify dead CRPF men | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Aadhaar cards, ID cards, leave applications and certain other articles were the only things left of most of the 40 CRPF personnel killed in the Pulwama terror attack that helped their colleagues identify them, officials said Friday. Five CRPF personnel were also injured in Thursday's attack, one of the deadliest in Jammu and Kashmir in three decades, when a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district. Officials said as the bodies of the troops were badly mutilated and charred due on the impact of the RDX-triggered blast, it became very difficult to ascertain their identities. Most of the slain jawans were either identified by their Aadhaar cards, force IDs, PAN cards or leave applications kept in their pockets and bags. Some of them were identified by their colleagues by the watches or wallets they had on, a senior official said. A good number of men, another official said, escaped death by sheer luck as they aborted their journey last moment. The officials at the Srinagar and Jammu bases of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) undertook the daunting task of making hundreds of calls to the families of the jawans who were part of the convoy to establish that none was missing and the identities of the dead were correct. One jawan was found to be in Delhi while another had aborted the journey last moment due to some urgent work in Jammu, the second official said. As the bodies were badly mutilated, they said, it took a long time for the doctors and the force brass in Srinagar to declare the number of casualties. The CRPF headquarters in Delhi released a list of the 40 killed personnel only late Friday evening after their identities were firmly established with the help of forensic profiling and matching them with their belongings that were recovered from the blast spot, they said.

She questioned why the Centre was not declaring national mourning for the CRPF jawans and said ""Will mourning take place only when political leaders die?"" ""I demand 72 hours mourning for the ultimate sacrifice of the soldiers. At least for national respect. Only one flag is not enough for it,"" she told reporters after returning from New Delhi.

 Trump bluntly tells Pakistan to end terrorism | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The Trump White House on Friday bluntly asked Islamabad to “end immediately the support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil” following the Pulwama attack, going much beyond a more cautious state department approach towards Islamabad. Although the State Department also condemned the attack in the “strongest terms” and said the “United States is resolutely committed to working with the Indian government to combat terrorism in all its forms,” it lamely called on “all countries to uphold their responsibilities pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions to deny safe haven and support for terrorists,” — as if, given that the statement was about the Pulwama attack, there was more than one country playing host to UN-designated terrorists. President Trump’s office had no such equivocation as it implicitly accused Pakistan of fostering and inflicting terrorism on the region. Terming it a “heinous” terrorist attack, the White House said “The United States calls on Pakistan to end immediately the support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil, whose only goal is to sow chaos, violence, and terror in the region.” “This attack only strengthens our resolve to bolster counterterrorism cooperation and coordination between the United States and India,” the statement added, going beyond the State Department’s formulation that “The United States is resolutely committed to working with the Indian government to combat terrorism in all its forms.” President Trump has whittled down US aid to Pakistan to almost zero, a policy that does not sit well with many State Department bureaucrats who believe Washington should continue to lubricate a state closely identified with the use of terrorism as a policy instrument. It’s not often that the White House and the State Department read from a different page, but in this case, the White House unequivocally went beyond the rather circumspect formulation in Foggy Bottom to call out Pakistan for its terrorism. It is not clear if this was the result of any direct intervention by Trump, who is not known to pull punches in identifying adversaries, and who does not see Pakistan in any considerate light given its long and transparent history of hosting terrorists. The US President was engaged for the most part on Thursday and Friday with the scrap over border wall funding as he prepared to declare a national emergency.

" Pulwama attack: Islamabad denies any role, reaction mixed on Pak social media and TV | India News - Times of India","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has denied having any role in the suicide attack in Kashmir carried out by Jaish-e-Muhammed, a terrorist organisation believed to be based on Pakistani soil. Following Thursday’s attack in Pulwama, Islamabad rejected any allegation linking the attack to Pakistan without any evidence. India, however, strongly believes that the deadly suicide attack on it troops was the handiwork of Pakistan. The presence of Jaish chief Maulana Masood Azhar, reportedly in Bahawalpur region of Pakistan’s Punjab province, gives credence to the Indian government and media’s claims that Pakistan has long given safe haven to Jaish-e-Muhammed militants and accused it of having a “direct hand” in the Pulwama attack that left 44 CRPF troops dead. India has demanded Masood Azhar’s extradition a number of times but Islamabad has always refused citing lack of evidence. “The attack in Pulwama is a matter of grave concern. We have always condemned acts of violence anywhere in the world,” Dr Muhammad Faisal, the Pakistan foreign office spokesperson, said in a tweet on Friday. “We strongly reject any insinuation by elements in the Indian media and government that seek to link the attack to Pakistan without investigations,” he asserted. A mixed sort of reaction was seen on social media and TV channels in Pakistan regarding the attack in the Kashmir valley and the Indian government and media’s response towards it. “2 terror attacks in Pakistan’s 2 neighbours (Iran and India) this week, 2 Pak based militant outfits (jaish-ul-Adl & JeM) accepted responsibility for the attacks. Isn’t the tail still wagging the dog? Who will believe Pak claims with LeT, JeM & “good Taliban” operating unhindered? … (sic)” tweeted Afrasiab Khattak, a prominent Pakistani politician, human rights activist and former senator. Sherry Rehman, a Pakistani senator and former ambassador to the US, said Modi’s India was escalating its response to a heinous terror attack in Kashmir by premising Pakistan’s hand in it. “Yet Islamabad makes no gains from such an attack. Instead of a political response to years of brutal repression in Kashmir, hysteria is being amplified against Pakistan,” Rehman said in a tweet.

" Pakistan summons Indian Deputy High Commissioner, rejects claims of link to Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India","ISLAMABAD: In a tit-for-tat move, Pakistan on Friday summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner here and lodged a protest against India's allegation of its role in the brutal Pulwama terrorist attack. Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has claimed responsibility for the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on Thursday that left 40 CRPF soldiers dead and five critically wounded. The summoning of the Indian diplomat comes after India earlier in the day summoned Pakistan HC to India Sohail Mahmood and issued a very strong demarche over the killing of the CRPF soldiers. Pakistan must take ""immediate and verifiable action"" against the JeM and that it must immediately stop any groups or individuals associated with terrorism operating from its territories, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told the envoy. Though the Foreign Office has not issued any statement, sources said the FO summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissioner and rejected ""baseless allegations made by India"" against Pakistan on the Pulwama attack. A short video clip of the Indian diplomat leaving the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also circulating in the social media. Meanwhile in a tweet, FO spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said Pakistan Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua today briefed ambassadors of the United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and China on the Pulwama attack and rejected India's allegations. ""FS today briefed P5 Ambassadors at MoFA. Rejected Indian allegations on Pulwama attack,"" he tweeted. ""FS said Pakistan has pursued a constructive approach towards India. Pakistan's offer of dialogue and the #Kartarpur initiative are a clear evidence of this. Ratcheting up tensions in the region will be counterproductive,"" Faisal added. Following the Pulwama terror attack, India Friday withdrew the 'most-favoured nation' status to Pakistan, a move which would enable India to increase customs duty on goods coming from the neighbouring country. In a media briefing after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the most-favoured nation (MFN) status to Pakistan stands revoked. India granted the MFN status to Pakistan way back in in 1996, but the neighbouring country has not yet reciprocated. According to sources, Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria has also been called to Delhi for consultations in the wake of the horrific attack. Meanwhile, Pakistan's information minister Fawad Chaudhry said in an interview that Pakistan would take action against anyone if India share evidence.

" Despite Pulwama attack, no change in China’s stance on Masood Azhar | India News - Times of India","BEIJING: The dastardly attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama by Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) notwithstanding, China signalled on Friday that it would not change its stance on Masood Azhar, head of the Pakistan-based terrorist organization. At a media briefing here, the Chinese foreign ministry made it clear that it would not support India’s efforts to persuade the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council to list Azhar as a global terrorist. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has repeatedly blocked India’s bid to list Azhar as a global terrorist, saying there is no consensus in the top group of the world body on this issue. “I could tell you that the 1267 Committee of the Security Council has a clear stipulation on the listing and procedure of the terrorist organisations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, adding, “JeM has been included in the Security Council terrorism sanctions list. China will continue to handle the relevant sanctions issue in a constructive and responsible manner.” “China has noted the reports of the suicide attack. We are deeply shocked by this attack. We express deep condolences and sympathy to the injured and bereaved families,” the spokesperson said, adding, “We firmly oppose and strongly condemn all forms of terrorism.” The ministry chose its words carefully saying it is opposed to “all forms of terrorism” instead of specifically condemning the attack in Pulwama. The Chinese response came only after questions were raised at the regular media briefing of the foreign ministry. There was no specific response from Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi as one would have expected after a series of friendly meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping last year. The foreign ministry indirectly appealed to both India and Pakistan to avoid an altercation on this issue. “We hope the relevant regional countries will cooperate to cope with the threat of terrorism and jointly uphold regional peace and stability,” Geng said. There was no sign of meetings between Indian diplomats and Chinese officials on the Pulwama attack. China’s official media including Xinhua news agency described JeM as a Pakistan-based terrorist organization in its reports about the Pulwama attack. But there was no mention of Azhar.

Pulwama terror attack news: 80 kg high-grade RDX used; 7 detained by J&amp;K cops | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR/DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir Police have detained seven people from Pulwama district of South Kashmir in connection with the deadly terror attack that left 40 CRPF personnel dead near Awantipora, officials said on Friday. According to officials, high-grade RDX explosive, weighing about 80 kilogram, was used in the suicide attack on the CRPF bus. The youths were detained from Pulwama and Awantipora on suspicion of links with the planning of the suicide attack, the first of its kind in which a terrorist of Jaish-e-Mohammed detonated an explosive-laden vehicle near a CRPF bus. The overall planning of the attack is believed to have been done by a Pakistani national, Kamran of JeM, who has been operating and moving in Pulwama, Awantipora and Tral areas of South Kashmir. The suicide attacker was identified as Adil Ahmad from Kakapora in Pulwama. He had joined the JeM in 2018. According to initial investigations, the planning for the terror strike was done at Midoora area of Tral in South Kashmir. Police are also looking for another local JeM overground worker who was instrumental in arranging the explosive material. 80 kg high-grade RDX used by Jaish terrorist in Pulwama attackThe officials said a post-blast investigation conducted by security agencies has found that ""high-grade RDX"" of about 80 kilogram was detonated in the blast that was carried out by a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist after he rammed his explosive laden vehicle into the ill-fated bus--HR 49 F 0637--from the left side. The suicide attack took place at the 272nd milestone on National Highway near Latoomode in Pulwama at about 3:33 pm. The officials said the scattered remains of the bus, reduced to blackened bare frames after the blast, does not reflect that an improvised explosive device (IED) was used to target it. The fatal damage can be wreaked by a better grade of explosive like RDX, they said. The attacked bus was the fifth in the convoy of 78 vehicles which also included as many as 16 bullet-proof protection bunker vehicles that had joined the convoy an hour back from the last halt spot of Qazigund to guard troop movement. The suicide attack was a novel way to ambush the convoy by ramming an explosives laden vehicle, leaving little for the mobile contingent protection units to do, the official said. The terrorist drove the vehicle on the highway from a link road on the Kakapora-Lelhar side and was moving parallel to the bus belonging to the 76th battalion, and the investigators suspect the explosion was triggered. Assistant sub inspector Mohan Lal, deployed on the highway as part of the road opening party (ROP), also got trapped in the blast and was the 40th trooper to be killed. The last such convoy had moved from Jammu to Kashmir on February 4 in 91 vehicles and had 2,871 personnel but all went well that day, they said. The movement of convoys was shut for the last few days due to bad weather in the valley. The attack in Pulwama has prompted the CRPF to tweak the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the movement of its convoys in the future by providing additional security personnel in the buses that transport troops to and from the Kashmir valley. Home minister Rajnath Singh also announced in Srinagar that civilian traffic movement during plying of convoys will be restricted. The martyred personnel hailed from Uttar Pradesh (12), Rajasthan (5), Punjab (4), West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Bihar two each and one each from Assam, Kerala, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. There were 27 constables in service profiles of combat, cook, driver and bugler, 12 head constables and an ASI. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Chhattisgarh: CRPF Battalion in Bastar remembers ‘Daredevil’ killed in Pulwama attack | Raipur News - Times of India,"RAIPUR: They called him Daredevil. In 2018, then posted in Maoist-hit Bijapur, CRPF trooper Vasantha Kumar VV had charged into an ambush zone alone after an IED blast to save an injured colleague. All the Vs in his name stood for ‘Victor’, say his colleagues, mourning his loss in the Pulwama attack. A Keralite, Vasantha was posted with 85 CRPF Battalion in Bijapur, fighting Maoists. He was part of a road-opening party one day in March when they were hit by an IED explosion. A CRPF trooper, Laxman Rao, took the brunt of it and lay injured, his legs nearly ripped off. Maoists usually follow up an IED blast with a barrage of gunfire. While the rest of the CRPF team took cover, and prepared to retaliate, Vasantha Kumar leapt to the rescue. “He was walking behind me when rebels triggered the blast. I was severely injured and bleeding profusely from both of my legs. I couldn’t move and was in excruciating pain. In such cases, jawans move with extra caution, suspecting that more IEDs are planted, but Vasantha Kumar acted boldly. Without caring for his life, he jumped towards me, and tied up the wound with his uniform in order to stop the bleeding. Otherwise I would have died,” Rao told TOI. “It was a daredevil act,” recalls Sudhir Kumar, commandant of CRPF 85 Battalion in Bijapur. “In such a tense situation, Vasantha Kumar gave first-aid to Rao, lifted him and ran all the way to the road where an ambulance was waiting. Rao’s legs had to be amputated but his life was saved because Vasantha acted so fast and with such bravery.” For his selfless act of courage, commandant Sudhir Kumar recommended Vasantha’s name for the DG Disc commendation, which is awarded by the director general of CRPF. “After that incident, Vasantha was fondly called daredevil of the battalion,” Kumar said. After Vasantha’s tour of Bijapur, he was posted out in July to Bhadrachalam in Telangana. He was recently sent to Srinagar after being promoted as head constable. “He was someone you would like to have next to you when under fire. He was an asset to the force,” said Kumar.

Jaish terrorists attack CRPF convoy in Kashmir, kill at least 40 personnel 40 CRPF personnel were killed and five injured on Thursday in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir when a Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district. The bus was part of a convoy of 78 vehicles carrying CRPF personnel from Jammu to Srinagar. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said those responsible for the attack will pay ""a very heavy price"" and security forces will be given a free hand to deal with terrorists. In a hard-hitting speech, Modi said the ""blood of the people is boiling"" and forces behind the act of terrorism will be definitely punished.

 80 kg high-grade RDX used by Jaish terrorist in Pulwama attack | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: High-grade RDX explosive, weighing about 80 kilogram, was used in a suicide attack on a CRPF bus that killed 40 security personnel in one of the deadliest terror strikes on security forces in the Kashmir Valley in three decades, officials said Friday. The attack in Pulwama has prompted the CRPF to tweak the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the movement of its convoys in the future, by providing additional security personnel in the buses that transport troops to and from the Kashmir valley. Home minister Rajnath Singh had also said in Srinagar that civilian traffic movement during plying of convoys will be restricted. The officials said a post-blast investigation conducted by security agencies has found that ""high-grade RDX"" of about 80 kilogram was detonated in the blast that was carried out by a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist after he rammed his explosive laden SUV into the ill-fated bus--HR 49 F 0637--from the left side. The suicide attack took place at the 272nd milestone on National Highway near Latoomode in Pulwama at about 3:33 pm. The officials said the scattered remains of the bus, reduced to blackened bare frames after the blast, does not reflect that an improvised explosive device (IED) was used to target it. The fatal damage can be wreaked by a better grade of explosive like RDX, they said. The attacked bus was the fifth in the convoy of 78 vehicles which also included as many as 16 bullet-proof protection bunker vehicles that had joined the convoy an hour back from the last halt spot of Qazigund to guard troop movement. The suicide attack was a novel way to ambush the convoy by ramming an explosives laden vehicle, leaving little for the mobile contingent's protection units to do, the official said. The terrorist drove the vehicle on the highway from a link road on the Kakapora-Lelhar side and was moving parallel to the bus belonging to the 76th battalion, and the investigators suspect the explosion was triggered, killing all 39 occupants. Assistant Sub Inspector Mohan Lal, deployed on the highway as part of the road opening party (ROP), also got trapped in the blast and was the 40th trooper to be killed. The last such convoy had moved from Jammu to Kashmir on February 4 in 91 vehicles and had 2,871 personnel but all went well that day, they said. The movement of convoys was shut for the last few days due to bad weather in the valley. The killed personnel hailed from Uttar Pradesh (12), Rajasthan (5), Punjab (4), West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Bihar two each and one each from Assam, Kerala, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. There were 27 constables in service profiles of combat, cook, driver and bugler, 12 head constables and an ASI. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

MFN status to Pakistan revoked after Pulwama attack: What it means - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India on Friday withdrew the 'most-favoured nation' or MFN status to Pakistan after a terror attack which took lives of at least 40 CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) personnel in Jammu and Kashmir. The country is considering punitive actions like significant hike in customs duties, port curbs and ban on goods imported from Pakistan. This is one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir when a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district. The move to remove MFN status would enable India to increase customs duty on goods coming from the neighbouring nation. Pictures: Pulwama attacklivebudget updatesmoreupdatesWhen was it given to Pakistan:India granted the MFN status to Pakistan way back in in 1996, but the neighbouring country has not yet reciprocated. In 2012, Pakistan had committed to giving the MFN status to India but retracted later. Instead of MFN, Pakistan said it was working on granting Non-Discriminatory Market Access (NDMA) status to India but that also was not announced. The MFN status was accorded under WTO's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Both India and Pakistan are signatories to this; and are members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which means they have to treat each other and the other WTO member countries as favoured trading partners in terms of imposing customs duties on goods. What happens when India removes MFN status:Removal of this status means India can now enhance customs duties to any level on goods coming from Pakistan, a trade expert said. Withdrawal of the MFN status would significantly hit Pakistan's exports to India, which stood at $488.5 million (around Rs 3,482.3 crore) in 2017-18. Last year in November, a senior aide to Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan had said that the country has ""no immediate plans"" to grant MFN status to India. Pakistan allows only 137 products to be exported from India through the Wagah border land route. Total India-Pakistan trade has increased marginally to $2.41 billion in 2017-18 as against $2.27 billion in 2016-17. India imported goods worth $488.5 million in 2017-18 and exported goods worth $1.92 billion in that fiscal. Under MFN pact, a WTO member country is obliged to treat the other trading nation in a non-discriminatory manner, especially with regard to customs duty and other levies. What India imports and exports:India mainly exports cotton, dyes, chemicals, plastics, vegetables and iron and steel; while it imports fruits, cement, leather and spices. The main items which Pakistan exports to India include fresh fruits, cement, petroleum products, bulk minerals and ores and finished leather. The CCS meet was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the security scenario in J&K in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack. Pros of MFN:MFN status is helpful for the developing nations. The countries with the status have broader access to a market for trade goods, reduced cost of export items owing to highly reduced tariffs and trade barriers. It also reduces the bureaucratic hurdles and varied kinds of other tariffs for imports. It then increases demands for the goods and giving a boost to the economy and export sector. What commerce ministry said:The commerce ministry would soon notify to the World Trade Organization (WTO) its decision to revoke the MFN status to Pakistan on security grounds, an official said. The ministry would work on a list of goods imported from Pakistan over which India would increase the customs duties.

We hope relevant regional countries will cooperate to cope with the threat of terrorism and jointly uphold regional peace and stability,"" Geng said. When asked about China's stand on the listing of Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN Security Council, he said: ""As for the issue of listing, I could tell you that the 1267 Committee of Security Council has a clear stipulation on the listing and procedure of the terrorist organisations"". ""JeM has been included in the Security Council terrorism sanctions list. China will continue to handle the relevant sanctions issue in a constructive and responsible manner,"" he said in an apparent reference to external affairs ministry's appeal to all members of the UN security council to list Azhar as a global terrorist.

Pulwama news: Allowing civilian vehicles on route proved disastrous | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Central Reserve Police Force had taken all the precautions on Thursday including road opening party (RoP) sanitizing the Jammu-Srinagar highway for IEDs, men on the lookout for any possible grenade lobbing or firing by the terrorists but being sensitive towards the civilians by allowing them to use the highway during convoy movements proved costly for the paramilitary force. Senior CRPF officials told TOI that Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) suicide bomber Aadil Ahmad used the liberty provided to the civilians as he drove from the service road, connecting local villages, to the highway and “rammed” the explosive-laden Scorpio car in the CRPF bus before exploding it. The CRPF was moving 2,547 CRPF jawans/officers in two convoys moving close to each other from Jammu to South Kashmir in 78 vehicles including, buses, armoured vehicles and jeeps. Pictures: CRPF men killed in Pulwama terror attackSurgical strike 2.0? PM's tough talk after Pulwama attack sparks buzzOfficials say the Jammu-Srinagar highway was closed for six days due to which troopers, who had reported back in Jammu from leave, training, etc, were not able to reach their respective duty camps and hence the movement was bigger than usual on Thursday. Irrespective of that, sources say, every precaution was taken considering there were regular intelligence inputs about possible IED attacks, with latest shared by J&K police on February 8. Pictures: CRPF men killed in Pulwama terror attackCRPF inspector general (operations) in Kashmir – Zulfiqar Hassan told TOI, “The RoP was in place. It had checked the route in the morning. There was no IED and there was no possibility that somebody could have fired upon or lobbed grenade (s) on the convoy. It seems, as of now, that the car came from the side road to the highway and rammed into the convoy, but it is subjected to investigation”. Pulwama terror attack: India withdraws Most Favoured Nation status to PakistanAdmitting that they were caught by surprise despite taking all the precautions, other CRPF officials said “it was a completely different modus operandi” used by the terrorists after the ages. “Usually, keeping in mind that civilians don’t feel harassed by our movement, we allow commuter vehicles on the highway when we are on the move. If the Scorpio car had come far, it would have been stopped at some checkpoint, but it probably used a side road to enter the highway like other civilian vehicles,” an officer said, requesting anonymity. Pulwama attack 'matter of grave concern': PakistanHe added that they will now change their “strategy” which may include keeping highway out of bounds for the local traffic till the convoys pass. The director general CRPF - Rajeev Bhatnagar had last year told TOI in an exclusive interview that “use of IEDs had returned to Kashmir which was a worry for them”. CRPF has expertise in tracking IEDs on roads but officials said that if a vehicle looks like a normal civilian car, moving adjacent to our vehicle, rams into us, it is something we cannot know despite our thousand checks unless we completely stop such traffic. The CRPF had last year issued standing operating procedures (SoPs) related to IEDs on the roads, which were regularly checked by RoPs, and commandoes kept an eye on militants trying to fire on convoys. However, the two convoys didn’t have the slightest inclination of JeM using such a modus operandi. Sources say that JeM, known for fidayeen attacks, is frustrated that it has not been able to carry any major attack last year and lost many of its cadres in security operations. An NIA team will visit the blast site on Friday morning to collect forensic evidence as preliminary analysis suggests that Jaish-e-Mohammad may have used over 300 kgs of explosives in the blast.

Terrorist attack in Pulwama: Govt blames Pakistan after Pulwama youth rams CRPF convoy with IED-packed SUV in worst-ever J&amp;K terror strike | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: India on Thursday held Pakistan directly responsible for the worst-ever terrorist attack in J&K earlier in the day in which a suicide bomber belonging to ISI-controlled terrorist outfit Jaishe-Mohammad (JeM) rammed an explosive-laden Scorpio SUV into a bus carrying CRPF personnel, turning the bus into a mangled heap and killing at least 37. Another 5 injured personnel are being treated at the 92 Base Hospital. The bomber, identified by a JeM spokesman as Adil Ahmed Dar, drove the Scorpio into the bus at 3.15 pm on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway at Lethpora in Avantipura area of Pulwama district of south Kashmir, a hotbed of Pakistan-fuelled terrorism. Though Adil alias Waqas Commando, a local from Gundi Bagh in Pulwama, was the lone occupant of the SUV rigged with explosives, he had the cover of JeM terrorists who opened fire on the CRPF men who were in three other buses to stop them from coming to the help of their fellow troopers. The victims, as well as those in the three other buses which formed the convoy, were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar to resume work after returning from leave. The attack surpassed the Uri attack on the camp of the Army, which had led the Modi government to launch surgical strikes against terrorist groups operating from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. India pinned the responsibility for the carnage on Pakistan. “The heinous and despicable act has been perpetrated by Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistan-based and supported terrorist organisation proscribed by the United Nations and other countries. This terror group is led by international terrorist Masood Azhar, who has been given full freedom by the government of Pakistan to operate and expand his terror infrastructure in territories under control of Pakistan and to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere with impunity,” the ministry of external affairs said. It further said, “The GOI is firmly and resolutely committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard national security. We are equally resolved to fight against the menace of terrorism. We demand that Pakistan stop supporting terrorist and terror groups operating from their territory and dismantle the infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries.” Pakistan tried to de-link itself from the terrorist attack through a media release issued by its foreign office. While expressing concern over the attack, it rejected 'insinuation' in the Indian media and government, blaming it for the attack without investigation. EDITOR'S NOTE: Many of our readers have expressed concern over the headline ""Govt blames Pak after local youth rams CRPF convoy with IED-packed SUV in worst-ever J&K terror strike"".

While fully appreciating these sentiments, we wish to point out that our entire coverage was unambiguous in stating that the terrorist was a member of Pakistan-based and controlled Jaish-e-Mohammad. In fact, there is a detailed report on Pakistan’s intelligence agency increasingly using Jaish as its ‘sword arm’ to organise terror attacks in India.TOI condemns terror and grieves for the families of those martyred in Thursday's attack.

"Attack on CRPF in ammu and Kashmir's Pulwama:  Pulwama attack: Punjab CM asks Centre to give befitting reply to Pak Army, ISI | Chandigarh News - Times of India","CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday asked Centre to give a befitting reply to Pakistan Army and ISI against indulging in any such games in Punjab, a day after 38 CRPF personnel were martyred in a terrorist attack on a convoy of the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama. On the fourth day of the budget session on Friday, the Punjab state assembly also passed a unanimous resolution strongly condemning the barbaric attack by Jaish terrorists on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama on Thursday. The House was then adjourned for the day. However, Amarinder hoped the attack will not impact Kartarpur Corridor and reiterated his plea for visa-free 'khule darshan’. Captain Amarinder said that he was confident the corridor would be well protected but said there was a need for a change in attitude on the part of Pakistan. While moving the resolution in the assembly seeking an adjournment, Amarinder said time to talk peace with Pakistan was over. He sought retaliation from the central government against Pakistan stating it had been blatantly supporting terror in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as in Punjab. He said inside the assembly that everyday Indian soldiers were being killed by the enemy from across the border. ""A Major and two jawans from 2nd Sikh had lost their lives as well. Things are getting out of control now, Punjab had also suffered terror in the 80s and the 90s and fought it with a strong police force,"" he added. The chief minister sent out a stern warning to Pakistan Army chief, General Bajwa and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan against continuing with their policy of linking Kashmir and Punjab separators. “We have a force of 81,000 fully motivated men and equipped, who have passed the test of fire,” said the chief minister, declaring that if Bajwa (Pak army chief) and ISI tried anything now in Punjab they would get a resounding response. He made it clear this is not the 80s while noting that the Punjab police was much bigger and better equipped today. Amarinder accused Imran of playing a double game in his policy viz-a-viz India, promoting anti-Indian forces on the one hand and talking of starting a university in the name of Guru Nanak Dev besides serving the gurdwaras on the other. He had been made prime minister by ISI and was completely at their service, he added. Seeking an adjournment motion, the chief minister said the hearts of all Indians go out to the families of the 41 CRPF men killed in the dastardly attack, the toll of which was still being counted. The resolution read, ""The house strongly condemns the barbaric attack by Jaish terrorists on the convoy of the CRPF in Pulwama that left 41 brave personnel dead and many others injured. Most of the personnel were on their way back to join their duties to defend the borders of India after their holidays. The sacrifice of these martyrs should not go waste and I urge the centre to ensure a befitting response to this attack on our country. The attack exposes the double standards of the Pakistan government, who on one hand is talking of peace and on the other actively supporting these terror outfits in Jammu and Kashmir. We are all with the families of these martyred soldiers in their hour of grief and extend our heartfelt condolences to them.” Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) legislator Bikram Singh Majithia said the chief minister had spoken like a soldier and a true Indian. Such a big tragedy had never occurred earlier, he said, adding that the House’s request for condemnation of Pakistan and Prime Minister Imran Khan should be placed on record. AAP leader Harpal Singh Cheema sought Rs 1 crore compensation and jobs for the kin of the four deceased from Punjab, to which the chief minister later told media persons outside the House that it was a small issue and would be done. Stating that Islamabad was trying to link the terrorists of Punjab and J& K, Amarinder said that there were reports of the neighbouring country trying to foment trouble in Punjab, where as many as 28 terror modules had been busted in recent months. The Referendum 2020 of SJF, which was clearly working at ISI’s behest, was also a sign of their continued attempts to disturb peace in Punjab, he said.

One of the flagged transcripts said 'bada hona chahiye, Hindustan rona chahiye (it should be big, India should cry).' These interceptions coincided with JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar sending Ghazi to the Valley, sources said.

Adil Ahmed Dar:  Pulwama suicide bomber was inspired by Taliban 'victory' over US in Afghanistan | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Adil Ahmed Dar, a young man from Pulwama, was inspired to become a suicide bomber after the Taliban claimed victory since the US announced the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan. Minutes after the deadly terror attack in Pulwama, Telegram channels were abuzz with two videos and a picture of a youth who claimed responsibility. The videos, one in Kashmiri (seven minutes long) and the other in Urdu (10 minutes), presented Adil's 'martyrdom' message. The videos seemed to have been shot in advance by Jaish, way before the attack. Claiming to be from Jaish-e—Mohammed, the youth identified himself as Adil Ahmed Dar alias Waqas Commander from Gandibagh, Kakapora area in Pulwama. Police sources confirmed Adil as the suspected suicide bomber who drove an explosive laden Scorpio and rammed it into a CRPF bus. A fair-complexioned young man with a stubble and short hair, Adil, in both the videos, is seen holding an M4 carbine and a Browning pistol. An AK47 assault rifle is kept on his left and a sniper rifle with a night sight scope can be seen on the right. There are ten grenades and equal number of magazines. The videos have been shot with a Jaish-e-Mohammed banner in the backdrop. Police sources confirmed the claim made by Adil that he joined Jaish-e-Mohammad a year ago. “After waiting for an entire year, I got the chance to do what I joined the Jaish for,” he is heard saying in both the videos. “By the time this video reaches you, I will be enjoying in heaven... This is my last message for the people of Kashmir,"" Adil is heard saying. He exhorted the Kashmiri youth to wage jihad against India and for Islam. “Jaish has kept the flame alive and stayed put in adverse circumstances.. Come, join the group and prepare for one last fight,” Adil says in a heavily accented boyish voice. In the Kashmiri language video, it is Adil’s picture and voice over, repeating almost the same message except for a few variations. He asks his family, friends and relatives “to celebrate his martyrdom for Islam” the way they celebrate weddings. Adil also gives Kashmiri youth Islamic sermons, urging women to wear veil and boys not to fall in love. Interestingly, the video after every minute is interrupted by an American female automated voice warning, “created with free version, for non-commercial use” indicating Jaish’s access to high technology and social media machinery. A large number of social media accounts, based in Kashmir and Pakistan, became active soon after the attack, rejoicing Jaish’s daredevil act. Towards the end, in the Kashmiri video, Adil says that Muslims across the world need to be freed from foreign occupiers, by way of martyrdom. He underlines the success of jihad waged by Taliban, which he claims ensured the defeat of the US in Afghanistan. The freedom of Muslims in Kashmir, he said, can be attained only by “martyrdom”.

 Pulwama attack: India’s Azhar stand at UN may now change | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Describing the Pulwama terror attack as “heinous and despicable”, India used strong words to ask Pakistan to stop supporting terrorists and called upon all other countries to place Masood Azhar in the UN Security Council’s counter-terrorism sanctions list. China has consistently stopped Azhar from being banned, as part of its relationship with Pakistan. Every time Azhar has been proposed for a ban in the UN Security Council’s 1267 Committee, China has blocked it. In its statement, MEA said, the terror attack was “perpetrated by Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based and supported terrorist organisation proscribed by the United Nations and other countries. This terror group is led by the international terrorist Masood Azhar, who has been given full freedom by the government of Pakistan to operate and expand his terror infrastructure in the territories under the control of Pakistan and to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere with impunity.” Calling for international support against Azhar, India said “we reiterate our appeal to all members of the international community to support the proposal to list terrorists, including JeM chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council and to ban terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan.” But in all of 2018, India did not push the Azhar case in the UN at all. After the Wuhan summit between Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping, India has been treading on eggshells where China is concerned, going the extra distance to not disturb the fragile peace with China. This was taken to mean that contentious issues like Masood Azhar was not flagged by India in the UN. The general policy before Wuhan was that India or the US or UK would raise the Azhar issue in the 1267 committee as a way to keep the pressure on China and to expose its support to a terror leader. But in 2018, India eased that pressure. Thursday’s attack has resurrected the possibility of taking Azhar case back to the UNSC. This could be one of the first responses by the Modi government. Not only Masood Azhar, his brother Abdul Rauf Asghar has also been named as a terror leader to be proscribed. The JeM organisation itself has been proscribed by the 1267 Committee, but Azhar remains out of its ambit.
