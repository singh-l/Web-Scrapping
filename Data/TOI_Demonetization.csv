"India’s first demonetisation, a 100 years ago in Hyderabad | Hyderabad News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: The year 2020 marks the centenary of India's first demonetisation of paper currency. It was in 1920 that the Nizam government in Hyderabad had withdrawn Rupee 1 paper currency from circulation. The Nizam had introduced Rs 10 and Rs 100 paper currency in 1918 and Rupee 1 in 1919 as there was severe shortage of metal particularly silver in view of the World War I. There were, however, no takers for the Rupee 1 note as it had no intrinsic value though backed by a government guarantee, while Rupee 1 silver coin, which was in circulation then, had intrinsic value as it had silver in weight. Moreover, the Rupee 1 note was printed in black. People saw the colour as inauspicious and thus refused to accept it. This forced the Nizam to withdraw the note within one year of its introduction, heralding India's first demonetisation. According to senior banker and expert numismatist Amarbir Singh, the British government had conferred on the princely state of Hyderabad the right to mint its own coins. ""During World War I, due to extreme shortage of metal, especially silver, Hyderabad was finding it difficult to meet the demand of money markets. The British government suggested that Hyderabad improve the situation by issuing paper currency. This resulted in the Hyderabad Currency Act 1917/1918 which got Nizam VII, Mir Osman Ali Khan's assent on June 4, 1918,"" he said. In 1861, the British government became the sole issuer of paper currency and all private banks, which had their own banknotes, were directed to withdraw them. But the first legal tender (Re 1) issued by a government (Hyderabad state) was withdrawn in 1920, thus officially the first demonetisation drive. The Nizam issued Re 1 and Rs 5 banknotes in 1919. Later, he issued Rs 1,000 banknote in 1926. The withdrawn currency was kept in the royal treasury and destroyed in March 1939. However, about 8,500 notes remained with the public. Waterlow, which had the contract to print money, had printed two crore notes. During transit, 608 notes were stolen in Bombay. The government destroyed 20.92 lakh notes which were in circulation. Another 1,78,98,642 notes, which were not issued, were also destroyed, Amarbir said, adding that while five notes were kept as souvenirs in the mint, 245 were preserved in the central treasury of the Nizam. He said soon after the Nizam government destroyed Re 1 notes, World War II began in September 1939, once again creating shortage of metal, and the need to reintroduce Re 1 note arose. Security press at Nasik turned down the request to print Re 1notes citing circumstances beyond its control. This led to the birth of ‘made in Hyderabad’ Re 1 as the new notes were printed at government press in Malakpet. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Indian economy experienced abrupt slowdown in 2019, but it's not in a recession: IMF - Times of India","WASHINGTON: The Indian economy experienced some abrupt slowdown in 2019 due to turbulence in non-banking financial institutions and major reform measures such as GST and demonetisation, but it is not in a recession, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva has said. ""The Indian economy indeed has experienced an abrupt slowdown in 2019. We had to revise our growth projections, downwards to four percent for last year. We are expecting 5.8 per cent (growth rate) in 2020 and then an upward trajectory to 6.5 percent in 2021,"" Georgieva told a group of foreign journalists here on Friday. ""It appears that the main reason for this slowdown was the non-banking financial institutions experiencing a turbulence,"" she said on the eve of Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presenting the annual budget in Parliament on Saturday. She said India had undertaken some important reforms that over the longer term would be beneficial for the country, but they do have some short-term impact. livebudget updatesmoreupdates""For example, coming with the unified tax system, and the demonetisation that took place. These are steps that over time are beneficial, but of course they might, might be somewhat disruptive over short term,"" Georgieva said in response to a question. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director said that there is not a lot of fiscal space in India. ""But we also recognise that the policies of the government on that side, on the fiscal side have been prudent. We will see how the reading of the budget, the submission of the budget goes, tomorrow,"" she said. In the medium-term, she said, the IMF remains optimistic about India. ""This is why we see that upswing potential for the growth in the country,"" she said. Georgieva said that the current economic slowdown cannot be described as a recession. ""No.... You're far from that. But it is a significant slowdown, not the recession,"" she said. The IMF managing Director noted that the consumption in India also slowed down and that contributed to the overall slowdown in the economy. The IMF would be keen to see what India does to get relatively sound macroeconomic fundamentals to pay off in terms of better growth trajectory, she said ahead of the budget. One thing that is important for India is that budgetary revenue have been below target. ""The country knows that. The finance minister knows it. They need to increase budgetary revenue collection so they can improve their fiscal position. I said it's tight on the spending side, but I also want to stress that there is room to improve collection on the revenue side,"" she said.

"Three years after note ban, ‘deposits’ continue in temple hundis | Mysuru News - Times of India","MYSURU: Three years after demonetisation, scrapped currency notes of 500 and 1,000 denomination continue to pour into temple donation boxes, including at Chamundeshwari and Srikanteshwara in Nanjangud, some 26km from Mysuru. Temple functionaries said the hundis are opened once a month and they continue to find bundles of demonetised notes offered by devotees. All the demonetised notes received through hundis are being preserved and government authorities have been informed, they said. The Srikanteshwara temple received 55 notes of 500 denomination and about eight notes of 1,000 denomination early this week. The Chamundeshwari temple hundi has accumulated invalid notes with a face value of Rs 12,000. Officials said though the notes were scrapped in December 2016, there has been no let-up in the flow to hundis since. “We have sought the government’s directions on how to dispose of these notes since there is no specific protocol so far,” said Muzrai tahsildar Yathiraj. “There are 19 hundis in Chamundeshwari temple alone and we continue to receive demonetised notes from all these boxes. Notes with a face value of Rs 15,000 were retrieved earlier,” said Govindraju, an official. Venkatachalpathy, lead bank manager of Mysuru district, said the notes could be destroyed as they are just bits of paper now. “It is an offence to possess more than two demonetised notes. Banks won’t take the notes either since they are worthless so they can be destroyed,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Nepal hopes India will take back demonetised notes worth Rs 7 crore | India News - Times of India,"KATHMANDU: Nepal's Central Bank is saddled with Rs 7 crore of demonetised Indian currency but India is not making ""adjustments"" to take back the notes, Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said on Friday, hoping the scrapped notes would be accepted by its neighbour. The Indian government on November 8, 2016 announced the ban on old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes to curb black money in the system. ""Around INR 7 crore (demonetised currency) is deposited in our Central Bank. It went through the banking channel, I don't know why India is not making adjustment (in the matter),"" Gyawali said. Demonetisation caught Bhutan and Nepal off guard where Indian currency is widely used. ""We are not talking about the money which was transacted through the informal channels but it was through the banking channel. So I am requesting the Indian side to think about this pending issue,"" Gyawali said. Of the Rs 15.41 lakh crore worth Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in circulation on November 8, 99.3 per cent or notes worth Rs 15.31 lakh crore have returned to the banking system.

"Demonetisation: Three years after notebandi, ‘corrupt’ jewellers face heat | India Business News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Armed with data, tax authorities have cracked the whip on jewellers who made huge cash deposits post demonetisation in 2016 but could not explain how they generated so much money when they were showing low income in their tax returns. Sample this: A jeweller, who had disclosed income of under Rs 1.2 lakh, deposited Rs 4.1 crore cash in just three days. In another case, cash deposits during two days added up to nearly Rs 3.3 crore when the taxable income was under Rs 2.7 lakh. In yet another case, a jeweller with income of Rs 54 lakh deposited over Rs 2.5 crore cash. While most jewellers were unable to explain the source of cash, an analysis by the income tax department showed that many jewellers under scrutiny failed to report the deposits in their returns for assessment year 2017-18 (financial year 2016-17), officials told TOI. The tax department also looked at the utility bills of some of these jewellers and found that in one case, where the business shot up to a few crores, the electricity bill was less than Rs 1,500. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesThere were other aspects too which suggested it was not business as usual. A jeweller in Gujarat, for instance, had deposited Rs 4.1 crore cash from November 8, 2016, when demonetisation was announced, and December 30, 2016. But bank records accessed by the tax department showed that the businessman had only deposited Rs 44,260 during the corresponding period in 2015. In many cases, jewellers sought to pass off the funds as unsecured loans. So, in one case, the deposits were of the order of Rs 52 crore while the tax return showed an income of Rs 3.2 crore. An official said the jeweller had only Rs 2.6 lakh as cash in hand on November 11, 2015, but it shot up to Rs 6.2 crore a year later. “There was no satisfactory explanation for the 238-fold increase,” an officer said. While the records showed the cash as proceeds of purchases by unregistered dealers or individuals, during scrutiny many jewellers could not furnish complete bills. There were many jewellers who had shown cash advances of under Rs 20,000 from unknown customers, which were deposited into the bank account only to be returned later. A jeweller, who had reported an annual income of Rs 26 lakh, claimed to have received Rs 9.6 crore as cash advances from 573 persons between November 5 and 8, 2016. But when asked, he could not furnish addresses or contact numbers of these people. Many jewellers who had made large cash deposits told tax authorities that due to the Uri strike and Indo-Pak tension, people opted for gold and silver purchases as they are perceived as safer investment bets. “The fact is that Uri strikes were made in September 2016 and no such discernible pattern of advance receipts was noticed in the case of other jewellers,” the officer said.

Quartet who used demonetised notes to cheat duo held | Bengaluru News - Times of India,"Bengaluru: Four people who allegedly cheated a cabbie and his cousin by claiming they could get demonetised currency notes sold to people who would deposit them with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have been arrested. Banned notes with a face value of Rs 1 crore have been recovered from them. Rajendra Prasad alias Rajendra, 49, of KR Puram, Suresh Kumar alias Suresh, 40, of Wilson Garden, Shanawas, 45, of Adugodi and Sathish K, 40, of Deepanjalinagar, were arrested after cab driver DM Nagaraju, 52, of Bagalur Cross near Yelahanka filed a complaint against the quartet and alleged they’d cheated him and his cousin. Preliminary probe revealed Rajendra befriended Nagaraju at an Indira Canteen in Malleswaram in the first week of November 2019. He kept in touch with him and gained his confidence. He told Nagaraju he could help him make money by trading in demonetised currency. According to Nagaraju, Rajendra told him he knew people in possession of demonetised currency who were ready to sell it at 10% the face value and also those who would buy it at a higher price and exchange it with RBI. “Rajendra stage-managed a deal where an acquaintance sold Nagaraju banned notes with a face value of Rs 1 lakh for Rs 10,000 and arranged for another man to pick them up for Rs 15,000 the next day. Thinking he could make easy money in this business, Nagaraju came on board,” a police officer said. Nagaraju contacted his cousin Rajanna SD and the duo decided to invest. They arranged for Rs 5 lakh each and purchased banned notes with Rs 1 crore face value (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations) on January 16. Rajendra promised to get them sold in three days. The fraudsters met Nagaraju and Rajanna at Hebbal on Monday and collected the notes, saying they would contact them soon. But the quartet didn’t return and their mobiles remained switched off. Nagaraju realised they had been cheated and knocked on the doors of Hebbal police. A team headed by inspector Ashwatha Gowda J and sub-inspector Rajesh VM swung into action and arrested the four men. “We seized the demonetised currency from the accused. They claim to have collected it from a man in Kerala. We are questioning them about others involved in the fraud,” a police officer said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Income tax department lets ‘deserving’ assessees to pay up 20% tax demand in parts - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 21, 2020)MUMBAI: What does the taxman do when the money market dries up and businesses struggle? It tries to figure out a way to inch towards a punishing tax target that the government has set by giving a little breathing space to companies and businesses — the prime taxpayers. Mumbai, which accounts for the highest contribution to income tax in the country, is trying it out. Amid tight liquidity and a tough business environment, tax commissioners in the financial capital decided on Monday to allow “deserving” assessees pay in instalments the amount they are required to fork out after challenging a tax demand order. After receiving a demand order from the assessing officer of the Income Tax (I-T) department, a tax payer has to pay 20% of the demand within a month once the order is challenged before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), the first appellate authority. This amount can now be paid in multiple instalments till end March. livebudget updatesmoreupdates“However, this will be on a case to case basis and is not part of any rule. Instructions have gone out to commissioners in Mumbai to consider genuine requests from assesses so that don’t have to pay the entire 20% at one go. The payments can happen in three or five or six instalments, depending on the case,” a senior tax officer told ET. The tax demands pertain to assessment year 2017-18 (or, the financial year 2016-17 when the Narendra Modi government demonetised all Rs 500 and 1000 rupee currency notes). A flurry of notices, raising tax demand, were issued by the I-T department before December 31, 2019 when assessments for FY 2016-17 became time-barred. The department questioned the authenticity of deals that resulted in surge in cash deposits with banks following demonetisation of currency bills. “This is a small relief given liquidity positions of assesses. No revenue is being sacrificed,” said the official. While tax officials said this might not have been the first time that payments in instalments were permitted, tax professionals felt that the department appeared a little considerate this year — probably due to a sluggish growth in demand. The 20% payment rule on challenging a tax order is in accordance with the guideline of the Central Board of Direct Taxes and not part of a statute. While the ruling on the appeal before the Commissioner of IT (CIT) Appeals may take a long time to come, the 20% payment has to happen soon after a month. “Assessees may try to buy some time by first writing to the assessing officer (AO). Once the AO rejects the application, which typically happens immediately, the assessee can move the principal commissioner followed by the chief commissioner. Normally, if an application is pending before a higher authority, the lower authority will take any action. But such applications within the tax administration may help the taxpayer delay the 20% payment by only a few weeks.. While some feel that the department may be offering an instalment mechanism to save time, I feel it is primarily driven by the present business climate,” said a tax practitioner.

Daily wage labourer gets Rs 1 crore tax notice for demonetisation deposits | Thane News - Times of India,"KALYAN: A labourer from Kalyan, Bhausaheb Ahire (35), who earns Rs 300 as daily wages and stays in a slum, has received a notice from the Income-Tax department asking him to pay Rs 1.05 crore as tax for the money that was “deposited” in his bank account during demonetisation. Ahire recently approached the police saying fraudsters had created a fake bank account in his name using forged documents. Police have ordered a probe into his complaint. The I-T department has been keeping tabs on cash deposits at the time of demonetisation that took place in November 2016 and found that Ahire had deposited Rs58 lakh in a private bank. The notice came as a shocker to Ahire, his family as well as neighbours who knew of his financial condition. Ahire lives with his wife Poonam (32), two daughters Jiya (8) and Riya (5) and son Aarush (3) in a 100 sq ft room owned by his father-in-law in a slum in Galegaon in Ambivli. Ahire, who hails from Osmanabad district, has been residing here for the last six years. Ahire said he had received a notice from the I-T department on September 5 last year seeking explanation on a Rs58 lakh deposit in his account maintained by a private bank.

He approached the Thane rural superintendent of police Shivaji Rathod, demanding action against the fraudsters. Acting on Ahire’s complaint, Rathod has ordered Titwala police to probe the matter.

My conscience doesn't allow me to be silent anymore"" I, @GirishNaught, refuse to be associated with those among family and friends who are actively or silently supporti… https://t.co/Ne32RY7PYN— Girish (@GirishNaught) 1578343201000The Nasik-based stock trader says the message was his way of taking a stand, something he had been considering for a while but was compelled to finally do after reading a college friend's violent response to the JNU incident. ""It makes a statement that if you want to debate, you have to listen to what I say,"" says Girish, 37, who has stopped talking to almost half of his close friends in the last few years because of political differences. ""The Jamia and JNU episodes and the disinformation digested by everyone triggered me. I believe that this has to be challenged in a personal arena, such as family and friends WhatsApp groups, to be effective."" In the wake of the ongoing public protests over CAA and NRC in the last few weeks, political divides among family members, friends and acquaintances have often grown stronger, some even hitting the headlines: In December, cricketer Saurav Ganguly said daughter Sana was ""too young to know about anything in politics"", after she shared an excerpt from Khushwant Singh's book 'The End of India' on her personal Instagram account. In Uttar Pradesh, the DGP tweeted that parents should counsel their children amid ongoing protests. ""Most people on Twitter can't say what they say on the platform in front of families and friends because of fear that it may sound 'extremist'. Often in middle-class families, no one is confrontational but I feel we are at a tipping point now,"" Girish says. ""There has to be dialogue and this has to be inside the family."" Himanish Ganjoo, who is pursuing a PhD in the US, was recently shocked to find out that a close relative called him a terrorist for not supporting the current government. Ganjoo first felt friction with his family over politics in 2014, which was accentuated after he went to study at JNU in 2016. ""I was aghast when I heard Islamophobic chatter my drawing room. I started voicing my opposition but they didn't listen,"" Ganjoo, 26, says. ""Now I think it's futile arguing with them."" Ganjoo has opted out of all family WhatsApp groups and says he no longer talks to his family about politics when he's at home in Delhi. ""It is not just a political debate but what they feel about the idea of India and the people who inhabit India with you -- that's the straw which breaks the camel's back,"" he says. ""Once you realise that people harbour hatred inside them, it casts doubt on the bond you have with them and what kind of people they really are."" The political is getting more and more personal for many of us, says Delhi-based communications consultant Surekha Pillai. ""No longer are we leaving politics behind while entering certain spheres of life,"" she says. ""Politics follows us everywhere from the boardroom to the bowling alley to the cafe to the bedroom. In such a politically charged environment, it can be expected that this intense engagement can cause rifts between people holding varied opinions, especially with a stark divide."" For some, this alienation from one's family can have adverse mental health consequences. Delhi-based theatre artiste Renu* (name changed on request) had to block her brother-in-law on all social media platforms after he began verbally abusing her for being critical of the government. The resulting arguments affected her mental health, leading to several nervous breakdowns and suicidal feelings. ""He was.pushing me into depression with his abusive and controlling behaviour,"" she says. ""He started telling my sister that I was 'anti-national' and in bad company."" Renu also had to cut off contact with a friend who she knew for 10 years after he defended the Kathua rape accused. Now Renu has created a separate Facebook profile for her family and childhood friends, and a second one through which she expresses her real views. She attends protests without telling her family, often hiding her face with a mask to protect her identity. ""I am a closeted person politically and have to make sure my family is not aware of my social media presence,"" she says. Yet, even the polarisation among family and friends grows sharper, there are also stories of friendship and solidarity with people who encounter each other on social media or at protests. Renu was able to find support in a community of like-minded people on social media. ""I come from a conservative background, and am grateful to having learnt so much about my own upper caste privilege, and the struggles of minorities from them,"" she says. Pillai points out that alienation is not the way forward. ""If one is abusive, the other is condescending. If one is remaining silent on violence, the other is constantly pushing them to a corner. None of this is a sign of a healthy democracy which needs vibrant discussions and divergent views to flourish. ideological control seems to have replaced robust debates."" Though she has been attending the ongoing CAA-NRC protests all by herself in the last few weeks, Pillai says she's met several people at protests who inspired her ""with their work and involvement with the protests""' and who she has stayed in touch with. ""My first detention partners were two fierce and fearless people who are part of citizen groups that have been tirelessly working to support protestors with medical, legal and financial support,"" she recalls. During my visit to Shaheen Bagh, I met Shaunak, an art curator who continued to stay there for days, engaging the children with art and helping them imagine and creatively express their idea of India. I also met Hena, a local who sits up all night every night at the protest, who became my source of information on all things Shaheen Bagh."" The anxieties and apprehension of attending a protest alone also led her to send a series of tweets offering to accompany single women who wanted to attend protests in Delhi but had concerns such as safety on their mind. Several women got in touch, ranging from a young student to a middle-aged government employee who later took her took her teenage daughter and friend to protests at Jamia Millia Islamia university. ""The idea was to just get them familiarised with these spaces to help them rid of their reluctance and apprehension of the unknown, for them to be able to engage and explore them on their own."" Mumbai-based Pratyancha Patodkar has been taking food, medicines, water and other supplies to protests in the city, which often acts an an ice-breaker with others attending. ""While I went alone, in some of the people I met the venues, I've found a safe space to share what is going on and what I'm feeling,"" says Patodkar, 25. ""Amidst all the creative sloganeering and naarebaazi, I felt accepted and part of a community, and realised that there are many others who are willing to raise their voice and get on the streets to make a difference."" She continues to stay in touch with the people she's befriended at the protests, sharing information and articles. In Mumbai, freelance journalist Raksha Kumar is trying to bridge the gap through a unique social experiement. In December, she put out a call for a face-to-face dialogue on CAA and NRC on Twitter, inviting strangers to come with one friend with an opposing viewpoint. Kumar says the idea was to speak to people outside one's echo chambers and delve into the nuances that often get lost. Nearly 14 people responded, including couples, parents and children and students. ""It was pretty clear that we are divided into our binaries and our compartmentalised existence, depending on the ideology of the people around you and which socio-economic background we come from,"" Kumar says. ""Social media often amplifies extremes, but when you're sitting across someone, your arguments are more tempered."" The discussion extended to demonetisation and Aadhaar, after which the participants exchanged numbers and followed each other on Twitter, which Kumar says is a step forward. She hosted another such event Bengaluru in January, with a lawyer and a mental health professional she met on Twitter. ""Cutting out distant relatives is easy, it doesn't affect your social circle or mental well-being,"" she says. ""But what if your brother, sister or wife feel differently? These are difficult questions, unless you engage with them and understand where they stand."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Gujarat: Demonetisation back to haunt jewellers | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: The ghosts of demonetisation have returned to haunt jewellers in Gujarat, as the income tax (I-T) department has asked about a thousand of them to pay tax on cash deposits they made between November 8, 2016 and December 30, 2016. The tax demand has been raised for the assessment year 2016-17 through assessment orders (AOs) issued by the I-T department. Each jeweller is being made liable to pay taxes ranging from Rs 2 crore to Rs 50 crore, according to estimates by Jewellers' Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). The AOs issued by the I-T department to these jewellers have classified the income of the jewellers as being from undisclosed sources. ""The high incidence of cash deposits in old currency notes during the demonetisation period is suspicious and it was observed that cash in hand increased before the declaration of demonetization and books of account were manipulated,"" states one such AO, a copy of which TOI has accessed. Jewellers opposed the I-T department move saying that their income and deposits are substantiated by proper bills and cannot be classified as coming from undisclosed sources. Most jewellers who received AOs in the last week of December, had received show-cause notices from the I-T department between September and December. ""We have responded to all such notices and furnished bills for every transaction. Therefore, our income cannot be classified as undisclosed. Moreover, when notices were issued to us, the department sought PAN data and proof of residence of customers who had bought gold. When there was no rule to seek proof of residence or even PAN data, there is no basis for the department to seek these details. We will not be able to furnish it,"" said a senior member of the JAA. Jewellers also raised concerns about having to pay hefty fines during slowdown over such 'baseless' allegations. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 IAF flew 625 tonnes of new notes post-demonetisation: Former air chief Dhanoa | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Post-demonetisation in 2016, the Indian Air Force flew 625 tonnes of new currency in 33 air sorties across the country to various destinations. This little-known aspect of demonetisation was revealed by former IAF chief B S Dhanoa while speaking at the IIT-B’s annual Techfest on Saturday. Dhanoa mentioned this while highlighting some of the unknown roles of the IAF. He said the air force has risen to the occasion during natural disasters like floods and earthquakes. Dhanoa regretted that indigenisation has not fructified as much as one wished for. He said IAF has to depend upon 32 diverse platforms from nine different countries. At the same time, he said if the defence procurement procedure was politicised, “the whole system will become backward”. “Slowing down defence procurement will affect India,” Dhanoa said. According to him, when the Balakot strike was approved, the government sent a political message to Pakistan that henceforth acts of terrorism will come with a heavy price. “The Pulwama attack made the government change its strategy with regards to the response to terrorist attacks,” he told the huge gathering. According to him, the IAF needs to modernise in order to provide a credible deterrence. The IAF has identified 18 projects in the current financial year under the technology development fund.

"‘Demonetisation, GST no ground to delay realty projects’ | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Economic slowdown due to demonetisation and introduction of GST cannot be a ground for delaying completion of housing projects by real estate companies, National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission held while directing Noida developer Mahagun to refund over Rs 50 crore to 29 homebuyers. The homebuyers booked flats in 2013 and the company — Nexgen Infracon Pvt Ltd — had promised to hand over possession by February 2016. It, however, failed to complete the Mahagun Mezzaria project even two years after the stipulated period and the homebuyers, who deposited over Rs 1 crore each, approached the commission in 2018. The company, however, contended the project was delayed because of various factors, such as demonetisation in 2016 and GST in 2017, beyond its control. It said payment to labourers was also hampered. But the commission said the homebuyers couldn’t be made to wait indefinitely. Allowing the plea of the homebuyers’ lawyer, Aditya Parolia, it directed the firm to refund the money along with compensation at 12% annual interest. NCDRC president Justice R K Agrawal said, “Wherever the builder commits a particular date... they must necessarily honour the commitment, though a minor delay may not constitute deficiency in the service.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Chennai: Jewellers in a fix as income tax issues notices on deposits after demonetisation | Chennai News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: The income tax department has issued recovery notices to at least 100 big and small jewellers in Tamil Nadu for cash deposits of demonetized notes made on November 10, 11 and 12 of 2016. The notices have been issued to all big and middle-level jewellers, mostly in Chennai and Coimbatore, based on the returns they filed and the deposits they made in various banks. The jewellers have been asked to pay 20% of the total tax dues immediately and the remaining amount within 30 days. ""Jewellers are facing problems in paying taxes as sales have been down for the past few months,"" Madras Jewellers and Diamond Merchants Association president Jayanthilal J Challani told TOI. After March 2017, jewellers submitted returns and since then, there have been queries from the I-T department.  ""It is based on the returns filed that we have asked jewellers to appear before us and explain the source of income and the deposits made after demonetisation. It is a routine notice which has been issued,"" said a senior I-T official, seeking anonymity. As per the Income Tax Act, even if an assessee wants to appeal against the demand notice, he has to pay 20% of the total demand. ""We have been receiving notices from the income tax department in the last one month asking us to pay the amount,"" said Challani. The association is yet to decide on approaching finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman for some relief. ""It is the timing that has put us in a fix. Sales have plummeted due to economic slowdown,"" said Challani. ""We are facing problems with regard to working finances. Some of us will have to pay not less than 80 crore within 30 days,"" he said. There was a mad rush to jewellery shops soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetization of high-value 500 and 1,000 currency notes.  ""There was a ban on jewellers to receive old notes past midnight on November 9. But some went ahead and received the banned notes even the following day,"" said the senior I-T officer. ""Though it is more than three years since demonetisation came into force, we completed the assessment of the returns filed by several jewellers recently and issued notices,"" said the officer. ""There were searches in some jewellery shops and residences of jewellers after we received information that they had accepted the banned currencies between November 8 and December 31, 2016,"" he said. I-T sleuths conducted the searches at jewellery shops across Chennai and other TN cities and towns. Soon after demonetization was announced on November 8, there was a bank holiday. ""We had the old currencies based on sales on two days and we all rushed to the banks to deposit them,"" said Challani.  ""Some of us continued to deposit the demonetised currencies even on November 11 and 12. This led to doubts that all the money deposited was unaccounted for,"" he said.

" Rahul Gandhi slams government over NPR, NRC; says it will be more disastrous than demonetisation | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Attacking the government over the issue of the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said these exercises will be more disastrous than demonetisation in November 2016. The basic idea of these exercises is to ask all poor people whether they are Indian or not, he told reporters on the sidelines of the flag-hoisting ceremony at the AICC headquarters here on the occasion of   135th foundation day   of the party. ""His (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) 15 friends will not have to show any document and the money generated will go into the pockets of those 15 people,"" he said. Gandhi has previously accused the government of working for select few ""crony capitalists"". ""This will be more disastrous for the people then demonetisation. This will have twice the impact of demonetisation,"" he said. On the BJP calling him a ""liar"", Gandhi again attacked Modi over his remarks that there were no detention centres in the country.

You would have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech in which he is saying there are no detention centres in India and you would have seen the video of the detention centre. You can decide who is lying,"" he told reporters. On Thursday, Gandhi had attacked Modi over his remarks that there were no detention centres in the country, alleging that ""RSS's   Prime Minister lies to Bharat Mata   "". Taking to Twitter, he had also attached a video clip in which Modi accused the Congress, its allies and ""urban Naxals"" of spreading the rumour that Muslims will be sent to detention centres.

" Demonetization, NRC &amp; NPR like taxes on poor people: Rahul Gandhi | India News - Times of India","RAIPUR: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision on National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was similar to that of demonetization which was not less than ""tax on poor people of the country."" Rahul was responding to reporters here on the Centre's claim that the NPR has no link with NRC. ""Be it NRC or NPR, they are like taxes imposed on poor people of India. Demonetization in 2016 has also been like a tax on them because they are charged for depositing and withdrawing money everytime they go to banks. NRC and NPR are similar, poor people will approach officers for updation of documents and they will be forced to pay a bribe to get their job done. They will have to pay money to get a small mistake corrected. Isn’t it attack on poor?” asked Gandhi. “Such a wastage of time it is, Gandhi pointed out repeating that during demonetization when farmers, labourers and poor gave out their money, Modi ji gave a lump sum amount of Rs 3.5 lakh crore to select 15 business tycoons, thus, the economy in our country plunged. Nobody is buying anything and factories are getting shut. This is simple economics to understand. It seems PM is not able to understand it,” Gandhi explained. He appealed that people should ask the Centre why the country’s economy was being ruined. “There was a time when India and China were the competitors for their economic growth but now the situation is completely different. Although the economy earlier grew at nine per cent, it has now declined to four per cent, that too if measured through a new technique. But if we measure the growth rate through the old method, then it will just be 2.50 per cent,"" he said. “Women are not feeling safe when they step out of the house, unemployment is the last priority, violence is at peak and Modi ji is unable to decipher what has caused economy plunge.

 Nation can never benefit if brothers are made to fight each other: Rahul Gandhi | India News - Times of India,"RAIPUR: On the inaugural ceremony of Chhattisgarh's first National Tribal Dance Festival, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday asserted that a country's economy cannot run unless the voice of every person reaches the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha. He added that a country will never benefit when brothers are made to fight among themselves. On the backdrop of protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), Rahul said, ""Nothing can be made by breaking things and no country will ever benefit if brothers are made to fight with brothers. Nothing can be made without taking along people of all religions, castes, classes and tribes. A country's economy cannot run without bringing them all together"". The Congress leader said that unless the voices of these people are heard in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha, unemployment and economy can't be solved because a nation's economy is run majorly by farmers, labourers and the poor. ""If the country's money is given to a handful of people, demonetisation is enforced and GST is implementated, economy of this country will never run smooth nor will the problem of unemployment solve. The government in Chhattisgarh is moving ahead with farmers, youth, women and tribals hand-in-hand. We can see the difference. The economy of Chhattisgarh is progressing at a pace and is much ahead of other states in the country,"" Rahul added. This platform of tribal dance has been organised with an aim to give space to all to display and share their culture and history and it sends out a message of unity in diversity, said the former Congress president.

The granny, R Kamalammal, 92, has been saving the money for more than two decades, one of her family members said. Due to old age, she was unable to remember the amount of money she had even saved. When TOI contacted her on Wednesday, Kamalammmal was unable to say when she had started to save the money and what she had intended to do with it.

She had tied the notes with strings. My daughters found it when we were moving her almirah,” Gopal said. However, he said, when they had inquired for what she had saved the money, she was unable to answer. “We also tried to tell her that the old currency notes had no value now.

The government had in November 2016 demonetised Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 denominations notes. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesThakur told the House that objectives of demonetisation were flushing out black money, eliminating fake Indian currency, to strike at the root of financing of terrorism and Left-wing extremism, to convert non-formal economy to a formal economy to expand tax base and employment and to give a big boost to digitalisation of payments to make India a less cash economy. According to the reply, notes in circulation (NIC) as on November 4, 2016 were Rs 17,74,187 crore which have now increased to Rs 22,35,648 crore as on December 2, 2019. The NIC had grown at an average growth rate of 14.51 per cent year on year wise since October 2014 till October 2016. At this rate, NIC would have increased to Rs 25,40,253 crore as on December 2, 2019. As actual NIC on November 25, 2019 is only Rs 22,35,648 crore, demonetisation followed by digitalisation and reduction of cash use in informal economy has succeeded in reducing NIC by as much as Rs 3,04,605 crore, it added. As reported by the RBI, 7,62,072 pieces of counterfeit bank notes were detected in the banking system during 2016-17, 5,22,783 pieces in 2017-18 and 317,389 pieces in 2018-19.

The total transaction volume increased from 2,071 crore in 2017-18 to 3,134 crore for 2018-19, which corresponds to a growth rate of 51 per cent.

" 51,000 MP Congress workers to join Bharat Bachao rally | India News - Times of India","BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh Congress on Monday said that 51,000 party workers will join the Bharat Bachao Rally under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi at the Ram Lila Maidan in New Delhi on December 14. Speaking to reporters, state PCC treasurer Govind Goel said, ""From the time BJP-led NDA took over the reins of the Centre, the country's economic and social structure has undergone massive damage. Even constitutional institutions have been adversely affected."" Goel said that about 51,000 enthusiastic party workers and leaders, led by chief minister Kamal Nath, will join the Bharat Bachao rally on Saturday. Special trains, buses and SUVs will take the Congress workers to New Delhi. Sources said that target of 1,000 workers has been set from every district of the state - there are 52 districts. However, more workers are likely to reach from districts closer to the capital mainly from the Gwalior-Chambal and Rewa divisions. ""The Congress party's rally is to save the country from BJP's corruption, widespread unemployment, hunger, economic recession, industrial lock-outs, closing businesses of small traders and increasing offences against women and children,"" Govind Goel said. He argued that ""hurriedly-implemented"" demonetisation, GST and other economic policies of the Narendra Modi-led government has resulted in severe fiscal crisis. ""In our country, people used to be happy eating rotis with onions. Today that same onion is costing Rs 200/ kg,"" the state Congress treasurer said. ""The economic stagnation is fearful as the BJP-led Centre is selling gold from our federal reserves and has withdrawn Rs 1.76 lakh crore from the Reserve Bank. The party that claims that Congress did nothing in 60 years is now preparing to sell PSUs established from the times of Jawaharlal Nehru. There was a time when even sewing machines and needles had to be imported."" Goel added that to have a BSNL sim in one's mobile phone was regarded a status symbol and today, the state-owned telecom company is facing closure. Congress said that along with workers, all cabinet ministers, legislators, state and district level office-bearers, frontal organization members will join the rally in New Delhi.

"Tamil Nadu: Women hit by demonetisation get Rs 1,000 pension | Coimbatore News - Times of India","TIRUPUR: It was not yet another day for K Rangammal, 75, and her younger sister P Rangammal, 72, of Boomalur on Friday. The septuagenarian sisters who were in despair after realising their hard earned and painstakingly saved money over years to the tune of Rs 46,000 was in demonetised currency had some cheerful news. Their long pending demand for old age pension was granted by the district administration. Collector K VIjayakarthikeyan met the elderly women and gave them the good news. The district administration issued orders to provide monthly old age pension (OAP) of Rs 1,000 each to the sisters, besides promising to assist for their medical treatment. The eventful day began with government officials led by Palladam tahsildar waiting for more than one and a half hours in their village to pick them to the collectorate. After the delay caused by a miscommunication, the officials took them in a government vehicle to the collectorate as asked by collector K Vijayakarthikeyan. “It was commendable that the media brought out the predicament of the elderly sisters. We wanted to help them in better way, and so, the district administration decided to provide them OAP, and assistance for medical treatment to especially P Rangammal, who was suffering from tuberculosis,” Vijayakarthikeyan said.  “We had applied for OPA long back. But the petition was pending. After their plight came to light, the district administration has come forward to grant OPA immediately,” A Ramathal, a daughter of K Rangammal, said. Vijayakarthikeyan said there were scores of applications for OAP and he came to know about the petition of the elderly sisters only now. However, the collector told them that it would not be possible to exchange the demonetised notes for new ones. P K Jaganathan, a relative of the elderly women said it would be helpful if the government considered it a special case and exchanged the banned notes. Meanwhile, few other people from Tirupur have also shown interest to help the septuagenarians and provide them financial assistance. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" Opposition attacks government over growth, walks out of Rajya Sabha | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The opposition took on the government over demonetisation, hasty implementation of GST regime, rising unemployment and recent controversies surrounding government data during a debate in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday on the current economic situation in the country. After the debate which saw23 members from both the treasury and opposition benches participating, members of most parties, including Congress, TMC and the Left, staged a walkout as soon as finance minister Nirmala Sithraman started speaking, saying it was a""repeat"" of her budget speech rather than addressing the concerns over the economy. Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu expressed disappointment at the walkout by members as ""discussion time was extended to four hours on the insistence of the opposition"". The opposition's assertion that India is heading towards a deep crisis was countered by BJP members who said it was a cyclical slowdown. Anand Sharma of Congress said the gap between the rich and poor has widened in the past few years and ""wrong decisions of the government like demonetisation and hasty implementation of GST have led to the present slowdown"". Jairam Ramesh, also of Congress, said it was important for the government to acknowledge the reality that for the last eight quarters, GDP growth has declined. He warned the government against ""panic privatisation"" of public sector undertakings (PSUs). Countering opposition charges, BJP member Sudhanshu Trivedi said the opposition's apprehensions reflected ""anti-Modi"" obesssion.

"Tirupur paatis painstakingly save Rs 46,000, but all are demonetized notes | Chennai News - Times of India","TIRUPUR: Two sisters in their seventies in Tirupur district scrimped and saved for more than 10 years to put away Rs 46,000 to use in their old age, for medical treatment and their funeral. They didn’t even tell their families how much they had hidden away. There’s only one problem: all the money is in demonetized currency. The families only recently learned that K Rangammal, 75, and her younger sister, P Thangammal, 72, who live separately in their own houses at Boomalur near Palladum and raised goats for a living had so much squirreled away. Rangammal has seven children and Thangammal six; all are married and settled in different places. About a month ago, Thangammal had to be taken to the Perundurai Government Medical College to get her asthma treated. That’s when she told one of her children that she had some money saved. The family found Rs 24,000 in demonetised currency — four Rs 1,000 notes and the rest Rs 500 notes. She also told them that her sister had money saved too. But Rangammal denied it. It was only when she had to go to a hospital for cataract surgery a few days ago that Rangammal showed her children her ‘treasure’ — Rs 22,000 in demonetised Rs 500 notes. K Selvaraj, a son of Rangammal, told TOI that “When the central government announced demonetisation in November 2016, we told my mother and aunt about it. They replied that they did not have the banned notes. They thought we were lying and trying to find out how much they had saved.”Selvaraj, a construction worker, said his mother and aunt feared the family would take away their money, which they had concealed among their clothes and in earthen pots to use for medical treatment and even to pay for their funeral rites. “My mother and aunt paid no attention when we told them about demonetization. They have no interest in the outside world. For instance, my mother did not install the television set given free by the state government for five years. Later we helped to get it installed.” “We now heard that they earlier tried to use the demonetised notes in some shops in Boomalur, and the shopkeepers told them the notes do not hold any value. For the last one year, they could not graze goats and so they would get money from the children for their expenses. Now all their hard earned money is valueless,” rued Selvaraj.

 Shift in focus from citizens' rights to duties | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In a prominent sign of a possible shift in focus, the 70th anniversary of adoption of the Constitution was marked by President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President N Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Speaker Om Birala emphasising the need for citizens to discharge their duties. Addressing a joint sitting of Parliament on the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, PM Modi said citizens' rights were rightly stressed upon earlier as many had been deprived of justice, but seven decades after Independence, it was now time to focus on their responsibilities as well. ""Let us think about how we can fulfil duties enshrined in our Constitution,"" he said, adding, ""We cannot preserve our rights without fulfilling our responsibilities."" The PM had spoken about the importance of citizens' duties in a recent meeting of Union Council of Ministers. The public articulation of the theme left many wondering about the ""right-to duty"" change of approach. In fact, the sentiment about ""duty"" formed the core of all speeches delivered at the function in the Central Hall, which was boycotted by opposition parties over the political drama in Maharashtra. It was mostly the members of BJP and allies that attended the function along with members of TDP, BSP and BJD. President Kovind quoted Mahatma Gandhi to say, ""The true source of rights is duty. If we all discharge our duties, rights will not be far to seek. If leaving duties unperformed, we run after rights, they escape us like a will-o'-the-wisp."" Naidu said, ""Entitlements come with duties and responsibilities as well. Nation-building cannot be the responsibility of governments alone. Citizens have to play an equally important role."" Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla underlined the importance of duties in the Constitution, saying if citizens turned away from duties and talked only about rights, it would create an imbalance that would impede national development. Importantly, the theme of ""duties"", incorporated in the Constitution during the Emergency, is an important part of nationalism narrative and is reflected in BJP's ""nation first"" plank where citizens are expected to make sacrifices for the country. The ruling party invoked it also during the demonetisation and to justify the decision to fund welfare schemes out of the cess on petroleum products. Recalling that architect of the Constitution, Bhim Rao Ambedkar, had asked people if the country can uphold freedom and democracy, Modi said had he been alive, he would probably have been the happiest. ""Not only did India uphold its virtues but it has also strengthened its democracy and freedom,"" Modi noted. Kovind said Indian democracy is respected globally and participation of women voters was almost equal to that of men in the 17th Lok Sabha elections, noting that election of 78 women as MPs was the highest ever. Modi also made an oblique reference to the Emergency, saying the people had thwarted attempts to target the Constitution. He said November 26 is a happy occasion as India celebrates Constitution Day but it also is a sad reminder of the Mumbai terror attacks. Urging all citizens and parliamentarians to discharge fundamental duties, Birla said, ""If we do so, we would soon be able to create a new India."" ""The Constitution has given us several powers in the form of fundamental rights. However, we must always remember that besides fundamental rights, some fundamental duties have also been specified for us in the Constitution,"" Birla said.

Punjab Congress president coins slogan 'Pardhan Mantri Sahukar hai' | Ludhiana News - Times of India,"LUDHIANA: Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Kumar Jakhar on Friday levelled serious charges against Union government during a dharna organised by Congress party against BJP at mini secretariat. Accusing the BJP government of being the biggest threat for the Indian economy, Jakhar alleged that the Union government is wilfully ignoring the interests of the government departments, institutions and is instead promoting big corporate houses. Besides this BJP has caused huge damage to the backbone of Indian economy by implementing GST and demonetisation, due to which the residents are suffering. Jakhar also coined new slogan of ""Pardhan Mantri Sahukar hai"" and also urged all Congress leaders and workers to help him make it viral. Addressing the congress leaders and workers Jakhar said, ""UPA government under the leadership of former prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh had worked hard to stabilise the Indian economy. But ever since the BJP led NDA formed government at Centre, it has destabilised the Indian economy to an extent that it would take ages to stabilise it. Union government has been providing undue benefit to a select big corporate houses and experimenting with the economy and illegal benefits of more than Rs 130,000 crores have been provided to such corporate houses by this government. On the other hand government undertakings such as BSNL, Indian Oil, BPCL etc are being targeted wilfully by the BJP government so that the select corporate houses are benefitted. Even after knowing that if these institutions shut down, lakhs of workers would become jobless, the union government is showing no mercy” Jakhar also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised 2 crore jobs for unemployed each year, while on the other hand, he is formulating such policies that the already the people employed in government sector are finding it difficult to save their jobs. Jakhar also added that to check the menace of stubble burning, the Union government should also come forward to help the farmers financially. Jakhar said that the Supreme Court of India has directed an additional compensation of Rs 100 per quintal for farmers who do not burn paddy stubble. He said that the Union government should share this additional financial burden of Rs 1700 crore if they actually want to help the farmers. He also said that it is wrong to state that the Punjabi farmers are responsible for causing air pollution. He appealed to all office bearers and workers of Congress party to educate the masses about the anti-people policies of the BJP led Union government.

3 years of Demonetisation: How will India remember demonetisation? | India Business News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: ""The magnitude of cash in circulation is directly linked to the level of corruption,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in his speech on 8 November 2016 that declared that all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes (86% of the currency in circulation then) would no longer be legal tender. While demonetisation did bring down cash usage, it was only temporarily. The total currency in circulation has surpassed pre-demonetisation levels (over Rs 22 trillion compared to Rs 17.7 trillion). Black money is in the bank? Over 99% of all the demonetised currency notes had returned to the banking system after the drastic move. RBI board that gave its approval for demonetisation had said: ""Most of the black money is held not in cash but in the form of real sector assets such as gold or real estate and this move would not have a material impact on the assets."" Fake currency hasn't gone: The RBI board had also said that counterfeiting wasn't a big issue: ""While any incidence of counterfeiting is a concern, Rs 400 crore as a percentage of the total quantum of currency in circulation is not very significant."" The fake new design notes of Rs 500 grew the fastest in 2018-19. The government has stopped printing the Rs 2,000 notes introduced after demonetisation, apparently to prevent easy hoarding and because high-quality fakes have appeared in the market. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesDigital march has plateaued: While digital and card payments rose sharply following demonetisation, the growth in number of digital and card transactions is now growing at pre-demonetisation rates. There's also no evidence to suggest that terror funding or corruption has come down because of demonetisation. And we have a slowdown: While lowering its GDP growth forecast in August, rating agency Crisil had the following reasons behind the current economic slowdown: It started with demonetisation (in November 2016), dealing a severe blow to consumption, leading to a vicious cycle of job loss and lower income, which led to further drop in demand. Next shock came in the form of GST (in July 2017), which had a knock-on effect on exports growth because of delay in refunds to exporters. Just as the effects of DeMo and GST were petering out, the IL&FS crisis triggered the NBFC credit crunch in 2018. At the same time, monetary policy was focused on inflation control, which ensured interest rates remained hard. The government too had little wiggle room to increase its spending to pump-prime the economy given the fiscal deficit target. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."
 'Financial emergency' looms due to 'wrong' govt policies: Congress | India News - Times of India,"INDORE: The country is being pushed towards ""financial emergency"" because of the Centre's ""wrong"" economic policies, the Congress said on Thursday. Even three years after the demonetisation exercise, the country is still facing its after-effects, the party said on the eve of the Modi government's November 8, 2016 decision to scrap high-value notes. Congress MP and national spokesman P L Punia said the central government opted out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement due to pressure mounted by the party and other opposition outfits. ""The decision of demonetisation was taken without any thought and the country is facing its after-effects even today,"" he said. Punia hit out at the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi over its economic policies. ""The government kept on taking wrong decisions on the economic front and is pushing the country towards financial emergency, he told reporters at the Indore Press Club. He claimed the government was set to sign the RCEP agreement by compromising on the nations interest, but because of strong opposition from the Congress and other opposition parties, it was forced to retreat. ""China says it will try to convince India to sign the RCEP. It is a matter of concern. If India inks this pact, then import of cheaper goods from China will jeopardise small and medium industries of the country, he said. To a question on the extradition of diamond trader Nirav Modi, a key accused in the multi-crore PNB scam case, to India from the UK, Punia said this query should be posed to the central government in view of his latest statement. If Nirav Modi is saying that in the event of being extradited to India from Britain, he will commit suicide, then it would be better if this question is asked to the central government and the BJP,"" the Congress spokesman said. Punia alleged Nirav Modi is close to big persons in the BJP who, he claimed, were involved in ensuring his escape from the country just before the $2 billion PNB scam came to light. The Congress MP, however, did not identify these big persons. Nirav Modi, arrested by the UK police in March 2019, is currently lodged in a London jail. Asked about the delay in formation of a government in Maharashtra, where the BJP and the Shiv Sena are locked in a power-sharing tussle, Punia said the governor should explore available alternatives. If the BJP and the Shiv Sena are unable to form a government in Maharashtra, then it is the duty of the governor to ensure formation of government by trying available alternatives,"" he said.

 Sonia Gandhi slams govt on 'dilution' of historic RTI Act | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said the Modi government's amendments to the RTI Act to ""dilute the powers of the information commissioners"" were a ""final assault"" on the historic legislation that has empowered the common man. Referring to the amendments, Sonia said they would ensure that no information commissioner was free from interference and from signals from the government. ""We have opposed these amendments in Parliament and will continue to oppose them in practice. We condemn this piecemeal destruction of our democratic institutions and will continue to fight the Modi government in these self-serving actions which are the very opposite of national interest,"" she said in a statement released on Thursday morning. While slamming the BJP regime, Sonia said the RTI law is a historic legislation which has created an institution that has in 13 years become a ""sentinel of democracy, transparency and accountability to the common man"". She said RTI activists across the country have used the law to tackle corruption, to measure the effectiveness of government policies and to illuminate the deficiencies in processes such as demonetisation and elections. In contrast, she said the Modi government has seen this remarkable institution as an obstacle to enforcing its majoritarian agenda without being held accountable to people. ""The BJP government has now launched its final assault to decimate RTI. To further erode and dilute its effectiveness, the Modi government has passed amendments which diminish the office of the information commissioner in a manner that it leaves them at the mercy of the very government it is required to hold accountable,"" she said.

 Shiv Sena on economic slowdown: 'Itna sannata kyon hai bhai'? | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Monday borrowed an iconic dialogue from Hindi blockbuster movie 'Sholay' to target the Centre over the economic slowdown, seeking to know why there was so much ""silence"" in markets on the occasion of Diwali and wondered if worse days were ahead. ""...Itna sannata kyon hai bhai?"" (why is there so much silence) is the question resonating everywhere on ""silence"" over the future of the country and Maharashtra, the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'. In the film 'Sholay', the dialogue was mouthed by veteran actor late A K Hangal in an emotional scene where silent villagers look on while a horse carries the body of his son killed by dacoit Gabbar Singh, portrayed by Amjad Khan. The Sena used the famous dialogue to raise questions over what it termed as the ""gloomy"" picture of the economy, and blamed the government's decisions of demonetisation and ""faulty implementation"" of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for the present situation in the country. ""Markets have lost shine as sales figures have dropped by 30 to 40 per cent due to the looming fear of slowdown. Industries are suffering while some manufacturing units have closed down, leading to joblessness,"" it said. Several banks are facing financial crisis and people have no money to spend, the Marathi publication said. ""On the other hand, the government is also forced to draw funds from the RBI's reserves. There is silence in markets on Diwali, but foreign companies, through online shopping platforms, have been filling up their coffers with the country's money,"" it rued. Farmers were the worst hit as their crops, which were ready to be harvested, were damaged due to the untimely rains recently, the editorial pointed out. ""Unfortunately, nobody talks about how to bring farmers out of this,"" said the Sena, which is an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra. There was less clamour and ""more silence"" during the state assembly polls held on the eve of Diwali, it claimed. As the BJP's tally went down in the state polls held last week compared to its 2014 performance, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray raised a pitch for ""equal sharing"" of power. Last week, he demanded a written assurance from the BJP for implementing ""equal formula for sharing of power"", before holding talks on staking the claim to form the next alliance government in the state. In the recent polls to 288-member Assembly, the BJP won 105 seats, a loss of 17 seats compared to its 2014 tally. The Sena's tally also came down to 60 seats from 63 in 2014.

Critic of Modi govt's policies and performance wins Economics Nobel - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: Indian-American economist Abhijit Banerjee, a critic of some of the BJP government's policies and performance, will share the 2019 Nobel Prize in economic sciences with his colleague and wife Esther Duflo and fellow researcher Michael Kramer for their work on poverty research. ""The research conducted by this year's Laureates has considerably improved our ability to fight global poverty. In just two decades, their new experiment-based approach has transformed development economics, which is now a flourishing field of research,"" the Nobel Prize Committee said in its announcement on Monday of the $ 1.1 million prize. Currently the Ford Foundation International professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Banerjee and Duflo are best known for antipoverty research emphasizing the use of field experiments to bring the principles of laboratory-style randomized, controlled trials to empirical economics. MIT said they have studied a wide range of topics implicated in global poverty, including health care provision, education, agriculture, and gender attitudes, while developing new antipoverty programmes based on their research. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesIn 2003, Duflo and Banerjee (along with Sendhil Mullainathan, also from India and now of the University of Chicago) co-founded the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), a global network of antipoverty researchers that conducts field experiments. J-PAL works to both discern which kinds of local interventions have the greatest impact on social problems, and to implement those programmes in cooperation with governments and NGOs. Among J-PAL's notable interventions are deworming programmes that have been adopted widely. Much of Banerjee's work centres on economic policies and research relating to India, particularly in the field of microfinance and financial inclusion. He was among the advisors to the Congress on its Nyuntam Aay Yojana (Nyay scheme), proposed ahead of 2019 general elections, which pledged to distribute cash to 20 per cent of India's poorest families as a minimum guarantee programme. A known critic of the some of the NDA/BJP/RSS dispensation's economic prescriptions, Banerjee, who is also an alumnus of Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), took a dim view of the Modi government's demonetisation move and the GST implementation, and has cited them among reasons for India's economic slowdown.

"Quota, not GST or Demonetization, set to test traders’ loyalty towards BJP | Nagpur News - Times of India","Nagpur: Businessmen here who are mainly from Marwari, Gujarati, Sindhi and Punjabi communities have traditionally been BJP voters. The party, which is assured to get their votes, will be harping on moves like ease of business, freedom from inspector raj and also that much of GST procedures have been streamlined. Businessmen, who admit that they may still vote for BJP, also said that more than the state of economy, the issue of reservation may affect their sentiments as voters. A section of traders TOI talked to said a number of businessmen had taken part in the ‘Save Merit Save Nation’ movement against increasing caste-based quota in medical colleges. Wards of many businessmen are also aspiring to take up higher education and reservation can come in their way. Due to their leaning towards BJP, they may not vote for any other party but businessmen may also press the none of the above (NOTA) button, they said. Chandan Goswami of BJP’s traders’ cell said issues like note ban and GST are now a thing of past. There may be some concerns about the economic slowdown, but it would not have any impact on the votes. “Micro-level meetings will be held in various localities where businessmen will be briefed about how hassles related to GST have been now resolved, besides other moves like ease of business and early tax refund. The communities which businessmen come from are traditionally BJP voters,” he said. Nitin Khandelwal, a bullion trader from Akola, said the slowdown has left its impact but there is a bigger resentment over reservation. A number of businessmen in the region have been part of the ‘Save Merit Save Nation’ campaign. This may ultimately have an impact on their votes. As they requested anonymity, businessmen said they may prefer to push the NOTA button over the reservation issue. Sanjay Agarawal from Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC) said professionals, industrialists and traders took part in large numbers in the campaign. “Many of our wards want to take up education and become doctors. It’s not BJP alone; we are unhappy with all the parties over the issue,” he said Sanjay Puniyani, treasurer in NVCC, also confirmed of a simmering discontent among businessmen. Julfesh Shah, a chartered accountant, said messages are doing rounds prompting the voters to go for NOTA. Dipen Shah, president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), said reservations may not be an issue any more as businessmen are satisfied after the government decided to increase the number of seats along with the quota. “The measures announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will only help the corporates. Hopes that the turnover limit for mandatory audit would be hiked have not been met. The slump cannot be denied and the sentiment is damp, but businessmen may still prefer BJP as they find no other choice,” said Nilesh Suchak, former president of NVCC.

Demonetisation fraud: Four-year jail for three bank officers | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In what could be the first-ever conviction in a case of unlawful gains during demonetisation, a special CBI court on Friday awarded four-year jail term to three Punjab National Bank officials and observed that their actions “left a slur on the institution” in which they had grown. Special CBI judge Raj Kumar Chauhan said the trio, being bank officials, were expected to be on a “higher pedestal” of “honesty” and “integrity”. It said: “This seems to be a classical case of misuse of power by the bank officials after demonetisation.” The three officials — Rama Nand Gupta, Bhuvnesh Kumar Julka and Jeetander Veer Arora — were held guilty of falsely showing deposited legal tender notes of Rs 10.5 lakh as demonetised currency and exchanging it “unauthorisedly and illegally”.

The lawmaker asserted that the move is going to affect the credibility of India in the United Nations and other Muslim countries.

Demonetization exposed myth of fake currency: Bombay HC | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: While frowning on Reserve Bank of India’s frequent resizing of currency notes, the Bombay high court on Thursday said demonetization exposed the myth of fake currency in circulation. “You keep saying fake currency. Where is fake currency? Demonetization showed that it was a myth that Pakistan took away Rs 10,000 crore. I don’t think so,” said Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog. Along with Justice Nitin Jamdar, he heard a public interest litigation filed by National Association for the Blind (NAB) to make currency notes and coins friendly for the visually challenged. The judge’s oral observations followed the Union government advocate Uma Wagle’s statement that new coins introduced in March now contain distinct features accessible to the blind. The judges then questioned the frequent changes to currency notes. “You keep changing the size of notes— Rs 50, 10, 20 and even 100 have undergone a change,” said the Chief Justice. The judges pointed out that the world over, sizes of notes remain the same. “The dollar continues to be the same. You (RBI) keep redesigning the currency,” the CJ remarked. The bench said there are special tactile features on the notes for the blind and if the sizes change, it would cause them problems. “At least the size should be the same,” the CJ added. The judges also questioned what was the compulsion to change the size of notes. They said it cannot be said that this is being done to do away with fake currency. They then referred to the demonetization of 2016, saying it exposed the myth of fake currency. The bench said RBI must exercise powers in such a way that no one is inconvenienced. Referring to its earlier replies, RBI’s advocate Dhaval Patil said before making changes, the apex bank takes advice from various organizations of blind persons. In their order, the judges said, “RBI shall file a further affidavit stating what is the compulsion of RBI to change the features of notes from time to time.” Also, “What is the compulsion of RBI to change the size of the notes.” NAB advocate Uday Warunjikar said a mobile software was demonstrated to identify notes on the previous date of hearing. “Sometimes it worked and it was also not working,” he said. The judges again lamented changing of features of the notes. “What is the need to do it? World over, there is no changing of features,” said the CJ.

The proposed mobile app would be able to identify the denomination of notes of Mahatma Gandhi Series and Mahatma Gandhi (New) series by capturing the image of the notes placed in front of mobile camera, the RBI said while inviting bids from tech firms to develop the app. The RBI had come out with a similar 'request for proposal' from vendors but later cancelled it. The app will also generate ""audio notification"" intimating the currency note denomination to the user if image is captured correctly, else intimating the user to try again in case of image is not readable. There are about 80 lakh blind or visually impaired people in the country, who are likely to benefit from the initiative of the central bank. In June, 2018 the central bank had declared that it would explore the feasibility of developing a suitable device or mechanism for aiding the visually impaired in the identification of Indian banknotes.

Budget 2019: India’s wealthy get demonetised again | India Business News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In the last few years, there’s been a buzz about the possible imposition of an inheritance tax. But instead of going down that road, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman decided to increase the levy on rich taxpayers, leaving the liability of others unchanged. Under the new tax regime, those with income between Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 crore will pay tax at the rate of 39%, and those earning more than Rs 5 crore will have to pay tax at a whopping 42.74%. This is more than the US, where the maximum rate is 37%, which triggers over an income of $600,000 (Rs 4 crore approx). Though the tax slabs haven’t changed officially, rates have — because a tax surcharge of 25% has been imposed when income is between Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 crore. If income exceeds Rs 5 crore, the surcharge on tax is 37%. Besides this, there is a health and education cess of 4%, which will continue to be levied on income tax, including surcharge. Are you paying more, or less, tax than 5 years ago?livebudget updatesmoreupdatesThere are around 10,000 taxpayers in the Rs 2 crore income bracket. Tax rates on incomes below Rs 2 crore have been left unchanged. In the interim budget, individual taxpayers having taxable annual income up to Rs 5 lakh were given full tax rebate and, therefore, not required to pay any income tax. However, they will have to continue to file tax returns. The provision cost the exchequer Rs 18,500 crore. The interim budget had also increased the standard deduction from Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000, costing the government Rs 4,700 crore. Union Budget 2019: Are you richer or poorer? Here's the bottomlineBut on Friday, the FM did not dole out any bonanza to its taxpayers. Income between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh will continue to attract tax at 20% and cess of 4%. In the highest tax bracket of 30% for incomes up to Rs 50 lakh, there is no surcharge, but cess at 4%. But when income crosses Rs 50 lakh, a surcharge of 10% will be levied up to income of Rs 1 crore. Income between Rs 1 crore and Rs 2 crore will continue to attract a surcharge of 15%. The enhanced tax liability, including surcharge, will be levied on the entire income once the threshold is crossed and not on the income above the threshold level only. For instance, if a person’s income is even Rs 5,000 above Rs 50 lakh, he or she crosses the threshold, and tax liability increases by the surcharge of 10% on the entire tax. But the tax liability will not be more than the additional income, which is Rs 5,000 in this case.

Nirmala Sitharaman: Demonetisation had no effect on Indian economy | India Business News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India still continues to be the fastest growing economy and demonetisation has had no effect on the economy, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. The minister, while responding to supplementaries during the Question Hour, said the manufacturing sector has had a certain fall, but it is not attributable to demonetisation. She said economic growth is high on the agenda of the government and various reforms are being undertaken in many spheres to improve GDP growth. Sitharaman said the moderation in growth momentum in 2018-19 is primarily on account of lower growth in 'Agriculture and allied', 'trade, hotel, transport, storage, communication and services related to broadcasting' and 'public administration and defence' sectors,"" she said. livebudget updatesmoreupdates""If the impact of low growth in certain sectors has impacted growth rate, particularly in agriculture and allied activities as also in financial and real estate and professional services, there has been a fall, particularly in agriculture based on third advance estimates, it is believed that there has been a 0.6 per cent decline in the output. ""If the impact on the low growth is because of outcomes from these sectors, the manufacturing sector has had a certain fall but which is not attributable to demonetisation,"" the minister said. She said in the last quarter, there could have been a fall and steps have been taken to improve the economy. ""But, we are still the fastest growing economy,"" she said. Sitharaman said if the United States' growth has grown between 1.6, 2.2, 2.9 and 2.3 per cent in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, and China's growth has also decelerated from 6.7, 6.8, 6.6 and 6.3 per cent, India is still well above 7 per cent at 7.3 per cent growth.

The minister said as regards steps taken, the government has taken several steps in order that more money goes to people and that is why the PM's Kisan Samman Yojna, the Pension Yojna, where money goes directly through DBT into the people's hands, are activities through which people are getting the benefit. ""Over and above that, in order that institutions will have to extend more credit facilities for industry and for those entrepreneurs in the ground, the credit situation and also taking care of resolutional stressed assets through banks is also happening,"" she said.

India lags most countries in reducing cheque use - Times of India,"MUMBAI: India lags other countries in the shift to a more efficient electronic payment system from a costly cheque clearance. One reason for this is that a relatively lower number of people use the direct debit option to make recurrent payments and instead issue cheques every month. A report by the RBI, which compares the country’s advancement in payment systems with others on various parameters, has identified several areas where India is in a weak spot. This includes per capita number of card swipe machines, the availability of a common card for transportation, share of debit and credit cards in payment systems. Despite having a high level of cash, the ATM penetration in India is still lower than in other countries. One area where the country has made progress is reducing dependency on cash. India had a high cash in circulation at 12% of gross domestic product (GDP) with only Japan and Hong Kong being higher. Demonetisation and an active growth in GDP brought down the active cash in circulation as a percentage of GDP to 8.7% in 2016 which increased to 10.7% in 2017. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesThe report said that in most countries cheques have disappeared or are dying a slow death. India’s cheque volume declined by 10.8% between 2012 and 2017 at a compounded annual growth rate of -2% — the second slowest after Turkey. The US and Brazil, which had a higher volume of cheques in 2012, showed a sharper decline. “In India, the year-on-year growth in 2016 was 10%, which can be attributed to demonetisation where all modes of payment showed an increase. However, 2017 saw a small decline of 2.9% over the previous year,” the RBI said. Ironically, India’s failure to move people away from cheques is also attributed to its success in cheque handling. India has an efficient T+1 settlement system (cheques are cleared in a day) and cheques processing is mechanised. Standardisation of cheque forms and cheque truncation system (CTS) enable the clearing to be done using an image of the cheque rather than moving it physically. On the positive side, India is ahead of others in payment laws, regulation, customer safety and authentication standards. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."
"ED attaches Rs 150 crore worth jewellery, Telangana HC refuses to interfere | Hyderabad News - Times of India","HYDERABAD: In a huge setback to Mussaddilal Jewellers that was facing criminal cases for its alleged unlawful activities immediately after demonetisation, the Telangana high court has refused to release the gold jewellery worth Rs 150 crore attached by the enforcement directorate (ED) on one hand and also declined to interfere in the summons issued by the ED officials to the directors of Mussaddilal and its sister concerns. The directors of these firms Nitin Gupta, Nikhil Gupta and Kailash Chand Gupta filed an application urging the court to suspend the summons issued to them by the ED officials. Their counsel told the court that the officials have already filed their chargesheet under provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and hence calling them again in the name of probe is illegal. More over the ED did not confine itself to the attachment of the assets related to Mussaddilal Jewellers, it also attached assets of unconnected firms, the counsel said. K Lakshman, assistant solicitor general argued the case of the ED and said that Mussaddilal has three firms and all three of them are being run by father and sons of the same family. There is a legal nexus between them and the ED officials could trace inter bank transfer of money among these three firms. If they have any grievance over the orders passed by the ED officials, the jewellers have got an alternative remedy under the Act. They can go to the adjudicating authority in Delhi under PMLA. If high court intervene and give relief to the accused, then the job of the adjudicating authority would become meaningless, the ASG said. We have identified Rs 111 crore as proceeds of crime in this case, he added.

PM Modi locked up entire cabinet before demonetisation: Rahul - Times of India,"SHIMLA: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi got his entire cabinet “locked up” before announcing his decision to demonetise high-value currency notes. Addressing a rally in Himachal Pradesh's Solan, Gandhi claimed he was given this information by members of the Special Protection Group (SPG), the agency which guards him. ""During demonetisation Narendra Modi put his cabinet under lock and key (“taley se band kiya thha) on Race Course Road,” he said, referring to the earlier name of the road on which the PM's official residence is located. “This the truth,” Gandhi said. “The SPG people provide me also with security. They told me that do you know that the prime minister of India locked up his entire cabinet,” he said. He also criticised Modi over the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). ""Countrymen say Modi committed mistakes by implementing demonetisation and the GST. But Modi will never admit it,"" he said. The small and medium industrialists, traders and unemployed youth were adversely affected by demonetisation and GST, he added. Rahul Gandhi also dared Narendra Modi to a debate, saying he has just ""four questions"" to ask which the prime minister will not be able to answer. ""I am ready to engage in a debate with Modi on corruption at any place,"" he said. ""Give me 15 minutes, I will ask only four questions. And Modi may take three-four hours to answer them. He will not be able to show his face to the citizens of the country after the debate,"" he added. Reiterating his allegations of corruption in the Rafale fighter jet contract, Rahul Gandhi said the government struck an overpriced deal for the jets to benefit industrialist Anil Ambani. The charge has been repeatedly denied by the government and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Gandhi also ridiculed Modi over his reported remark that he felt the cloud cover on the day IAF struck Balakot will help the fighter aircraft evade Pakistan's radars. ""Modi keeps hiding his knowledge and does not hold any press conference while I talk to the media every other day,"" he said. The Congress leader also accused Modi of not fulfilling his poll promises of providing jobs and ""depositing Rs 15 lakh"" in the bank account of every citizen.

Demonetisation was a ""scam"" that ran into hundreds and thousands of crores and responsibilities needed to be fixed for it, Tewari said here. The Anandpur Sahib Lok Sabha constituency in Punjab goes to polls on May 19 in the last leg of the seven-phase parliamentary elections. ""Demonetisation was not only a huge financial scam, it was like brutal murder of the economy and responsibility needs to be fixed for it and those guilty brought to book,"" he said. ""The Congress party's government at the Centre will set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the demonetisation scam,"" Tewari said. Congress president Rahul Gandhi, in his poll rallies, have been targeting the Modi government over demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax, claiming that these two decisions ""destroyed"" the economy. Tewari further dubbed the decision of demonetisation as ""arbitrary and dictatorial"" that hit every section of the society. He said the move ""destroyed"" the livelihood of hundreds and thousands of people across the country, and as such, it needed to be probed.

PM Modi should have taken Manmohan's advice before demonetisation: Rahul - Times of India,"BARGARI (PUNJAB): Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday contrasted Manmohan Singh who led the UPA government and Narendra Modi, saying the Prime Minister wouldn't have “destroyed” the economy if he had taken advice from his predecessor. “Modi used to make fun of Manmohan Singh. But after five years now, Modi ji does not make fun of Manmohan ji. Today the country is making fun of him,” Gandhi said at an election rally here. Accusing Modi of “destroying” the economy with his two decisions, he said had the PM taken the advice of Manmohan Singh he would not have rolled out demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Gandhi referred to it as the Gabbar Singh Tax. He claimed that the former PM had rightly predicted a fall of two percentage points in the country's GDP due to demonetisation. The Congress leader targeted Modi for likening the country's economy under the Manmohan Singh as “sleeping elephant”, and asked where he was when the hard-working Punjab farmers ushered in the green revolution. Modi has often called the Manmohan Singh government as one run by remote control, suggesting that UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi was the one who wielded real power. During this election campaign, Manmohan Singh has hit back through media interviews. At the rally in Faridkot district's Bargari town, Rahul Gandhi also attacked the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP government in Punjab over the 2015 desecration of religious texts, which still remains an emotive issue in the state.

Demonetisation &amp; GST no dampener for Patna traders - Times of India,"PATNA: Much against general perception, demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime appeared to have no bearing on the voting behaviour of the trade and business sections in the Patna Sahib parliamentary constituency. PM Narendra Modi had announced demonetisation of the then high-value currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 on November 8, 2016, causing immediate cash scarcity in the country that disrupted the economy and also led to removal of people from jobs, or voluntary cessation of work in various kinds of trade activities, including in the informal sector that accounted for around 54% of the economy. On the other hand, introduction of GST regime and rearrangement of various kinds of taxes in five tax slabs a year later on July 1, 2017 had also led to additional burden on the trade, business and industry circles, resulting in further confusion, including in the job market that caused unemployment. However, over the last two to three years, the business and trade circles have seemingly overcome the initial disturbances caused in the economy. “There had been hiccups, like the cash crunch caused by the demonetisation. Similarly, problems related to GST had been taken up by the GST Council. The hiccups have largely eased out,” Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) secretary general Amit Mukherjee said. “It must be counted as pluses on the side of the central government. The trading and business classes have been the traditional supporters of the BJP,” he added. Indeed, the gold and silver jewellery market in Patna and other parts of the state had been acutely concerned about the new tax regime. Patliputra Sarrafa Sangh (PSS) president Vinod Kumar said the jewellers in state had also joined the countrywide 42-day stir to make the Centre take notice of their demands. The jewellers wanted 3% GST on the gold and silver jewellery and freedom from e-way bill for transporting jewellery from one place to another, as people in the sector had been traditionally transporting their items from one place to another either through courier services or by hand for security reasons. “The GST Council finally addressed our two concerns,” Kumar said. He said the traders engaged in the gold and jewellery sector would vote for BJP’s Patna Sahib candidate Ravi Shankar Prasad. Recalling an incident, Kumar said Ravi Shankar had given patient hearing to the concerns of the jewellers at Patna. “He (Ravi Shankar) told us that he would convey our concerns to the PM,” Kumar said. Indeed, Ravi Shankar has been holding meetings with the representatives of business groups and their caste organisations. Even on Sunday, he held a meeting with the members of the Barnwal Mahasangh in the Kadamkuan locality. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."
Demonetised currency conversion case: ED attaches assets worth Rs 3 crore | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Monday provisionally attached properties worth Rs 2.95 crore belonging to accused in the Axis Bank demonetised currency conversion case. The ED had initiated an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on the basis of an FIR filed by Delhi Police on the seizure of Rs 3.70 crore in the form of demonetised currency notes of Rs 1,000. “Investigation revealed that on the announcement of demonetisation policy, accused Mohit Garg, Nitin Gupta, Vineet Gupta, Shobhit Sinha and Axis Bank officials used shell companies/firms, namely, Beagle Marketing, Sunrise Trading Co, R D Traders and Himalayan Traders of Rajeev Singh Kushwaha for illegal exchange of demonetised currency of Vinod Deshmukh, Puneet Jain, Hemraj Singh, Pravesh Kumar Gandhi and others,” an ED statement said. In 2017, the ED had filed a chargesheet in money laundering cases resulting from demonetisation against officials of an Axis Bank branch in the capital and others for illegal conversion of scrapped currency notes. The agency had named two Axis Bank officials working at the Kashmere Gate branch, Vineet Gupta (branch head) and Shobhit Sinha (operations head), who with “active connivance” of Rajeev Kushwaha deposited “huge amount of demonetised currency to the tune of Rs 40 crore of various firms and companies run by Kushwaha for a huge commission and converted it into monetised form like RTGS transfers and gold”. According to the agency, Mohit Garg, Nitin Gupta and Rajeev Kushwaha collected demonetised currency from different persons and deposited them into the account of shell firms/companies allegedly operated by Kushwaha. “This was done with the help of Axis Bank officials. The amount deposited in these shell companies was further transferred to the account of different bullion traders for buying gold. Thus, they converted demonetised currency into gold/RTGS transfers on commission basis and illegally exchanged demonetised currency into gold,” the ED said. “Investigation also revealed that demonetised currency worth Rs 40 crore of different persons was converted in this manner. Mohit Garg and Rajeev Singh Kushwaha illegally earned a commission at the rate of 15% of the total amount deposited in the account of shell companies/firms.

 HC relief for two for withdrawing Rs 1.2L via cheques during demonetisation | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: In a relief for two Nashik firm executives booked for withdrawing Rs 1.2 lakh from a bank through cheques two days after demonetisation, the Bombay HC has struck down the FIR against them, ruling that continuing the criminal case would be an abuse of the process of law. The CBI’s anti corruption bureau had booked the finance manager and director of Reliable Auto Tech for cheating and criminal breach of trust as they had signed three cheques totalling Rs 1.2 lakh that were submitted to SBI on November 10, 2016. The CBI said they flouted an RBI circular dated November 10, 2016 — two days after demonetisation — which limited cash withdrawal to Rs 10,000 per person and Rs 20,000 per week. A division bench of Justices Ranjit More and Bharati Dangre said, “The allegation... can merely be referred to as ‘absurd’ and would not lead to an inference that the accused persons could be held guilty... Since the allegations... would not finally result in establishing the guilt since the basic ingredient alleged is the dishonest intention.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Rahul alleges PM Modi fosters hatred against Gandhi family - Times of India,"INDORE: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi fosters hatred against the Gandhi family and said that he would continue to hug the PM as hate could only be defeated by love. ""There is hatred in the hearts of BJP, RSS and Narendra Modi. Our job is to remove it,"" Gandhi said addressing a poll rally in Shujalpur area in favour of Congress' Dewas Lok Sabha seat candidate Prahlad Tipaniya. ""Narendra Modi attacks me, speaks with hatred and anger about my father, my grandmother and my great grandfather, but I go and give them a ' jhappi' (hug). You are a prime minister ... entire strength of country is behind you. You must remove hatred and work with love,"" he said adding ""Hatred can not be ended with hatred. It can only be conquered with love."" He also said the ongoing election was a fight between two ideologies- that of the Congress, and of the BJP and the RSS on the other. Continuing his tirade against BJP, he said Modi did not listen to farmers, traders and public but heard what Nirav Modi and the Ambanis said. Rahul Gandhi accused the Prime Minister for not keeping his promises made to the public during the 2014 polls including providing jobs to 2 crore youth, remunerative prices for farmers' produce and Rs 15 lakh into the bank accounts of every citizen. ""For Modi his promise of giving Rs 15 lakh into the bank accounts of every citizen was a myth but we got an idea from this and will give Rs 72,000 per annum to 5 crore women of the country,"" he said. Congress president said the money will boost the purchasing capacities of the people, aid industries in resuming trade and eventually help youths in getting the jobs. ""Modi killed the purchasing capacity of the people by rolling out GST and demonetisation.

Dispute over demonetised currencies suspected behind Maoist attack | Patna News - Times of India,"PATNA: The attack on house of a jeweller at Malaypur in Jamui district on Tuesday night is suspected to be fallout of dispute between him and Maoists over demonetised currencies, according to police sources. The jeweller Rajkumar Sao (44) and his daughter Nikki Kumari (18) were shot at after a contingent of heavily armed Maoist attacked and barged inside jeweller’s residence at around 10pm on Tuesday. Maoists fled after looting valuables from his residence. Sao owns Manorama Jewellers located around two kilometres from his residence. A senior IPS officer, privy to investigation made till now in the case, told TOI preferring anonymity that police came to know that Sao was handed over around Rs 15 lakh in demonetized currency by Maoists after demonetization on November 8, 2016. “He was given the task to get the currencies exchanged. However, he returned only half of total amount given to him by Maoists,” he said. “Maoists were pressuring Sao to return rest of the amount since several months which he did not complied with. Finally they attacked his residence with motive to loot gold ornament. However, they could take away valuables worth around hardly Rs 1.5 lakh,” he said. Meanwhile, Special Task Force SP (Operation) Ranjit Kumar Mishra, after visiting the spot on Thursday said that the girl had received altogether four gunshot injuries including one in lower abdomen while Sao received one gunshot injury on his right hand. “At least five shots were fired by Maoist inside residence. There are bullet marks on ceiling. Prima facie it seem that while Sao received direct gunshot injury, Nikki received injuries from bullets which had ricochet from ceiling. Due to it, even after being a small room, one of the bullets was stuck inside her abdomen,” he said adding combing operation was going on in the area with help of CoBRA commandos of CRPF. Mishra said intelligence input indicates CPI (Maoist) area commander Baleshwar Korha had ordered the attack and a cadre led by Arjun Korha had executed it. Earlier, Maoist had alleged BJP MLC Rajan Kumar for not returning Rs 5 crore which was handed over to him after demonetization for exchange. A massive attack took place at his residence at Sudi Bigha under Deo police station area in Aurangabad in which his uncle was shot dead and 11 vehicles were torched on night of December 29 last year.

Narendra Modi: Rajiv Gandhi used INS Viraat as taxi for family vacation | - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday accused the late Rajiv Gandhi of using India's premier warship, INS Viraat, as his ""personal taxi"" to go for a vacation to a special island with his family friends when he was PM. Modi was addressing a mammoth election rally at Ramlila Maidan. Modi alleged the naval vessel had been deployed to secure the maritime boundary when it was recalled and made to serve the Gandhi family for 10 days. He added that an IAF helicopter and other government paraphernalia were also put at the service of the family during that period. The allegation followed Modi's charge that Rajiv Gandhi had died as ""corrupt number one"". Modi made the charge after he claimed he was often ""abused"" and told the defence forces were not his ""personal property"". Those who ask for votes in the name of their ancestors get rattled when someone talks about their deeds, PM Narendra Modi said at a rally in the capital on Wednesday. ""Have you ever heard of anyone going on a family vacation on a naval warship? This has happened in our own country. The 'naamdaar' Congress family used INS Viraat as its personal taxi and insulted it,"" Modi alleged. ""Not only was the Gandhi family picked up by INS Viraat and taken to a special island, but the warship also stayed with them for 10 days. Rajiv Gandhi was accompanied by his in-laws who had come from Italy. The question is whether the security of the country was not compromised by taking foreigners on board a warship,"" he asked. The warship was decommissioned in 2017. According to a report in India Today, the island was Bangaram in the Lakshwadeep archipelago. Among those who joined the then Prime Minister and his family on this trip in December 1987 were Sonia Gandhi's sister, brother-in-law and their children, her mother, four friends of Rahul and Priyanka, and actor Amitabh Bachchan, his wife, Jaya, and their children. The daughter of Amitabh's brother, Ajitabh, had also travelled with them. Taking a jibe at the Congress's election slogan of 'Nyay', Modi said the party should also talk about giving justice to the families of the victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. He charged the Congress with making an accused in those riots the chief minister of a state. ""We are trying to undo all the wrong deeds of the Congress governments. It is the first time that the perpetrators of the anti-Sikh riots have been put behind bars and are facing the gallows,"" said the Prime Minister amid loud cheers from thousands of people. Reacting to the allegations, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said: ""Unfortunately, this PM has become desperate because of certain defeat staring him in the face. An official trip on INS Virat by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is distorted by the current PM 28 years after his demise. Does this not show his absolute despair and does he forget the joyride he took on a seaplane in Gujarat? What is the relevance of such cheap comments for development issues - jobs, agricultural distress, demonetisation and MSMEs? Obviously, no answer being available on those issues results in such low-level comments about the dead.""

'Dilli ki beti' Priyanka Gandhi attacks 'outsider' PM Modi - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Throwing an open challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked him to fight the last phases of the Lok Sabha elections on the issues of demonetisation, Goods and Services Tax and women's safety. ""Fight the elections on the false promises you have made,"" she shouted from atop a minibus that took her around in the North East Delhi constituency as part of her roadshow on Wednesday in support of Congress candidate Sheila Dikshit. Priyanka had another roadshow in the evening to canvass votes for Vijender Singh, Congress candidate from South Delhi constituency. At Yamuna Vihar, Priyanka, calling herself Dilli ki beti , referred to the hoardings proclaiming BJP and Modiji were in the hearts of Delhi's people and said, ""I was born in the city and have been living here for 47 years. I know entire Delhi from Majnu Ka Tilla to Mehrauli."" Then she delivered her punchline on the Modi hoardings: ""You live in 7, Lok Kalyan Marg and don't get out of your house. How would you know Delhi?"" The Congress general secretary said that not having done any work in five years, BJP's situation now was ""like those of children who haven't done their homework and tell their teacher, 'Kya karoon, Nehruji ne mera parcha le liya aur chhupa diya. Indiraji ne mere homework ki kashti banake baha diya' (What can I do, Nehruji took my homework and hid it. Indiraji made paper boat out of my homework)"". Dressed in a maroon sari, she worked the big gathering, ""What has he done for you in the last five years? You stood in queues after demonetisation but hasn't black money come back? They promised two crore jobs every year for the youth. Have you got any jobs? Who will make him accountable?"" She also said there was no safety for farmers or for women in the country. The Congress leader said that by exercising their voting right on May 12, they would empower themselves and democracy. ""They want to destroy democracy, so you have to start raising your voice from here because Delhi is the centre. Bring in a government that is accountable,"" she said, adding that her party worked for progress and development, not to divide people. On the course from Brahmpuri in Seelampur, past Muslim-dominated areas till Yamuna Vihar, teeming crowds waited to see Priyanka and Dikshit. Many more crammed the balconies and terraces to catch a glimpse of the star campaigner. Priyanka was showered with rose petals almost throughout the roadshow. Striking a discordant note were a few banners that read, ""Dear Sheilaji, you rejected the alliance, we reject you"", referring to the abortive seat-sharing arrangement between Congress and Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi. Local residents, however, claimed outsiders had put up these banners. Soon after, around Priyanka drove to the slums and JJ clusters of Dakshinpuri in south Delhi, where she had an hour-long roadshow that brought the entire area to a festive halt. It began at 7pm from Virat Cinema and terminated at the Tigri traffic signal on Mehrauli Badarpur road. As the loudspeakers blared, ""Priyanka nahi ye aandhi hai, doosri Indira Gandhi hai (It is not Priyanka, but a storm, an incarnation of Indira Gandhi)"", an elated Girija Devi, 70, commented, ""Her nose is so much like her dadi's. I have seen them both now."" Despite heavy security and SPG protection, Priyanka did not leave her supporters disappointed. At regular intervals, she signalled the security personnel to let some of the supporters take a selfie with her. ""The SUV was moving so she took my phone and clicked a selfie for me instead. I will get it framed,"" gushed Mukesh Gahlot, a Congress worker who had come from Chhatarpur. On several occasions, she directed political newbie Vijender Singh, the candidate there, how to interact with the crowd. Among the poorest areas in the constituency, it has areas all named for Priyanka's family, from Sanjay Camp to Indira Colony. Once a stronghold for the party, the vote shifted to AAP in the assembly elections of 2014 and 2015. Sujata Kumari, a mother of two at Sanjay Camp, said law and order was a prime concern. ""This rally route is so brightly lit today, but it is usually so dark that you hesitate to leave home at night,"" she said. Though Priyanka was supposed to deliver a public address at the Tigri end point, chaos and traffic jams on the arterial Mehrauli-Badarpur Road led to its cancellation and the Congress leader left for her next destination around 8pm. The spectacle covered Ambedkar Nagar and Devli assembly constituencies. Traditionally dominated by the Jat and Gujjar communities, the importance of JJ cluster votes in the fight among Congress, BJP and AAP can be gauged from the fact Delhi chief minister Arvind kejriwal too had canvassed in the locality only a few days ago.

Mastercard to invest $1 billion in India - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Payments company Mastercard has said it will invest an additional $1 billion in India, nearly a third of which will go towards building a payments processing node that goes beyond its commitment to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on storing data in the country. This is in addition to the $1 billion the US giant has already pumped into India in the last five years, a large part of which is for providing technology and back office support to global operations. Speaking to TOI, Mastercard co-president (Asia-Pacific) Ari Sarker said in the last five years, the company has made a fundamental shift in its presence in India. “From 30-odd people in essentially a sales and distribution organisation, we have grown to over 2,000 people here, representing 14% of our global workforce. We have technology centres in Baroda, Pune and Gurgaon,” he said. “Our technology hub is going to see an investment of $300-350 million. We are still working on details of the exact location — my sense is that it will be in Pune and Baroda as we do not want to create new cities,” said Sarker. “The RBI has very clearly said it wants only data localisation and data residency in India. We are going beyond that by creating processing capability in India. And we’re doing that for business-competitive reasons,” said Sarker. “Creation of this global node in India will give us complete flexibility to bring any innovation to India. This is being done with our business-competitive lens on, and not be constrained in bringing new innovations after we are able to replicate everything in the local market,” he said. “Given that it connects to our global network, we will then evaluate how we load balance and move our global traffic so that we can use the India node for other markets as well,” said Sarker. For Mastercard, India is not just about having more of its cards or having more swipe machines. It is also a market where it can deploy its financial infrastructure capability, something which the RBI is looking at opening up for competition to reduce the ‘single-point failure’ risk. Mastercard is one of the largest providers of automated clearing house services and is building an Asia-Pacific hub in Singapore and is looking to provide similar services in India. “Even as we are digesting the notification from the RBI, we are increasing our capability in India,” said Sarker. He said that the new areas including providing service layers on top of payments solutions that will address pain points of micro-merchants and micro-SMEs. Instead of merely enabling payments, it will also facilitate analytics and help small merchants avail credit from banks. Mastercard is already doing high-end technology development locally. “We have a mobile centre of excellence, our artificial intelligence-based analytics capability and we are also working on cybersecurity issues from here,” said Sarker. Mastercard Labs — the R&D arm based in Pune — works with several startups. In the last one year, Mastercard decided to shift focus to smaller, newer companies and provide them access and funding between $250,000 to $2 million. The payments company has invested in startups like Tone Tag and FTcash, and has recently concluded an investment in a company called Signzy. “We are not only investing in fintechs and providing them technology, we are also taking them to our global markets,” said Sarker. On the slowing down of card payments after a spike in demonetisation, Sarker said, “Historically cash has been around 12% of GDP. While cash is back, as a percentage of GDP, it is roughly 10.5%. So I think there clearly has been a momentum shift towards digital, and demonetisation has added that impetus,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."

"Hit by demonetisation, Rewari sees hope in government jobs, new projects - Times of India","REWARI (HARYANA): Once popular as 'peetal nagri' (city of brass), Rewari now has just a handful of big and small businesses dealing in traditional brassware. More than 450 years ago, local ruler Hemu took a cue from the Mughals and started manufacturing brass cannons in this town. However, dipping demand, higher taxes on brass and copper along with the twin jolts of GST and demonetisation have made things tough for traders. A place that sets the political tone for the Gurgaon Lok Sabha seat in Haryana, which goes to the polls on May 12, Rewari covers the two assembly segments of Rewari city and Bawal and has a Union minister, BJP's Rao Inderjit Singh, as its sitting MP. Jobs made available in the (BJP-led) state government and big-ticket announcements, including declaration of an AIIMS in the district along with a medical college, have helped the saffron party convince many voters. ""The recruitment has been fair, and jobs have gone to meritorious candidates. For the first time, many youngsters have got jobs. Earlier, there was only corruption,"" said Surender Singh, a Rewari resident. Not surprisingly, BJP's discourse here is focused on this, with posters and banners claiming ""Merit hi hai naukri ka aadhar, phir ek baar Modi sarkar"". Even though basic infrastructure in the area is still inadequate, residents in villages surrounding Rewari city are relieved because the hold of property dealers has loosened in the past five years, curbing illegal acquisition of farm land. ""Property dealers were powerful in Rewari till about four years ago, and farmers were scared of losing their land as the threat of acquisition was always there. But things have changed,"" Harish, a resident of Sanghwari village said. Rewari is dominated by Yadavs, also known as Ahirs, who constitute around 60% of the electorate. But a large number of Punjabis and Banias, who moved to the city in 1947, now form the nucleus of the trading community. While Rao Inderjit has enjoyed unflinching support from the Yadavs, the Congress has also fielded a strong community leader this time - Captain Ajay Singh Yadav - which may cause a split in Yadav votes. So, Rao Inderjit is also trying to woo the others, particularly Punjabis, among whom his family has had goodwill for years. As for residents, they are worried that though the Bawal and Daruhera regions grew as industrial centres during under UPA, not much has moved since, and there aren't too many private jobs. Another issue is that the Defence University - the foundation stone for which was laid in 2005 in Binola village by Rao Inderjit when he was MoS (defence) in UPA - is yet to kick off. ""The AIIMS announcement is a similar eyewash before elections,"" said Bawal resident Bunty Yadav. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."

Kotak Economic Research in an April 30 report said: ""We are surprised with the decline in income tax e-filing in FY2019."" livebudget updatesmoreupdates""If the filings are indeed plateauing, it will be a worry for the fiscal which has seemingly shifted its focus to compensatory expenditure,"" it said. ""Tax filings have surprisingly plateaued in FY2019. This is surprising given that post demonetisation it was expected that the tax base would continue to increase."" However, registered filers have been on the rise - they grew by 15 per cent to 8.45 crore as on March 31, 2019, the e-filing website showed. Registered filers were just 2.7 crore at the end of March 2013 which almost doubled to 5.2 crore in March 2016 and to 6.2 crore in March 2017. In signs of lower compliance, the ratio of actual filings to registered filers was 79 per cent in FY2018-19, down from 91.6 per cent in the previous fiscal. The compliance ratio was 85 per cent and 83 per cent in the preceding two years. It was 79.3 per cent in FY2014-15, which was a decline from 82 per cent of FY2013-14. The data showed a steady rise in filers in the Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh range with 1.05 crore filings in FY2018-19 including 1.02 crore of individual taxpayers. Kotak said the declining e-filings ""does beg the question whether compliance was weaker in the latter part of FY2019 given that the number of registered filers has continued to see steady growth."" ""If compliance has been weak, the new government will aim at increasing the filings and collections in FY2020,"" it said. ""A focused utilization of the data on deposits during demonetization could yield better compliance, especially in the higher income brackets."" This combined with the granular GST filing data will be essential in increasing the filings as well as revenues over the next few years, it said. ""The task is cut out for the next government looking at improving the tax buoyancy -- essential to fund the increasing transfers in expenditure."" The government needs to look at further expanding the tax base (optimally using the data repository from demonetization and GST). Without a significant improvement in the tax base, the medium-term growth path will be at risk, Kotak said. It said that while it is hoped that the filings for the assessment year increase (around August when filings are completed), a relatively muted tax filing growth will create further headwinds in an already stressed fiscal space. ""With the recent inception of direct transfers in the budget, the fiscal could easily be on a slippery slope unless there is a rationalization of expenditure,"" it said adding around 55 per cent of central government expenditure is fixed in nature and the eventual impact could be on further lowering capex. Given the stressed fiscal space, debt markets are burdened with heavy government and PSE borrowings, which are likely to keep the yield curve steep in FY2020, it added. Kotak said while a number of activity indicators have been signalling a slowdown in parts of the economy, the tax collections corroborate it too. ""Aggregate indirect tax revenues' buoyancy has been weak along with targets being missed on direct taxes too. Further, persistently high borrowing cost for financial institutions and companies (given crowding out by the government sector) will weigh on the near-term aggregate demand in the economy,"" it said. From a medium-term perspective, if the government does not expand its capital expenditure (higher transfers and muted tax growth), the growth prospects will be under doubt given estimated fiscal multipliers, it added.

"GST, demonetisation caused some trouble, but did not shake people's faith in PM: Harsh Vardhan - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Admitting that demonetisation and the implementation of GST by the government had caused ""some disturbances"", Union minister and BJP candidate from Chandni Chowk, Harsh Vardhan, has asserted that the moves have not shaken the people's faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision. In an interview to PTI, Vardhan said these ""bold steps"" of the government were appreciated by people and the criticism was ""politically motivated"". ""When demonetisation was done, certainly it was a very hard, historic reform and a bold decision on the part of the government and of course, our PM Narendra Modiji. You saw the whole country stood in queues outside banks but not even a single person was unhappy because people had faith in the vision of the PM and his intentions. ""Although, for a small period of time, people had some small disturbances in handling cash and going to the banks for changing it. Now everyone has realised that the PM had very pious intentions. Nobody has criticised it,"" the Union minister of science and technology said. Asked about the discomfort caused to businessmen and traders due to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), he described the new tax regime as the ""biggest reform"", which was amended from time to time on the basis of inputs given by traders. ""GST was a major and the biggest reform. The prime minister does everything that benefits people even though, for some time, people may not like it. But after having introduced the GST reforms, he was so receptive and pragmatic in his approach that he took inputs from traders from all sections of the society, their wise suggestions were incorporated and the GST Act was amended 100-200 times,"" Vardhan said. Stating that the criticism of demonetisation and GST was politically motivated, he took a dig at the opposition parties, saying they had run out of issues. ""People in India, Delhi and in my own constituency realise that the PM has very very pure intentions and he is trying to bring about a major change in the country. He is trying to bring about reforms in the thinking of people, whereby truthfulness and honesty in business start prevailing. People have started changing to the newer reform strategy. This (GST) is no longer an issue. ""These issues are being raised because the opposition is devoid of issues. Even if there is some criticism in some quarters, it is all politically motivated,"" the 64-year-old MP from Chandni Chowk said, adding that he had faith in the traders. ""I have full faith in the commitment of the traders. People have so much enthusiasm and commitment for the prime minister, because everybody in this country -- whether a trader, a poor man, a student or a scientist, doctor, farmer or labourer -- realises that the PM has an extraordinary ability and vision,"" Vardhan said. Vardhan had been a four-time MLA from east Delhi's Krishna Nagar Assembly constituency. He had joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1993. In the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, Vardhan is pitted against the Congress's Jai Prakash Agarwal and the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) Pankaj Gupta in the Chandni Chowk constituency.

Why Maoist-hit Gumla is thankful for demonetisation - Times of India,"GUMLA: On the highway lined with sal trees in the southern part of the Chota Nagpur plateau, five years ago, no vehicle would ply after 4pm. Passing through the most affected district in the 'red corridor' of the state, was a risky business. As the government expedited the road building projects under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna and Road Requirement Plan (RRP) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas in Jharkhand, extortion from contractors and transporters working in road construction, bauxite mining, and stone quarries became a major source of income for Maoists. In one such case of extortion in 2013, Shahabuddin, a road construction contractor was killed along with his friend by People's Liberation Front of India (PLFI), an extension of CPI(Maoists), his widow Farida recalls. ""They were shot dead because my husband's friend Wasim bhai, refused to pay,"" says Farida who now feeds and educates her three children by working as a maid. The family lives in a half-built concrete house that Farida's husband was constructing at the time in a narrow lane of Muslim neighborhood in Gumla. PLFI had left behind a pamphlet to claim responsibility for the killings. Though they were killed in Kolibera area of Simdega, another district that was deeply affected by the Maoist violence, Gumla used to be the worst hit. ""Such incidents had caused so much scare since the outbreak of Maoist insurgency that after 4pm, nobody would be seen driving through this highway. But along with aggressive counter-insurgency operations, demonetization broke the back of Maoists in this region,"" claims a driver who works with a Ranchi based cab agency. Now that a majority of them have been wiped out, extortion has also stopped, he adds arguing that this is why no one cribs about demonetisation in the area. Radha, whose husband Sohan Kisan was killed by Maoists in Raidhi Parkhand in 2003, also claims that demonetization hurt Maoists economically. ""We heard that they dumped their notes in the caves in the jungle because they couldn't get it back to the villages and deposit in banks. Their currency was of no use."" Now working as a grade IV employee at a local government office and raising her two children in Gumla town, Radha believes the administration with the help of villagers has been able to defeat Maoists in the region in the last five years. Interestingly, soon after demonetization, massive number of Maoists surrendered and huge amount of currency was seized from them in all the states affected by Naxal violence. Data shows that in Gumla district, the incidents of killings came down from 16 in 2013 to only 1 in 2018 and in overall Jharkhand, it came down from 55 in 2013 to 30 in 2018. A middle-aged woman owner of a dhaba in Basia believes peace in the area has been one of the biggest accomplishments of the Modi government. ""There used to be violence and tension here all the time. Now its normal and one is not scared to run the shop here,"" she says adding that for this reason alone she would vote for the BJP. Gumla is part of the Lohardaga parliamentary constituency which will go to polls on April 29. Though Congress voters admit that the BJP government curbed Maoist violence in the district to a huge extent, they believe it would be a tough contest between Sudarshan Bhagat of the BJP and Sukhdeo Bhagat of the Congress because of the considerable minority vote in the constituency.

Demonetisation spectre looms over Dharavi elections | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: In the sprawling slum of Dharavi, which is home to hundreds of small businesses, note bandi still casts a shadow on the polls. The slum is part of the Mumbai South Central constituency where sitting MP Shiv Sena’s Rahul Shewale takes on Congress’s Eknath Gaikwad. Abdullah Ahad, who ran a luggage business with a turnover of Rs 2 lakh a month, had to shut down for two months after demonetisation. “Even now, my business is almost half of what it once was,” he says, adding that imposition of GST made things more difficult. “I had to stop sending my goods to Mumbai and Gujarat,” says Ahad. The result is that he had to take a massive loan which he is still paying off. Mohmmad Abbas who runs a small garments factory called Ghanchi garments, too, had to shut his unit in 2016. At the time, he had a turnover of Rs 40,000 a month. Now, he makes barely Rs 20,000. “We need a government which allows businesses to function. We cannot have this kind of economic shock,” says Abbas. Moinuddin Khan, who ran a small driving agency, too, said he had to shut. “All the payments got stuck after demonetisation and my business was too small to sustain it. After demonetisation, it was difficult for the job market to recover.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"In 70 years, nobody did anything as foolish as demonetisation, GST: Rahul Gandhi - Times of India","KANPUR/RAE BARELI: Continuing his attack on PM Narendra Modi over demonetisation and GST, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that no one in past 70 years did anything as foolish. Addressing a meeting at Rae Bareli, Rahul said, “In past 70 years, no one did the foolishness of demonetisation and Gabbar Singh Tax.” “Narendra Modi ji ke paas ab bolne ko kuchh bacha nahi hai, isliye woh teleprompter se padhte rehte hain,” Rahul told reporters later. Speaking at public meetings in Gauriganj and Jagdishpur in Amethi constituency, Rahul asked people to recall what Modi said five years ago. “Aapko yaad hai, paanch saal pehle, Modiji ne kya kaha tha, 15 lakh rupay har ek ke khate mai dalenge, magar yeh paisa aapki jeb se chori kar ke Modi chowkidar ne 15 logon ke account mein dale hain (Modi had said that Rs 15 lakh will be deposited in everyone’s account but it was given to 15 people),” he said. Rahul then said, “Chowkidar…,” and prompted the public to say “...chor hai.” Rahul also shared some light moments with sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra at the Chakeri airstrip and jokingly complained about how she gets to travel in big helicopters even when she covers small distances, while he takes small helicopter even if though he travels far. Priyanka countered him smilingly saying, “That’s not true. I have also gone on long flights.” Rahul and Priyanka then hugged each other before boarding their helicopters.

BJP leaders in note exchange scam after demonetisation: Kapil Sibal | Mumbai News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Congress leader and former law minister Kapil Sibal on Saturday alleged that a few government officials and some politicians of the rulingparty were involved in a money exchange scam post the demonetisation deadline. Sibal claimed that some sting operation videos showed those involved in the money exchange scam had asked for a commission of 15 to 40 per cent to exchange old notes with new ones.

'Direct tax collection up since demonetisation' - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Significant rise in direct net tax collections in the year of demonetisation and after, exceptional growth in revenue from advance and self-assessment tax under personal income tax and steady increase in new income tax filers point to positive impact of note ban, official sources said. Even as a political battle rages over demonetisation announced by PM Modi on November 8, 2016, government data show trends of formalisation of the economy and a widening of the tax net, suggesting positives despite the initial shock to the financial system. The revenue growth trends continued in the 2018-19 fiscal, more than two years after demonetisation, with corporate income tax growing at 14% and personal income tax at 13%. Voluntary tax payments under advance tax are also growing at a healthy rate of 14% which, if seen along with increasing digitalisation, points to a cleaner economic system, said sources. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesApart from large cash deposits, there was a significant increase in accounts operated by persons such as domestic workers, artisans and casual labour. As they deposited old currency in banks, their cash became safer than it was when it was stored in tin boxes and under mattresses. Growth trends in the number of income tax returns filed have not slackened and a little over a crore of new filers were added till February this year. The demonetisation year of 2016-17 saw a 29% growth of new income tax filers, accelerating a trend since 2015-16. “A clear upswing in new tax filers can be attributed to higher compliance due to transfer of cash into formal channels as a result of demonetisation,” said a source. The data underlines enforcement actions against black money in the context of demonetisation, with Rs 900 crore seized between November, 2016 to March, 2017. The increase in revenues and returns is seen to have nudged individuals and businesses to adopt more transparent means. “18 lakh cases were identified where cash deposits were not in sync with the returns filed or those who had not filed their returns. Intensive emails and SMSes were sent to them with the result that tax collections have become better,” said the source. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."
"Demonetisation a scam, will be investigated with change of govt: Anand Sharma - Times of India","BHOPAL: Former Union minister and deputy leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma on Saturday said that demonetisation was a scam that will be investigated with change of government. “I charge the Prime Minister that demonetisation was a scam and once the change of government takes place, this scam will be investigated and accountability will be fixed,” he said. Anand Sharma was speaking to reporters here on Saturday afternoon. He was answering PM Modi’s allegation that Congress attacked him over demonetisation because people close to the party were adversely affected by the decision. Addressing the election public meeting in Jabalpur on Friday, the Prime Minister alleged, “Real estate prices fell due to demonetisation affecting people close to the Congress who invested in realty sector. Congress attacked me and launched a campaign showing people in long queues when I started taking action against black money and corruption.” Replying to the PM’s accusation, Congress leader Anand Sharma said, “It was farmers, poor people and small businesses that were destroyed. I had told PM Modi even then that money belongs to the people of India, don’t insult them. India has almost seven lakh villages and while there are 1 lakh 38 thousand branches of public sector banks in the country, 78% of these are in urban areas. It is the farmers, housewives and small traders of the rural areas who do not keep their money in banks and they got were hit by demonetisation.” Anand Sharma argued that those people who lost their lives while standing in the queue were the ones who were affected, girls who committed suicide because they could not get married, and patients who lost their lives because they could not pay hospital bills during demonetisation who were affected. They then charged, “It was the BJP and its leaders who set-up a national project of money laundering during demonetisation. “How come 99.5% of cash reached banks and how? We did not see BJP leaders in the queues and yet so many persons were caught from Mumbai, Gujarat, Lucknow, Kashi (Varanasi) to Bangalore. Take out a list of these persons and see who they are and how many of them are from the BJP. I charge the Prime Minister that demonetisation was a scam.” He said with the change of government at the Centre, demonetisation will be investigated. The Congress leader further said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is responsible for the “monumental mismanagement of the Indian economy.” “Businesses started closing after demonetisation and people lost their jobs. They went back to the villages where only MNREGA helped to feed the crores,” he said. The senior Congress leader said that the economy had not even recovered from the demonetization effect when came another bad decision in the form of GST. “He says GST was a unanimous decision but he spoke to former AICC president Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh only once on it. Congress had said that the highest rate of GST should be 18% and tax slab for commodities used by poor persons should be kept low,” he said. “The GST came with five slabs and no where in the world had it been implemented like this.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."
"Demonetisation, GST on lips, a young Pawar assumes family mantle near Mumbai - Times of India","The schedule has been gruelling for the last month and a half for Parth, one of the mostwatched candidates in the Maharashtra election arena since he is a poll debutant from the Pawar family. Waking up early to a new schedule in a new place, meeting party workers, heading out on long campaigns, speaking at rallies that hundreds attend looking for hope and inspiration, and all the while getting acquainted with the ways of electioneering — this is what Parth Pawar’s days have looked like since campaigning began. The 29-year-old commerce graduate, NCP leader Sharad Pawar’s grand-nephew, has been camping in Maval, the Lok Sabha constituency that stretches from the Elephanta islands in the Arabian Sea off the Mumbai coast to the outskirts of Pune. He is pitted against the formidable Shrirang Barne, the Shiv Sena MP known as a high performer. The battle in Maval is one of experience versus youth, and Parth has taken it up as a challenge. “A strong opponent just gets the best out of you,” he told TOI on Thursday while heading to Uran to conduct smaller sabhas. “I believe Maval’s ground reality is that it needs a drastic leadership change,” he added. On his visit list are villages and places located across Uran, where fishing and agriculture are the primary occupations. After delimitation, the Maval constituency has expanded. Pawar may be rallying in an open-top vehicle on the streets of Wakad in Pune district one day, and may be in a small fishing village in Navi Mumbai on another. “Such is the diversity of the constituency. Travelling has become a part of my routine,” he says. “However, it’s not new for me. I have been visiting such places across the state for party-related work,” he adds. And does such a hectic schedule take a toll on his health? “My fitness regime has gone for a toss. But I try to eat home-cooked food so that my health is maintained,” he says. In Karnala, Parth is constantly surrounded by party loyalists. “People of Maval are like my extended family. I don’t think one needs to be treated differently in a family. It’s by virtue of Pawar saheb (Sharad Pawar) and the people of Maval that I have got this opportunity to contest from here. Affection is a very small word when you consider the trust that people here have shown in me,” he said. As the junior Pawar visits more places and villages, party supporters shout slogans of ‘Ekch vaada, Parth dada’. A crowd, comprising mostly youngsters, follows his convoy as Parth enters the lanes and bylanes of Karade village in the late evening hours. “Given people’s response to our rallies and public gatherings (sabhas), my father (Ajit Pawar) and Pawar saheb are both very optimistic,” says Parth. The talking points of his poll campaign are demonetisation, GST, farmer distress and unemployment. “Everyone is disappointed in the current government. Students don’t get government scholarships on time, there are no jobs for new graduates, farmers are in distress and the demonetisation and faulty implementation of GST have affected all businesses. In the automobile industry, the year 2017-18 saw employment fall by 2.5%, which is significant,” he says. These days, Parth is joined by his aunt Supriya Sule, who is in the race for the Baramati seat. This is a huge relief because he considers Sule his mentor. “My aunt has always been supportive and has been keeping an eye on my progress. I often take advice from her, be it in personal life or political work,” he says, adding once campaigning is over, he would just spend some time thanking party workers for their help.

"Foolishness of demonetisation, 'Gabbar Singh Tax' was not done by anyone in 70 years: Rahul - Times of India","RAE BARELI: Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his strident criticism of the Congress, party president RahulGandhi on Saturday said in the last 70 years, the ""foolishness of demonetisation and Gabbar Singh Tax"" was not done by anybody. ""In the past 70 years, the foolishness of demonetisation and Gabbar Singh Tax ( Gandhi's coinage for the Goods and Services Tax or GST) was not done by anyone,"" RahulGandhi said at an election meeting in Unchahar in Rae Beareli from where UPA chairperson and his mother Sonia Gandhi is seeking reelection to the Lok Sabha.

"Narendra Modi:  PM Modi fires back at opposition, forcefully defends demonetisation - Times of India","JABALPUR: Switching gears after having downplayed demonetisation in his speeches, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday responded to the opposition’s criticism that notebandi hurt the economy, saying he was being targeted as influential people in real estate close to Congress had been hit. “Note ban led to a reduction in house prices, but those close to Congress who had invested in the sector are devastated. Congress is at pains because three lakh companies were sealed following note ban,” the PM said. After having avoided any detailed reference to demonetisation, with the issue not finding any prominence in the BJP manifesto either, Modi joined issue with the opposition and said the gleeful predictions that notebandi will seal the fate of the central government had proved to be misplaced. Modi said a “few people sitting in AC rooms in Delhi” celebrated the decision, saying “Modi’s fate is sealed” but a majority of people had proved them wrong. He said no one blamed him for demonetisation, and calculated that there were about 15 lakh people — assuming five for each of the three lakh companies — who were his “enemies” as their activities had been shut down. The PM kicked off his campaign in Madhya Pradesh with a blistering attack on Congress and accused it of siphoning off funds meant for pregnant women and malnourished children to commit the “Tughlaq Road election scam” — a reference to the recent income tax action involving persons associated with CM Kamal Nath. He alleged the money was being used for the poll campaign of Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. Three days ahead of the first phase of voting in MP, he targeted Rahul in Sidhi and said, “Chowkidar chowkanna hai (the guard is alert). Naamdar and his raagdarbaris, no one will be spared. The law is equal for everyone. If Narendra Modi does anything wrong, raid his house too.” With Congress and BJP locked in a direct contest in a state that gave BJP handsome returns in 2014, the Prime Minister looked to counter the loss in the recent assembly polls by focusing on the income tax raids. “In Congress culture, corruption is the only protocol. Raids conducted by agencies revealed that money collected for food for pregnant women and nutrition for children under government schemes was siphoned off to Tughlaq Road (in Delhi),” he said. Modi said the election scam saw money being routed to Congress’s poll campaign. Canvassing support for BJP candidates for Jabalpur, Mandla and Khajuraho Lok Sabha constituencies, he directly attacked Kamal Nath for “rise in corruption, worsening law and order and the transfer scam”. “Congress has done three things in 2-5 months of coming to power. The party let law and order worsen, encouraging kidnappers and murderers. It ran a transfer industry, harassed employees and openly auctioned posts. And it siphoned money from welfare schemes. If this is the trailer, imagine what Congress will do if given charge of the entire country,” he said. After three rounds of elections, those who were crying hoarse against his policies are no longer proactive, he said. The PM sought to position BJP as the clear frontrunner, saying, “Almost half of the nation has cast its mandate in the first three phases of polling. A clear wave favouring development seems to have emerged from the public, which has suppressed the opposition plan. They have now turned silent to protect their existence. This silence means a lot — Phir Ek Baar, Modi Sarkar.” Earlier in the day, at Sidhi Lok Sabha constituency, where he accused the Kamal Nath government of not disbursing money given by the Centre for farmers’ pension, the PM said, “The chief minister is too busy to spare time for the poor and farmers, and to provide them the benefits announced by BJP government.” Modi said the CM has no time to share with the Centre the list of farmers eligible for assistance under PM Kisan, which provides an assistance of Rs 6,000 a year. “In fact, the CMs of both Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are busy in the political grooming of their sons who are contesting elections this time. They have no time for the common people. In such a case, will the public select them?” he asked. Taking potshots at opposition alliances, he said leaders were aspiring to be the next PM. “They have already ordered new clothes from their tailors. But the people must decide if there is anyone in the opposition wanting to become PM who can wipe out terrorism,” he said. Modi called upon first-time voters to keep the “requirements of 21st century and their future in mind” when they vote. He asked BJP to ensure 100% voting in their areas “so that first-time voters can decide their fate for the coming five years” In Video:PM Narendra Modi slams Congress, defends demonetisationDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."
Residents queue up at ATM to recreate DeMon nightmare | Ajmer News - Times of India,"AJMER: The residents of Ward 38 of Dholabhata region here, came out in large numbers at an ATM in the locality on Tuesday, to recreate the suffering of demonetisation. The protesters shouted slogans demanding to know the outcome of demonetisation and said that they had come out to show that their votes are important and that they wanted to question the government. Dholabhata region is largely a backward area, where majority of residents are daily wagers and work as labourers. “The residents approached me and discussed as to who they should vote for and I suggested that they should discuss every issue and decide themselves,” said Lalit Verma, corporator of ward 38 of Ajmer Municipal Corporation. The residents held banners that read messages seeking reasons for demonetisation and formed a long queue at an ATM in the locality. “Basically, the backward class suffered a lot at the time of demonetisation and I witnessed that as their representative,” added Verma. Ramesh Saini, one of the residents, said that in days that followed demonetisation, their community had to stand in long queues at the ATMs to get their own money. “People of this area are very simple and hard working, but they suffered because they are economically backward,” said Ramesh. He further said the protest was the decision of the people of the locality and their corporator Lalit Verma backed them. Verma said that people should ask questions and also use their right to protest in a constitutional manner. Sunita Koli, another resident, said that after seeing the protesters lining up at the ATM, she recalled her ordeal and how she suffered back then, to just withdraw a Rs two thousand note. The protest went on for an hour, wherein the protesters lined up at the ATM shouted slogans that they wanted an answer from the Modi government about the success of demonetisation.

Naveen targets NDA govt over GST and demonetisation | Bhubaneswar News - Times of India,"BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday targeted the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre for allegedly working for the interests of the rich. He criticized the Narendra Modi government on demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), though he had extended support to the Centre on both these issues. “The BJP is a party of rich people. It has been working for them. It has focused on the interests of the rich by moves like GST and demonetisation. The poor have got poorer while demonetisation snatched the jobs of youths. This is the reason why BJP is losing everywhere,” Naveen said at political rallies in Salipur and Mahanga constituencies under the Kendrapada parliamentary segment, on the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi also visited the Lok Sabha seat. The chief minister’s tirade against the Centre came hours after Modi criticized him over political violence in the state and said people had made up their mind to opt for BJP governments at the state and the Centre. The BJD has pitted cine star and Rajya Sabha member Anubhav Mohanty in Kendrapada against Baijayant Panda, who resigned from the party last year and joined BJP recently. The Congress has fielded lawyer-politician Dharanidhar Nayak in the Kendrapada Lok Sabha seat. Earlier, while addressing a meeting in the Bhadrak parliamentary constituency, Naveen targeted BJP over the vaunted Gujarat model of development. “Despite huge publicity about the Gujarat model, BJP managed to barely scrape through the 2017 assembly elections. The government at the Centre has lost the faith of the common man. Farmers, youth, women, the poor and the SCs/STs are fed up with it,” he said. Taking a dig at Modi’s double-engine theory (referring to BJP governments both at the Centre and the state), Naveen asked why had people rejected the same in the Hindi heartland. “Why have people rejected the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Punjab? It will face a defeat in the entire country this time,” he said. Banking heavily on Kalia — a direct cash assistance scheme for farmers — Naveen reiterated that the Centre was plotting to derail the scheme. “Over 40 lakh families have benefited under Kalia.

"BJP, Congress did little to end poverty: Mayawati - Times of India","FARRUKHABAD (UP): BSP supremo Mayawati Tuesday said the BJP and Congress governments did little to address issues of poverty and unemployment. ""Poverty and unemployment increased ever since the BJP came to power at the Centre. The Congress, too, has not kept its promises,"" Mayawati said while addressing an election meeting in support of SP-BSP candidate Manoj Agarwal in Farrukhabad. The BSP supremo further said the GST and demonetisation were initiated by the BJP government without any preparation, leading to poverty and unemployment. ""It also had an adverse impact on the country's economy,"" she said, adding that the BJP government misused the CBI and the ED to its advantage. Reminding people about corruption during the BJP and Congress regimes, Mayawati said the Bofors case took place during the Congress rule while the Rafale scam surfaced when the BJP was in power. She asked if the poverty of farmers could be removed with just Rs 6,000 being provided by the union government annually under a scheme. Attacking the Congress, she said it had been in power since Independence but did little to benefit people.

PM's remarks on nukes 'highly irresponsible': Amarinder Singh - Times of India,"JALANDHAR: Taking a strong dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his remark that nuclear weapons were not meant for Diwali, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh has said that it is a highly irresponsible statement.  “Unfortunate thing for a responsible leader of any nation to say that nuclear arsenal we have kept is not meant for Diwali which means it could be used. That I think is highly irresponsible for Modi to say it,” said Punjab chief minister here on Monday.  As Congress in Punjab started filing of nomination of its candidates from Jalandhar, Amarinder accompanied Jalandhar candidate Chaudhary Santokh Singh and later he addressed the rally in which he strongly took on the Modi government and said that BJP-led government at the Centre had plunged into a state of ruin and devastation.  “This is a jung (war) for the future of the nation. We are fighting a party that made tall promises but failed to deliver on even a single one of them,” the chief minister later said, addressing a public meeting held outside district administration complex.  He questioned that why Modi and Badals were not making demonetisation and GST their poll issues even as they had claimed that these were big achievements of the Modi government. ""Now they don't even mention demonetisation,” he quipped.  Flaying the prime minister for blatant politicization of the armed forces, Amarinder said that the Army and the forces were not Modi’s personal property and any government of the day would have done what he did in the wake of the Pulwama attack. ""Every day, army and paramilitary personnel are dying in the line of duty, and yet the prime minister has the audacity to take credit for their actions,” he added.  Pointing out that unemployment rate was at an all-time high, Captain Amarinder ridiculed PM Modi’s promise of `achche din’, saying “acche din us din aange jis din enna da bhog payega” (good days will come only when their rule is brought to an end).

EC special observers abusing people of West Bengal: Mamata Banerjee - Times of India,"GAYESHPUR/RANAGHAT: Claiming that officers sent by the Election Commission as special observers are abusing and insulting the people of West Bengal, Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee on Sunday accused the BJP of trying to run a parallel government in the state. The chief minister also alleged that the poll panel has deputed the two retired officers to run the government in Bengal. ""The officers are abusing and insulting the people of the state,"" she said, reacting to special observer Ajay V Nayak's observation that the situation in Bengal is similar to what it was in Bihar around 10 to 15 years ago. The people have lost faith in the state police, and therefore, their demand for deployment of central forces at all polling booths has increased, Nayak, a former chief electoral officer of Bihar, said on Saturday. ""The BJP is trying to run a parallel government in the state,"" she said, adding, ""Two retired officers have been sent to run the government, this is unconstitutional. They are trying to help the BJP."" Banerjee said that in 2016, assembly elections were held with deployment of central forces in all the booths, but that did not deter her party from registering a resounding victory. Alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Mann ki Baat' addresses were full of falsehood, the CM said that he spoke the language of the RSS on radio over the last five years. ""The prime minister's position has a stature, I have never seen a person stoop so low,"" she said, addressing two election rallies in Nadia district. Claiming that lakhs of migrant labourers lost their jobs due to demonetisation, she said, ""You had done notebandi, people will do votebandi."" She alleged that labourers from Bengal were killed and subjected to violence in the then BJP-ruled Rajasthan and other places, leading to their mass return out of fear of persecution. Banerjee accused the Modi government of depriving West Bengal in the last five years. ""Every day, he is resorting to lies. They are seasonal birds, who come during elections only and vanish after the polls,"" she said. Asserting that she faced several vilification bids throughout her political career, the CM said, ""I don't care if someone calls me a thief"". Banerjee added that she has written 87 books and a number of songs, royalties from which are enough for her sustenance. Neither the BJP nor the Congress will win the general elections. Instead, friendly regional parties will form the government at the Centre, she said. ""The BJP, the Congress and the CPI(M), who are all brothers in arms, will become mere signboards... after the elections,"" Banerjee said.

BJP leaders benefited from demonetization: Ashok Gehlot - Times of India,"JAISALMER: In a major statement, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that BJP leaders benefited out of demonetization and were using large number of helicopters and pricey aircrafts in the parliamentary elections. He was addressing a public meeting in Pokhran town of Jaisalmer in support of his son and Jodhpur Lok Sabha candidate Vaibhav Gehlot on Saturday. Gehlot alleged that suitcases of black money of BJP leaders were changed into white illegally by the banks during demonetisation. At the time of demonetisation, people’s financial condition turned worse and over 300 people died. He did not spare even people with small savings. Due to the decision, the economic condition of the country worsened. In his 35-minute speech, the CM mentioned the Modi government thrice and said that the present government was elected to power with majority on issues like eradicating terrorism and naxalism, but no efforts to curb them were made at the ground level. Terrorism is spreading and the entire country is not feeling safe due to naxalism. Even today, there is unemployment in the country and farmers are committing suicide. It clearly shows that Modi government was digressing from the main issues and playing politics on religion, army’s bravery and surgical strike. Modi also does not remember the sacrifice made by Indira Gandhi as she laid her life for the country’s integrity and did not allow formation of Khalistan. He said that the present government had combined the rail and Union budgets which went against the tradition of two separate budgets during Congress regime. Maximum ministers at the Centre were without experience and were taking wrong decisions due to which people of the country were facing problems, Gehlot said. He assured that once Congress came to power at the Centre, it will make a separate budget for farmers. Attacking the previous Vasundhara Raje government, he said it had neglected the entire Marwar region including Jodhpur. People of Rajasthan bid farewell to the Raje government in the state and now it is the turn of the Modi government at the Centre. Appealing people to vote for Vaibhav, he said that he will do development works in the entire area like he used to. Gehlot added that BJP candidate from Jodhpur Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Union minister of state for agriculture, did not do any solid work for farmers, nor made any schemes. Meanwhile, the election campaigning scenario heated up in Jodhpur after chief minister Ashok Gehlot had a whirlwind trail in the constituency addressing public meetings at six assembly constituencies of Jodhpur on Saturday. He returned to his home turf ten days after gathering a huge galaxy of party leaders and ministers for the nomination filing ceremony of his son and party candidate from Jodhpur seat Vaibhav Gehlot. Beginning from Pokhran assembly constituency, Gehlot addressed meetings at Sekhala in Shergarh and Lunawas in Luni after which he entered the city and addressed three more meetings at Soorsagar, Sardarpura and Jodhpur city before calling it a day. While addressing the people, Gehlot said that Vasundhara Raje government had to go on account of her wrong policies and anti-people decisions and now on the same lines, Modi government was also set to go. Seeking votes for his son Vaibhav, he urged the people to make him victorious with good margin. “Vaibhav has been roped in from Jodhpur on the demand of the people. Now, it is you who have to bless him with your votes and send him to the parliament in the form of your son, brother or nephew. I assure you that there would be no dearth of development here,” said Gehlot. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."
"Nyay will act like petrol, kickstart engine of economy: Rahul Gandhi - Times of India","BILASPUR: Congress president Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday that the `Nyay' minimum income scheme promised by his party will act like ""petrol"" and revive the economy. He was addressing his first poll rally in Chhattisgarh after the Lok Sabha elections were announced. With the Nyay scheme, people will be able to buy things they need ""which will revive manufacturing units and thereby generate employment opportunities"", he said. ""Nyay scheme will act like petrol for the Indian economy which will kickstart its engine,"" he added. ""In 2014, Narendra Modi made tall promises of providing two crore jobs, fair prices to farmers and depositing Rs 15 lakh in everyone's bank account,"" the Congress chief said. Instead, Modi ""snatched money from the poor and put it in the pockets"" of a few businessmen, he said. ""Modi had raised hopes of people by promising to deposit Rs 15 lakh in their account. I was well aware that it cannot be done,"" Gandhi said. ""I spoke with world's renowned economists and senior leaders of Congress about how much money can be put into the accounts of the poor so that it would not affect the economy. I spoke to (former finance minister) P C Chidambaram and others and asked them to come up with a figure. ""Chidambaram came to me and said we can give Rs 72,000 to five crore poor families per year,"" he said. ""When we promised to waive farm loans in Chhattisgarh, Modi had asked where the money will come from. But we showed where the money comes from after waiving farm loans in Chhattigsrh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan (after winning Assembly polls in the three states),"" Gandhi said. ""As soon as we are elected to power, we will deposit Rs 72,000 in bank accounts of poorest families,"" he said. ""In the 21st century, India will surely eliminate poverty. We will show it by carrying out a surgical strike on poverty in the next 10-15 years,"" the Congress chief said. The money under Nyay will be deposited in the account of the woman member of the family because it was women ""who have suffered much due to demonetisation"", he said. The unemployment rate in the country stands at a 45-year high due to demonetisation and the ""Gabbar Singh Tax"" (as he refers to Goods and Services Tax), Gandhi said. During demonetisation, ""money was taken out from people's pockets and put in banks"" and later given to businessmen like Nirav Modi who fled from the country, Gandhi said. Promising a separate farmers' budget, Gandhi said wherever farmers seek loan waiver, the demand will be met. The Congress has fielded Atal Shrivastav, state Congress' general secretary, from Bilaspur, which will go to the polls in the third phase on April 23. His main rival is BJP's Arun Sao.

PM should apologise to the nation for note ban failure: N Chandrababu Naidu | Vijayawada News - Times of India,"VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to apologise for demonetization and for introducing Rs 2,000 note. Naidu said demonetization was a total failure. He said the central government had failed to handle the issue and had put people to severe hardship. “Demonetization was not planned and it caused severe inconvenience to people and the country’s economy was badly hit. The PM should apologise to the nation for his failure,” Naidu said. “The country is bleeding from the failures of the BJP-led government,” the chief minister said. He said he was fighting against the failures and misrule of the BJP government to give a better future for people. Naidu also made an appeal to people, particularly to the intellectuals and the youth to raise their voice against the undemocratic rule of Modi. He said it was time for the nation to raise its voice against Modi. “Modi is using democratic institutions against his rivals and such political witch-hunt is not healthy for the nation and democracy.” Chandrababu Naidu will be joining Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy and Congress president Rahul Gandhi at an election campaign meeting at Raichur in Karnataka on Friday.

"Even in hung Parliament, we will thwart all BJP efforts to form government: Stalin - Times of India","After taking over the reins from his late father M Karunanidhi, MK Stalin is leading DMK for the first time in Lok Sabha polls. He talks to B Sivakumar about the Modi government, backing Rahul Gandhi and missing his father’s guidance As the campaign comes to a close, how do you rate the prospects of your front?There is visible anger against the Modi and AIADMK governments. People are prepared to vote for the Secular Progressive Front led by DMK. We will win all 40 seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. In case of a hung Parliament, will DMK support BJP with or without Modi at the helm?Regional parties will play a bigger role in this election. People across all states are keen on unseating Modi because they have suffered at the hands of the central government. If there is a hung Parliament, we will thwart all efforts of BJP to form the government. We will form a secular government. What would be DMK's stand if the 'Third Front' emerges as the deciding factor with SP, BSP, TRS and YSRC playing a major role?Our goal is to defeat the fascist BJP government and form a government headed by Congress president Rahul Gandhi. In case of a hung Parliament, we will take a call after consulting Congress, Left and other parties. As 22 assembly segments are facing bypolls, are you confident of toppling the state government?After Jayalalithaa's death, people have been asking us why we have not brought this government down. We want to do it only through a democratic process. Byelection to 22 seats gives us a chance to topple this government. We will fulfil people's wish in a democratic manner. If DMK gets enough numbers with the support of the allies, will you form the government or seek dissolution of the assembly?We will take a decision after consulting alliance partners. We will carry out people's wish. Wait and see. On what basis have you been claiming during the campaign that the present AIADMK government will fall?Edappadi's is a minority government. It remains in office only because of the Centre's support, violating all constitutional norms. These elections will bring about a change both at the Centre as well as in the state. In the campaign, do you miss your father?I really miss him. I have seen him more as a leader than as father. People and party cadres miss his magnetic, gruff voice, in which he used to address them as 'udanpirappe' (my brothers and sisters) for the past 60 years. We follow his teachings and the path shown by him. I learned everything about politics from him. I follow his footsteps. Had he been alive today, he would have guided us. DMK has promised several loan waivers in the manifesto. If Congress forms the government at the Centre, given the precarious financial condition, do you think they can be implemented?It is definitely possible. When DMK formed the government in 2006, the previous AIADMK government had left the treasury empty. But after swearing in, the first thing that then-CM M Karunanidhi did was to waive Rs 7,000 crore in agriculture loans. There were criticisms that it would burden the state's finance. But by attracting investors to the state, pushing industrial growth and securing help from the Centre, we lowered the deficit. In the last five years, the Centre's policies helped only very few companies owned by Adani, Ambani and Amit Shah's son. People were affected by demonetisation and other wrong policies of the Centre. We will have better policies to solve the financial problems. We will implement all promises made in the manifesto. How do you rate TTV Dhinakaran and his party AMMK?In a democracy, new parties emerge and some disappear. What is being seen now is a fight among partners. It is a fight between those who have power and those who lost it. On May 23, we will know how people view it. Your son Udayanidhi has been a star campaigner in this election? Will he be given any formal post in the party?I thank the media for showering him with love. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."
Business down 50% in drought-hit Marathwada village market | Mumbai News - Times of India,"OSMANABAD: Rows of mangalsutras, anklets and earrings hang forlornly in Razzak Shaikh’s make-shift stall in Walvad village market in Osmanabad district’s arid Bhoom taluka. A few villagers linger to fleetingly touch the costume jewellery but then move on. The searing drought in Marathwada region has resulted in villagers postponing marriages, directly impacting Razzaq’s trade. “I used to do business worth Rs 2,000 per market day. Now, I make barely Rs 500 as there are hardly any marriages,” says Shaikh. Most stall-owners at the market agree that trade is down by at least 50%-60%. The reason is not just the drought. Business at this rural market never fully recovered after demonetisation two-and-a-half years ago, says Shaikh. “After note-bandi, the mazdoors (labourers) who came to the market had no money. I barely sold anything for nearly nine months. Last year, I took a loan of Rs 1 lakh for the first time since I started this trade a decade ago,” he adds. Mallikarjun Bhobe, who sells saris and shirt material, faces the same crisis. He used to make at least Rs 5,000 on each market day. Now, it’s down to Rs 1,000-Rs 1,500. “After note-bandi, all of us started making losses. But there are no other jobs for us here so I have no choice but to continue this trade,” says Bhobe. The market is located in Osmanabad district which goes to the polls on Thursday. In this constituency, NCP’s Ranajagjitsinh Patil and Shiv Sena’s Omraje Nimbalkar are facing each other in what is being viewed as a tough battle. The sitting MP is Shiv Sena’s Ravindra Gaikwad, but this is one constituency in the region which faces a strong opponent and a possible change of guard. Despite the extreme rural distress in the region, strong caste polarisation has been the dominant factor in Marathwada’s contests. Even bigger traders at the market, like Naseem Baig who sells masalas, have taken a hit. Baig estimates that he made a loss of Rs 1 lakh after demonetisation. GST has also played a role, he adds. “I even tried to get my daughter-in-law, a BEd degree-holder, a job to improve family income, but in vain,” says Baig.

"India’s steel sector to see faster growth in 2019, says worldsteel - Times of India","VISAKHAPATNAM: Having overcome the shocks of demonetisation and the Goods & Services Tax (GST) implementation, the Indian economy is now expected to achieve faster growth starting in the second half of 2019 after the election. While the fiscal deficit might weigh on public investment to an extent, the wide range of continuing infrastructure projects is likely to support growth in steel demand above 7% in both 2019 and 2020, according to the World Steel Association’s (worldsteel) Short Range Outlook (SRO), released on Tuesday. In the SRO emailed to TOI from Brussels, Belgium -- where worldsteel is headquartered, it forecast that the global steel demand will reach 1,735 million tonnes (mt) in 2019, an increase of 1.3% over 2018. In 2020, demand is projected to grow by 1% to reach 1,752 mt. Commenting on the outlook, Al Remeithi, chairman of the worldsteel economics committee said, “In 2019 and 2020, global steel demand is expected to continue to grow, but growth rates will moderate in tandem with a slowing global economy. Uncertainty over the trade environment and volatility in the financial markets have not yet subsided and could pose downside risks to this forecast.” livebudget updatesmoreupdatesAccording to the SRO, in 2018, global steel demand increased by 2.1% (after adjusting for China induction furnace closures), growing slightly slower than in 2017. In 2019 and 2020 growth is still expected, but in a less favourable economic environment. China’s deceleration, a slowing global economy, and uncertainty surrounding trade policies and the political situation in many regions suggest a possible moderation in business confidence and investment. “Chinese steel demand continues to decelerate as the combined effect of economic rebalancing and trade tension is leading to slowing investment and sluggish manufacturing performance. Mild government stimulus cushioned the economic slowdown in 2018. In 2019, the government is likely to heighten the level of stimulus, which is expected to boost steel demand,” it said. Steel demand in the developed economies grew by 1.8% in 2018 following a resilient 3.1% growth in 2017. “We expect demand to further decelerate to 0.3% in 2019 and 0.7% in 2020, reflecting a deteriorating trade environment,” the SRO of worldsteel said. “As pent-up demand and government stimulus measures subsided, the automotive industry saw a sharp slowdown in growth in 2018 in many countries, in particular in the EU, Turkey and China. As a result, global auto production growth decelerated to 2.2% in 2018 from 4.9% in 2017. In 2019, global auto production will continue to decelerate to 1% growth with stabilisation expected in 2020,” it said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."

No corruption in putting money in own dormant bank a/c: Gujarat HC | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has quashed cheating and corruption charges levelled by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against a gold trader after he deposited huge amount in his own dormant bank accounts post-demonetization. While trashing an FIR, Justice A P Thaker made it clear, “By mere deposit of huge amount in his dormant account cannot be termed as cheating or any offence under the Indian Penal Code or under the Prevention of Corruption Act.” In this case, Viral Shah deposited total Rs 4.2 crore in his two dormant accounts after the central government demonetized high-value currency notes in November 2016. The limits given to banks by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to accept amount up to Rs 50,000 without seeking any explanation from the depositors. Since, Shah deposited a huge amount in his accounts in UCO bank, he was booked for cheating and corruption along with the then bank manager by the CBI. The probe agency charged Shah because he deposited a big amount in his accounts which were last operated in 2013. The bank manager transferred the amount through RTGS after Shah deposited the amount in old notes in his accounts. Shah approached the high court through advocate Chetan Pandya, who argued that there was no case of cheating made out, if a person deposits money in his own bank account. The lawyer submitted that Shah sold gold and accepted money in old demonetized currency and deposited the notes in bank in the 50-day period the government granted people for exchange. There was no question of cheating and corruption. The high court accepted that there was no case of cheating or corruption. It said that by depositing the huge amount in his bank accounts, Shah exposed himself and if the government finds that he had not paid due taxes, the government can recover taxes and impose penalty. But this is definitely not a case of cheating and corruption. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

 Congress cites 'sting' to allege post-DeMo currency exchange for commission; BJP refutes charges | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday cited a 'sting operation' to allege exchange of old notes post-demonetisation for hefty commissions by people claiming proximity to the government and the BJP, but the ruling party refuted the allegations and said it would take appropriate legal action. At a press conference here, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal also alleged that currency notes worth thousands of crores were printed abroad and then transported into the country through Indian Air force planes after December 31, 2016. He alleged that ""a team of government officials drawn from different departments were engaged in the exchange of old notes for new post-demonetisation"". He, however, did not authenticate the videos he showed at the conference and said these are in the public domain and the concerned agencies should initiate a probe. Sibal also claimed the Election Commission was not acting on their complaints. Responding to the charges, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in Patna ""Kapil Sibal has made false allegations on our (party) president (Amit Shah) and we will take legal action."" A defence ministry spokesperson said, ""It is categorically refuted that any Indian Air Force aircraft was tasked to fly abroad for carrying currency prior to, during or after demonetisation as alleged in a video released today."" ""Demonetisation is the biggest scam in the history of India. Current notes (issued after the old Rs 500/100 notes were demonetised in November 2016) were printed abroad and transported into India and there can be nothing more anti-national than this,"" Sibal told reporters. ""Mr Modi started his tenure by fooling us and he is ending his five-year-tenure by traumatising us. He traumatised the people of this country, he has traumatised the poor of this country, he has traumatised journalists and his political opponents. He has used the agencies to target people who are opposed to him,"" he said. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said Sibal has exposed the ""stench of corruption that has reached the highest echelons of the Modi government"". ""If this is not 'anti-national', then what is? Will the Supreme Court show the courage to take note and hold the corrupt accountable?"" he asked. Referring to the Income Tax Department's action against Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath's aides, the Congress leader said the alacrity with which the Enforcement Directorate and the I-T have acted, they should also act fast and arrest the people in the video and tell the country what has happened. Asked if he or his party would seek any judicial intervention by moving the court on this issue, the former minister said there is no time left for elections and therefore the matter cannot be taken up. He said the government should initiate a probe into allegations made in the video and immediately register an FIR in the matter. Sibal also asked the EC to take immediate action in the matter. He accused the government agencies of acting against BJP's political rivals, but not against those who are close to the ruling party or the government despite complaints against them.

"BJP leaders 'selective' in respecting martyrs, not patriots: Priyanka Gandhi - Times of India","FATEHPUR: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the BJP on Saturday for turning patriotism into an election issue and ignoring the poor and farmers, saying had the ruling party leaders been patriots they would not have been ""selective"" in respecting martyrs. Addressing a 'nukkad sabha' in favour of Congress nominee Rakesh Sachan in Fatehpur, the Congress general secretary in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh said, ""The issue of patriotism is raised whenever elections come, but the real questions on farmers, unemployed, women safety are left behind."" On a day-long visit to the constituency, during which she held a roadshow clad in a red cotton saree, Priyanka cited the examples of demonetisation and BJP's promise to bring back black money to say that ""big announcements (by this government) are often linked to patriotism."" The government has said high-value banknotes were demonetised suddenly in November 2016 in ""national interest"" and to curb black money circulation. ""During demonetisation, people were asked to stand in queues stating it was patriotism as this will bring back black money. Was it brought back? Not a single paisa came back. But people were harassed,"" Priyanka said. ""Is there anyone who is not a patriot?"" ""All are patriots. The biggest patriotism is having faith in democracy and using right to vote judiciously as a weapon. Remaining aware and vigilant is biggest patriotism,"" she stressed. The Congress leader, who arrived to a rousing reception at the Kanpur airport earlier in the day and reached here by road, said, ""You all know how leaders like us are... Make them stand on the dias and they will forget that it was you who gave them power. You will have to remain vigilant."" Attacking the ruling party, she said, ""BJP leaders make tall claims. Had they been such big patriots they would have respected the martyrs - whether Hindus or Muslims or father of the Opposition party leader. You cannot be selective in this. So, respect Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi. If you are really patriots."" Alleging that farmers have got a raw deal in the BJP government, she said thousands had marched to Delhi for loan waiver but were ""sent back"". ""Where was your (BJP's) patriotism. You slammed the doors when farmers needed you,"" she said. On the problem of unemployment, she said she has been meeting the jobless all over the country, and asked why the promises made to citizens of the country remain unfulfilled. The Congress general secretary, who recently campaigned in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency Varanasi, said when she enquired about the development there - as tall claims had been made about it - she was shown a 15-km road from the airport. She was told, she said, the stretch was part of a 150-km road project announced during the rule of the previous UPA government. Attacking Modi, she said he could not reach out to even a single poor family in his parliamentary constituency in the past five years. ""This is his 'deshbhakti'? That he can go to Africa, America, China, Japan, Pakistan. Can have biryani and return but cannot seek the well-being of any poor in his own constituency. ""He made a tall claim in 2014 that Rs 15 lakh will be deposited in the bank accounts. Who has got that money?"" she asked. Stressing that the Congress party keeps its promises, she said Congress president Rahul Gandhi contacted former finance ministers to enquire how much can be given to the poor without harming the economy and this led to the concept of Nyay scheme, under which it has promised to give Rs 72,000 to 20 per cent poor families in the country. There is a difference between Congress's Nyay scheme and Rs 15-lakh promise of the the BJP, she said. ""... Soon after the 2013 election, their state unit president said it was only an election jumla while Congress's promise on loan waiver in the assembly election in three states (MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan) has started taking shape,"" she said. The Congress general secretary also said that farmers were not getting the right remuneration for their produce and made to guard their fields in the night to protect their crops from stray cattle. ""When Congress announces separate budget for farmers, they say there is no budget for it but waives thousands of crores of industrialists who do not need that money. This is their reality,"" she alleged. ""This country is based on non-violence and this is the first country based on truth. No amount of propaganda can hide truth...even if they say that nothing was done in 60 years,"" she said. Stressing that people have a lot of wisdom, she said it was because they had thought that Congress had ""lost its way"" they voted it out of power. ""But now your hopes have been crushed by BJP. You need to vote judiciously in the coming election which will decide the future of not just the people but also of the country,"" she said. She said her brother and Congress president Rahul Gandhi wants to evolve a new kind of politics and so has sent her to strengthen the party organisation. ""You understand who has the right intention and who does not. Those who want to harm institutions want to harm you to keep you backward for the sake of their interest,"" she added.

Panchkula: Torn demonetised currency found in bags from garbage dump | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"PANCHKULA: The district police have found damaged demonitised currency stacked in bags from a garbage dump near Amravati Enclave in Pinjore. Panchkula deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Kamaldeep Goyal said that the bags have been taken into possession and the case was being investigated. According to the police, a person noticed bags full of torn and mutilated old currency thrown at a garbage dump. DCP Kamaldeep Goyal said on receiving information, he rushed to the spot and found 10 to 15 bags. DCP Goyal said it was not possible to assess the amount of old currency, looking at the number of bags, one can presume that currency to the value of crore of rupees was destroyed. ""We are investigating the case as the currency notes are not in their original form. But still it needs to be ascertained that who disposed the old currency. Not all notes found mutilated were demonetized,"" the DCP said. Panchkula police in December 2017 seized a car and arrested four persons for transporting demonetised currency worth Rs 80 lakh. Similarly, Mohali police in February 2018 arrested three persons with demonitised currency worth Rs 1.5 crore. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

No surge in number of I-T stop-filers after demonetisation: CBDT - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT) said on Thursday that the tax base and revenues had increased significantly post demonetisation and there was no surge in the people who stopped filing returns. “CBDT clarified that contrary to the report, it is a fact that demonetization had a phenomenal positive impact on the widening of tax base and direct tax collections,” the tax department said while responding to a news report. It said 6.87 crore Income Tax Returns (ITRs) were filed during FY 2017-18 as compared to 5.48 crore ITRs filed during FY 2016-17, translating into a growth of 25%. A statement from the department said during FY 2017-18, the number of new ITR filers has also increased to 1.07 crore as compared to 86.16 lakh new filers added during FY 2016-17. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesThe net direct tax collections for 2017-18 amounted to Rs. 10.03 lakh crore, which is 18% higher than the collections for 2016-17. The growth rate of 18% for 2017-18 is the highest in last seven financial years. A substantial part of this growth is attributed to the impact of demonetization, the statement said. “CBDT also wishes to make it very clear that the information about “Stop Filers” is incorrect and the data source quoted is not from the Income Tax Department. CBDT does not have any word “Stop Filers” in its glossary and it does not maintain any MIS or database of “Stop Filers” in normal course, the statement said.  “As such there is no term or keyword as “Stop Filers” in our parlance and we maintain data of only “Dropped Filers”, which is defined as a person who was earlier in the filer base but has not filed return in any of the last three financial year. On the other hand, a “New Filer” is a person who has filed return in the current financial year and not filed return in the previous three Financial Years,” it said. The tax department also said that it is clear from the data New Filers have increased significantly while the Dropped Fliers have reduced consistently over a period of time and the positive impact of demonetization is phenomenally evident. It said that data showed that the number of Dropped Filers has actually declined in FY 2017-18 to 25.22 lakh from 28.34 lakh in FY 2016-17.

"Hit by GST, demonetisation, dollar city wants sheen back - Times of India","If a worker becoming the owner of a business enterprise is an inspiring but rare success story, it is a common phenomenon in Tirupur. The multi-billion dollar garment industry in Tirupur was built over the past four decades by the sheer hard work and ingenuity of the people here. But the slogan ‘Netraya thozhilali, indraya muthalali’ (worker yesterday, owner today) seems to have lost traction in the dollar city. “People running their own tailoring and other allied units have shut shop and have become supervisors in bigger units,” says K S Babuji, general secretary, Collar Shirts and Inner Wear Small Scale Manufacturers Association. It was not long back when the garment units went as far as the north-east states to hold recruitment drives. The drives have stopped now as the total exports from the garment sector had plummeted to Rs 24,000 crore in 2017-18 from Rs 26,000 crore the previous year. The youngest constituency – carved with portions from Coimbatore and Gobichettipalayam – in 2009 is bruised. “Clearly GST, demonetisation and absence of policy initiatives have landed us in this situation,” said an industrialist. The plummeting fortunes has spilled over to the dusty roads and congested lanes of Tirupur where people have started feeling the pinch of downturn. The list of demands of the industrial sector is long and the primary ones being a free trade agreement with Europe and relaxation of GST norms. Former forest minister and AIADMK candidate M S M Ananthan and CPI’s three-time MP K Subbarayan who are locking horns make it a point in every meeting to promise revival of the sector. The growth of industrial sector would no doubt help the whole region grow, but the common man has other demands too. The roads are bad to say the least. Right from the early 80s when the budding garment industry started earning forex, infrastructure growth was grossly disproportionate to the growth of the city. If the growth story of Tirupur is inspiring, the metamorphosis of a sleepy agrarian region into a thriving industrial hub came with its own cost. The Orathupalayam dam stands as a sad reminder to it. It’s one dam that the farmers do not want to be opened. The dam, which was built in 1992, was shut within years as effluents let into the Noyyal River drained into the dam making it a cesspool of chemicals. The AIADMK government, in 2004, helped build effluent treatment plants, which kept both the industrial segment and farmers happy. The win-win arrangement helped the AIADMK win consequently in 2009 and 2014. This time too, the AIADMK hopes to repeat the same with announcement of Avinashi Athikadavu water scheme. But for Tirupur North and South assembly segments , four other assembly constituencies – Bhavani, Gobichettipalayam, Perundurai and Anthiyur – are largely agrarian. Though the scheme directly benefits only Perundurai and Tirupur north, AIADMK hopes to win the hearts and votes of the huge farming community in the remaining four segments too.

"Intel: Rs 10,000 crore cash arriving in Tamil Nadu - Times of India","CHENNAI: The seizure of Rs 11.5 crore in cash at a cement godown in Vellore district by the IT investigation wing on Monday appears to have confirmed the Election Commission's worst fears about the influence of money in the Lok Sabha polls in Tamil Nadu. Intelligence agencies have estimated that more than Rs 10,000 crore could be pumped in by various political parties into campaigning and for bribing voters in TN and Puducherry by April 18, the polling day. The poll panel has already designated all 40 LS seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, along with 70 other seats across the country, as ""expenditure sensitive"". So far, Rs 78.12 crore in cash has been seized in the state. During Monday's predawn raid, I-T sleuths found new currency bundles dumped in gunny bags and cardboard boxes at the godown in Vellore in northern Tamil Nadu. The godown is owned by a DMK functionary. Many bundles were in Rs 200 denomination. Some were neatly packed in envelopes with details of municipal and village wards written on them. I-T officials said they were meant to be distributed among voters. A senior RBI official said the present seizure, unlike the earlier ones - especially the seizure of Rs 24 crore in Rs 2,000 denomination - in Chennai and Vellore after demonetisation in 2016, can be tracked to the bank that disbursed the cash. DMK treasurer S Duraimurugan's son Kathir Anand is the party candidate in Vellore LS constituency. I-T officials have been searching the premises of Duraimurugan and Kadhir since Friday. During the search at their house in Katpadi, officials seized Rs 10.5 lakh with ward details and amounts written on them.

Kotak Mahindra Bank first lender to charge for UPI use - Times of India,"BENGALURU: Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which has been leading the digital payments push since demonetisation, will no longer be free to use for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions as Kotak Mahindra Bank has become the first lender to charge beyond a monthly limit of 30 transactions from May. Several other banks have held discussions with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the umbrella payments body that manages UPI, to bring fees and cap the number of free monthly P2P transactions from one bank account, said sources. Kotak Mahindra, in an email notification to some of its account holders, said it will charge Rs 2.50 for every transaction worth Rs 1,000 or less while the same would be Rs 5 for transactions of more than Rs 1,000. This will be applicable across all platforms, including Paytm, PhonePe and Google Pay, three players who now control 90% of the transactions. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesA Kotak Mahindra Bank spokesperson defended the move, saying that 95% of its customers do an average of 5-10 UPI transactions per month. A PhonePe spokesperson said the company will not charge users for P2P transactions while Paytm and Google Pay did not immediately offer a comment. For UPI, which clocked 674 million transactions worth over Rs 1 lakh crore in February, at least 80% of the transactions are P2P as P2M (peer-to-merchants) remains a smaller use-case. Incidentally, many kirana shops or unorganised businesses take payments via UPI from consumers, which are P2P in nature even though the money is going to a shop owner or a small business. While bigger consumer-focused banks like SBI or HDFC Bank are yet to levy such fees, executives of new-age payments firms said charging P2P transactions goes against the idea of UPI and would have a negative impact on the digital payments ecosystem, driving consumers to opt for cash payments.“If SBI starts charging for UPI, it will have a much bigger impact. Also, it’s clear banks don’t see much value for them in UPI and their own UPI apps haven’t been a great success. The cost model is such that the remitter bank pays for every P2P transaction. The remitter bank will have to pay money to NPCI, the payments service provider and the bank receiving the money. So it’s a revenue loss for these banks” said a senior executive of a Delhi-based payments player. Part of these measures is also being seen as curbing misuse of platforms. This comes after NPCI itself imposed a restriction of 10 transactions per-day for P2P transactions from the same account in October last year to curb misuse of the platform by deal-seekers to gain cashbacks and other incentives.

"FIU: 1,400% rise in reporting of shady dealings after demonetisation - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The 2016 demonetisation of two high-value currencies has led to an all-time high generation of over 14 lakh suspicious transaction reports (STRs), a record 1,400% jump over the past, by banks and other financial institutions in the country, a latest Financial Intelligence Unit report has found. This is the highest-ever figure of STRs since the FIU first started the regime over a decade ago.

Lok Sabha elections: Will jobs actually be top of mind when India casts its vote in this Lok Sabha elections? | - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Mar 30, 2019)What is the top issue dominating the minds of voters this critical election season? Multiple surveys have thrown up a unanimous answer— jobs, or more precisely, the lack of them. Surveys by Pew Research, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and Times Now have revealed unemployment as the top issue. The ADR survey, which queried 2.7 lakh people, said employment is the top priority for voters, and they ranked the incumbent government’s performance in this area at an abysmal 2.15 on a scale of 5 — a forgettable performance appraisal. Key opposition party Congress says it will make unemployment the rallying issue in its campaign. There are good reasons why the jobs crisis is getting so much attention. India is reeling under perhaps its worst ever job crisis. According to a leaked official report (denied by the government), India’s unemployment rate stood at a 45-year high at 6.1%, with youth being the most affected. In the world’s youngest and second most populous nation, unemployment is understandably an emotive issue. With a workforce of more than 450 million people, close to 10 million new workers enter the labour market annually. The jobs situation is a reflection of the economy. GDP growth has slowed down. Investment cycle hasn’t picked up. Amid sub-optimal capacity utilisation, fresh investment, especially in the private sector, has been of concern. Foreign direct investment, household savings and farm income have all shown worrying trends. Worse, some of the most labour-intensive sectors led by real estate are going through a rough patch. Post demonetisation and the GST roll-out, the MSME sector is facing multiple challenges. Manufacturing jobs fell in absolute terms from 58.9 million in 2011-12 to 48.3 million in 2015-16. Multiple sectors — from IT services, airlines to telecom — are going through a structural shift or consolidation. Understandably, this election, political parties are laying thrust on the job crisis, trying to put the Modi government on the mat. In the 2014 general elections, he promised to create two crore jobs annually if voted to power. The government has failed to deliver. Yet, when it comes to votes, jobs may not be the biggest rallying factor. Voting is a complex decision in India with caste, class, community, religion, political alliances and sops, etc. being important variables. Also, voters are aware that creating millions of jobs isn’t going to be easy for any party. Rising global trade barriers, automation and intensifying farm-to-non-farm transition make things difficult. A bigger problem is the demand-supply mismatch and India’s employability crisis where graduates are poorly skilled. Demographic dividend turning into a demographic curse has been a constant worry. So, will jobs be top of mind when the Indian voter steps into the voting booth this summer? ET Magazine reporters travelled to trade and industry hubs across the country to find out.

Men — young and old — rush to every car that stops by, hoping to land a job for the day. “It has become worse. Unemployment has risen. We have become poorer,” says Priyanshu Tiwari, 22, a jobless graduate who has been soliciting work here since 2017. He says the number of workers has multiplied — from around 200 then to now more than 500. Women, a rarity earlier, now have a visible presence. Tiwari, like many others here, barely manages to get hired for 10 days a month, at a daily wage Rs 400. “There are no jobs in Noida’s factories,” he says. As a job seeker, Tiwari is disappointed with the Modi government. “He promised us jobs but did not deliver,” he says. But as a voter, Tiwari has no doubts: “I will vote for Modiji. I like him. He is good for India.” Noida, the economic engine for the politically important Uttar Pradesh, has been a hub for migrant workers. It has seen its voter count grow from 12.14 lakh in 2014 to 14.9 lakh in January 2019. Of them, 1.2 lakh are first-time voters. Meanwhile, Amity University bustles with youthful energy. With 25,000 students, the mood here seems more upbeat. Campus placement has been average. A noticeable trend is that startups are showing up in large numbers. About 30% of MBA students have opted to become entrepreneurs. “Five years back, nobody here talked of startups,” says Kritika Das Gupta, who heads the placement cell. Understandably, colleges and universities have become important battleground for parties. Last Sunday, a day before ET Magazine visited Amity, BJP leader and union minister Sushma Swaraj addressed industrialists on campus. The next day, a news channel hosted a show with leaders from all major political parties and students in the audience. Gunendra Singh, 22, says he is impressed with the way the Modi government has pushed the Startup India campaign. His batchmate Aditya Narula, 21, is happy with MSME loan schemes like Mudra. Many of his friends, who have launched startups, have managed to get funding. “I too applied but didn’t get it. Still, their mentoring helped me,” he says. Now, instead of launching his startup, he has opted to take up a job. Prateeksha Tyagi, a 23-year-old MBA student, is happy with the way the Meerut expressway was built. Manya Khanna, 23, from Chhattisgarh, has landed a job with Hyundai Motor and says she is happy with what the BJP government did in her home state. Her batchmate Shubham Sagar says Modi has delivered in dramatically changing his hometown Varanasi. His support isn’t blind. “Of course, there are ifs and buts. I don’t like the communal overtones or the cow move,” says Sagar. However, of the 40-odd students this reporter met, at least 15 did not have a voter card. Co-working hub 91 SpringBoard in Sector 1, Noida, echoes the mood. It houses 190 startups with 800 members. Nikhil Mishra, 27, a serial entrepreneur, says: “Except for the PSUs, the government has little role to play in jobs. I firmly believe that there is a long curve and a short curve game. The Modi government has had just five years. We need to give them more time,” he says. Startup employee Eesha Kapoor, 25, says she is not 100% satisfied but she is sure Modiji has worked hard. “Tell me what is the alternative. There is none,” she says. Over two days, this reporter met close to 100 voters, young and old, educated and illiterate, employed and unemployed. Undoubtedly, job is a critical issue. But the job crisis hasn’t dented Modi’s appeal. Everyone has their own reasons —a decisive and muscular government, its grand ambitions, the infrastructure push, brand India, its attempts to formalise the economy, the TINA (There Is No Alternative) factor, and so on. How will the job crisis affect votes? Voters don’t seem to see a correlation between the two. Constituency -- Surat, Gujarat Back in BusinessBy Shantanu Nandan Sharma Rutvik Vaghasiya is a second-generation textile entrepreneur in Surat. The 23-year-old, who has a bachelor’s degree in business administration, is convinced that he can now expand the mill set up by his father, Nitin Bhai, a decade ago. The demand for textiles, Vaghasiya insists, would now pick up, as Surat — the second largest city in Gujarat, after Ahmedabad — is limping back to action. The city, which is a major hub of textiles and diamond processing, faced severe job loss after the double whammy of demonetisation in 2016 and the implementation of GST in 2017. While the diamond industry — with about 6,000 units sustaining 12 lakh people — shrank, it was the loss of jobs in the textiles sector that shook the city. About 300,000 employees, many from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and Chhattisgarh, became jobless when 70,000 looms out of 700,000 were sold in scrap markets after GST, according to data being prepared by the Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association. About 60,000 embroidery designers in the city, many of whom hail from the Saurashtra region, also lost their jobs, the data reveals. So, what could be the political fallout of job loss, as Surat goes to polls on April 23? Vaghasiya says job loss won’t matter much: “The majority of people will continue to vote for peace and stability. Surat is one of the safest cities in the country. We don’t want to experiment with something new and bring in potential disruptions to our businesses.” At least a dozen people ET Magazine spoke to echo the sentiment: job loss is a reality, but voters won’t experiment. However, a few among auto drivers and small vendors say they were hit the hardest and election will be an opportunity to vent their anger. In the 2017 state poll, 15 of 16 assembly seats in Surat city went in favour of the ruling BJP even when demonetisation, GST and the reservation agitation of Patidars were urgent issues. In the entire state, the ruling party did not fare that well, clinching just 99 seats in an assembly of 182, with the opposition Congress sweeping the Saurashtra region — the home of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. In Surat, the original dwellers — the Surtis, as they are called — comprise less than 10% of the city’s population today. About 60% of a population of 44.6 lakh people (according to Census 2011) have come in from other states such as Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Many of them are now staunch supporters of the BJP. A prominent BJP leader from the city, CR Patil, for instance, is a Maharashtrian. He won the 2014 Lok Sabha poll from Navasari constituency with a huge margin of 5.58 lakh votes. The city of Surat is spread across three Lok Sabha constituencies: Surat, Navasari and Bardoli. When asked about a possible dent in his vote bank because of job losses, Patil says: “Surat has not witnessed any job loss. If one mill shut, another cropped up. Anyway, this Lok Sabha poll is not about Surat, but about the nation. People are not voting for me this time. They are voting for a strong prime minister.” In the city, the BJP has shifted the political narrative from jobs to the air raids on terror camps in Pakistan, thereby packaging PM Narendra Modi as a decisive leader. In Surat — which runs on trade and entrepreneurship, not government jobs — the issue of joblessness has receded to the background. When ET Magazine asked five undergraduate students in Surat’s Veer Narmad South Gujarat University on whether they were concerned about the unemployment numbers, they all said, “No.” They were all from well-to-do families of chartered accountants, designers and diamond traders. “I chose interior design as my subject because I love creativity and I don’t need to look for a job. As an interior designer, I can be on my own,” says Saumya Khandelwal, a student. Jobs is not a poll issue for many in a city where “josh” is in running their own businesses. Constituency Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu Loyalties Intact Amid Job WorriesBy Indulekha AravindFor some, Sriperumbudur is where memories of good times lie buried. The manufacturing hub located 60 kilometres from Chennai was where Nokia and Foxconn had set up manufacturing units in 2005, employing some 9,000 permanent workers at one point. When an embattled Nokia sold its assets to Microsoft in 2013, the Sriperumbudur plant was left out because of legal complexities surrounding multiple tax demands amounting to thousands of crores. The plant was shut down in 2014 and the Foxconn unit, its major supplier, in 2015. “I was a permanent employee at Foxconn for eight years. When I left, I was earning Rs 18,000. Now I’m earning Rs 12,000 as a driver on contract,” says I Jayakumar, while shooting the breeze at a tea shop in the SIPCOT (State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu) industrial complex in Sriperumbudur before his work starts. No political party, he says, can remedy this. Sriperumbudur and Oragadam are part of the auto manufacturing belt outside Chennai, where auto and two-wheeler companies such as Hyundai, Renault Nissan, Royal Enfield and Yamaha have plants, along with a slew of units supplying parts. M Vijayabaskar, professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies, says this region, considered part of Greater Chennai, forms one of the most important hubs in Tamil Nadu in terms of job creation, along with Coimbatore. According to the Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy, Tamil Nadu’s unemployment rate was 1.4% in February 2019, considerably lower than the 7.2% nationally. Workers here say jobs are “100%” an important issue. They bring up the lack of job security, low salaries and the inability to find jobs commensurate with educational qualifications. Diploma- and degree-holders in engineering, who work in low-skill jobs, for instance, are dime-a-dozen. Like Vinod N, rushing to make it to his 3 pm shift as a machine technician in an auto major. “Note the point: I am a BE in mechanical engineering. But I am earning Rs 14,000 a month in my current job,” he says. Or Nandini S, who has a diploma in electrical engineering but is working in the quality department of a cable manufacturer, earning Rs 12,000 a month. “We have to work 8-hour shifts, standing,” says the 21-year-old, taking shelter from the fierce midday sun while waiting to hail a shared cab to work. Others rue companies’ preference for contract labour from outside the state and trainees replaced every two years, to quell worker unrest. In the past one year, employees of Royal Enfield, Yamaha and Hyundai have gone on strike for better wages. Yet, when they enter the polling booth next month, none of this will matter. S Chandrashekhar, for instance, says he has always voted for the AIADMK though former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death has left him unsure about who he will vote for this time. He says he cleared the railway recruitment exams but could not join because he was unable to afford the bribe he was asked to pay. Praveen N, a 21-year-old trainee at a motorcycle manufacturer who says none of his batchmates from the ITI (industrial training institute) he attended have found jobs, will be casting his debut vote for the DMK, the party his family votes for. Rahul Kumar, waiting in queue to enter a manufacturing plant in Oragadam where he has been a trainee for two years, intends to return to his hometown in Patna to cast his vote for Modi because the last five years, in his view, have been very good. “No party can be successful in job creation,” he says. Quite a few locals voice support for former minister TR Baalu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam candidate from Sriperumbudur who won the seat in 2009, before he shifted to Thanjavur in the last Lok Sabha elections. He will be contesting against NDA candidate A Vaithilingam from the Pattali Makkal Katchi. And while Tamil Nadu is considered a tough nut to crack for the BJP, which has just one Lok Sabha MP in the state, Modi finds a few backers. “Educated people support Modi,” says Suresh K, a supervisor at a twowheeler plant. But there is a general air of resignation when discussing parties, promises and how the state will vote next month. The cynical consensus— people will vote for the candidate who pays them the most. Constituency -- Agra, UPReeling from Job LossesBy Prerna Katiyar At Heeng ki Mandi, the hub of Agra’s famous footwear market, one is greeted by the sight of lockedup stores and piles of unsold stock. Traders claim half the shops and factories have shut down. “Business has halved; half of the shoe-making factories have shut down,” laments Gagan Das Ramani, president of the Agra Shoe Federation. The man who has spent a good part of his life spearheading the leather industry here has seen better days. The shoe industry that dates back to the Mughal era caters to an estimated 65% of country’s footwear demand and 25% of shoe exports, according industry estimates. With leather shoes available for around Rs 500, Agra footwear is seen as great value for money. Since they are handmade unlike the machine-made ones of Delhi or Ballabhgarh, they also offer more designs. Till Partition, the footwear here was made by Dalit families and traded by Muslims. After Partition, Sindhis and Punjabis came into the trade. Business was booming. Annual sales were to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore until about two years back, according to the federation. With cow vigilantism, demonetisation and GST, the footwear business has nearly come to a standstill. “I know of craftsmen who have left shoemaking and picked up menial jobs like driving e-rickshaws for livelihood,” says Ramani. Original GST slab for footwear was 5% for shoes up to Rs 500 and 18% for pricier ones. Subsequently, the rate was cut to 12% for footwear costing more than Rs 500. “Under the VAT (value added tax) regime, there was no tax on it. Additionally, the imposition of 28% GST on raw material has been a double whammy. Thousands associated with the industry are now jobless,” says Harsh Vanjani, a member of the Agra Shoe Federation. Vaibhav Mishra, 21, had a dream of getting a “stable” government job like many others. A 2016 science graduate from Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University he applied for a couple of jobs immediately after college but to no avail. He now works in the accounts department of Kripa Karan Shoe at Dayalbagh and is also preparing for the Staff Selection Commission exams. “I don’t blame anyone else. It is strange — the number of vacancies have risen yet the youth is not getting adequate jobs. Irrespective of local candidate, I’ll vote for Modi. He is the youth’s first choice.” Agra produces nearly 200 million pairs of shoes annually in an industry that employs a quarter of the city’s population, according to Fair Labour Association (FLA), an organisation that promotes workers’ rights. “The shoe industry was once the lifeline of the city; today the industry is on life support,” says Narendra Pushnani, an Agra-based shoe exporter. Aved Khan, 37, has been a marble craftsman in the Gokulpura area. Today, he has left his skilled job and is looking for any work that pays him enough to feed his family. Traders claim imposition of 18% GST has hit the industry hard. “The trade has turned unattractive. I’m not the only one who was forced to leave the business. Earlier, there were close to 70,000 craftsmen; now there are just 15,000. I will vote for the mahagatbandhan candidate,” says Khan. Sunil Kumar Verma, president of Agra Handicrafts Association, points to wider political ramifications. “It’s mostly Muslims who work as marble craftsmen. 2014 was different. This time, most of the minorities will not vote for the BJP.” The BJP has replaced MP Ram Shankar Katheria with UP minister SP Singh Baghel. The SP-BSP-RLD alliance has fielded Manoj Kumar Soni. Making the fight triangular will be Congress candidate and former IRS officer Preeta Harit. Constituency -- Pune, MaharashtraFence SittersBy Suman LayakPune offers a variety of employment opportunities, and job prospects often sit side by side with hopelessness. Political opinion is likewise divided. Between 17-year-old Alisha Pathan (pictured above), an apprentice at Tata Motors Skill Development Centre, and 34-year-old Harpreet Saluja, an out-of-job techie who drives for Uber, there is hope and desperation. Alisha and her colleague Prithviraj Ghadge at Tata Motors are still not eligible for vote but they feel prospects have improved in five years, especially for women. Just as there are voices of support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP, there is dissent too. Aspiring beautician Komal Korda is learning the tricks of the trade at Aundh Lighthouse, a centre started by the Pune Municipal Corporation and Pune City Connect, a non-profit with corporate backing. Korda is joining duty at a beauty parlour on April 1 for a stipend of Rs 3,000 a month and hopes to set up her own shop in a year. She was a BJP supporter but now feels that on creating jobs, the government has not kept its word. So she will vote for change. “Many of my friends were selected for government jobs after ads were published and exams were conducted but they are yet to get appointment letters.” And there are others like Saluja, who are circumspect. A member of the Forum for IT Employees, a union of IT/BPO staffers, he is fighting a case against his former employer in the labour court. He wants a change in legislation and says he will vote for the party that can protect his ilk. Contrast this with Gaurav Sisodia, a 27-year-old engineer who switched to an IT biggie from a mid-sized tech company last year after teaching himself Java through free resources. “I will go with the development agenda and vote for the BJP candidate.” Pune is an education hub and attracts students from across India and the job scene here is seeing a transition. Instead of hiring permanent staffers, the manufacturing units are opting for contractual and outsourced models. Jobs have become diverse, but permanent employment is decreasing. Suruchi Wagh, cofounder of Jombay, a B2B human resource startup, says the onus is on employees to upgrade their skill sets, especially if they are in the IT/BPO sector. “Permanent employment, as we understand it, is going down. But livelihood options are on the way up….And this has nothing to do with politics,” says Pradeep Bhargava, president of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture. Pune’s youngsters, who have understood the transition, are adapting quickly. Yet, politically, many are undecided. Atul Bhandare, a 21-year-old from Bopali, who has passed Class 10, did a bakery course at Aundh Lighthouse and landed a job as a baker at Café Peter. In his spare time, he also works as an electrician’s assistant. Bhandare’s family members are traditional voters of the Nationalist Congress Party but he says he will wait before deciding which party to vote for. Rohan Gaikwad, a commerce graduate who found a job at a BPO unit, says his sympathies are with the BJP but he is yet to decide which party to back. “Parties just want our votes.” It may be worth the wait. While the BJP has replaced incumbent MP Anil Shiroke with Girish Bapat as its candidate, the Congress is yet to name his challenger. Constituency -- Ludhiana, PunjabSkill Gap Hurts Job ProspectsBy Ishani DuttaguptaIt is not just the top manufacturing hub in Punjab but also a centre for small industries in India. So it is not surprising that business leaders in Ludhiana are more concerned about finding skilled people rather than raising the red flag on unemployment. Punjab’s Ghar Ghar Rozgaar & Karobaar mission, launched in November last year, was aimed at addressing the skill gap in small and medium enterprises. Pradeep Kumar Agrawal, deputy commissioner, Ludhiana, is not willing to comment specifically on the impact of the mission on the upcoming elections since the Election Commission’s model code of conduct is in place. “However, industries here have been struggling to find people with the right skills. And now, the district bureau of employment and enterprises is trying to connect jobseekers with employers through a new website, counselling sessions as well as job fairs,” he adds. Many business leaders say the state government has just made a start and a lot remains to be done on the jobs front. “Most companies here are facing high attrition rate and are looking for the right people for various kinds of jobs, even as youth in the villages and small towns around here face unemployment. We are even willing to partner with the government to train people,” says Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking and president of auto parts manufacturing group, New Swan Enterprises. Jaskaran Singh is one of the lucky ones who got employed recently. The 20-year-old was among the 15,000 who applied for a job at a fair held in Ludhiana in February. He landed a job with Ludhiana’s City Bus Service, earning about Rs 10,000 a month. “I was helping out at our family farm after I finished Class 12 but I was constantly looking for a job also. Getting this job was a big break for me. I feel that positive steps like job fairs will play an important role in helping young people in deciding which party to vote for,” he says. Women make up a significant number of the labour force in the factories across Ludhiana, and they are likely to play a significant role in deciding who will represent their constituency in Parliament. “I have a permanent job in a good company where women can work without any fear,” says Jyoti Sharma, 35, who earns around Rs 10,000 per month, working the wheel assembly line at Avon Cycles, Ludhiana’s second largest bicycle manufacturer. But the softspoken single mother of two children is aware that her income is not enough. “As a single mother who must think of the future of her children, I will be closely watching which political party addresses the issues of employment and wages.” The Vardhman group, one of the largest manufacturing companies in Ludhiana, employs 10,500 people in Punjab, including 3,700 women. “We employ many women in our factories and address the issue of their welfare in a big way, including running four hostels for them,” says DL Sharma, director, Vardhman Textiles. But to deepen the pool of talent available to employers in Ludhiana, he says the central and state governments need to take more meaningful steps. Elections are more than a month and a half away and none of the political parties have declared their candidates for this constituency. No matter who contests the polls in this bicycles and knitwear hub, jobs and employability will certainly be important issues. Constituencies: Bangalore Central & Bangalore North, Karnataka Choke CollarBy Rahul SachitanandBellandur and Peenya, once sleepy backwaters of Bengaluru, provide contrasting views of the city, which is known as an employment magnet. Bellandur, in southeast Bengaluru, is a throbbing hub of large technology and startup offices and campuses. Peenya, in the northwest, is a grungy industrial suburb with thousands of small manufacturers crammed into a warren of roads. Factories often operate out of cramped facilities here, a far cry from the glass and chrome buildings of Bellandur. Those working in Bellandur grumble about choked roads. During peak time, a vehicle might take an hour to cover 5 km. Cab aggregator drivers shudder when they get a trip to this area. A lake next door, foaming over with industrial effluent, keeps this borough in the news. Nevertheless, places like Bellandur, Whitefield and Electronic City house sought-after offices for technology coders. A significant chunk of voters here are young people or are first or second timers. The major contestants in the locality in Bangalore Central Lok Sabha constituency are incumbent MP PC Mohan (BJP) and Rizwan Arshad (Congress). Actor Prakash Raj is also contesting this seat as an independent. From his office building in Bellandur, Arpit Bhatt, 32, an engineer with a multinational networking and security firm, is keenly watching the election drama. He has felt the pangs of unemployment, albeit in the US. When he graduated from his master’s programme in 2009, the financial meltdown was in full flow. Barely 30% of his classmates bagged internships. He could not. “I want to vote for candidates who have a vision for key issues such as jobs and job creation and have the capabilities to execute it.” Lok Sabha polls candidates should provide a broader framework for the country’s progress rather than promise to solve Bengaluru’s local issues, says the engineer. The city — once a magnet for technical and blue-collar workers thanks to staterun firms such as ITI, HAL, BEL and BEML — saw a spurt in jobs from an assortment of sectors. Bengaluru was a favoured destination for technology behemoths, too. But technology outsourcing’s sheen as a pre-eminent employer has now dulled. Rapidly changing technology needs and tightening immigration norms have slowed job and salary growth. This has also affected indirect employment in this IT hub. Some 34 km to the northwest, Peenya houses several industries based here for decades. There are some 6,000 small enterprises crammed into a warren of roads in the industrial area, employing as many as 800,000 people, according to Peenya Industries Association. Companies in this cluster generate over Rs 12,000 crore in revenue, it says. Despite the change in work-scape, the primary issue is the same. Over the past couple of years, jobs in this primarily cash-driven industrial hub dried up due to demonetisation and GST. “Peenya continues to be a hub of employment for south India,” says Giri MM, president of Peenya Industries Association. “We business owners require at least 100,000 people for our factories.” But Giri wants actual employability, rather than empty job generation boasts. “We hire poorly trained technical talent and invest our resources to train them.” The primary contestants from the locality in Bangalore North constituency are the BJP’s DV Sadananda Gowda and the Congress’ Krishna Byre Gowda. Two streets away from the cool offices of Peenya Industries Association, M Rajanna, 50, a blue-collar worker in a small steel fabrication unit, says the job generation claims made by ruling party politicians are bunkum. Dressed in dark-blue oil-soaked overalls, he takes a moment to wipe his brow with a rag. “These are all empty promises that politicians have made over time and this party (BJP) is no different. We tend to ignore these claims and vote for the candidate that at least promises the most changes to where we live and work.” He rushes away to grab a quick lunch before resuming work. Several small-scale units here have been operating on a knife edge after demonetisation and GST. If business dives, employment dries up. Rajanna and people like him are taking it one day at a time.

Rs 90 lakh seized in demonetised note exchange scam; six held | Bengaluru News - Times of India,"BENGALURU: In a demonetised currency exchange racket, six persons were arrested on Friday and notes worth Rs 90 lakh in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination were seized from them. The scam came to light a day after Revathi, a resident of Vijayanagar, filed a fake robbery case against five co-accused — Vinod Kumar, Rakesh, Ravi alias Ravindra, Renuka Prasad and Basavaraju. Revathi alleged that Vinod Kumar and Rakesh robbed her of Rs 13 lakh near Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, on March 26. Initially, she claimed she runs a vegetable export business with her friend Santosh Kumar. The duo wanted a physiotherapy course seat for Santosh’s sister. Vinod said his friend Rakesh could arrange a seat for Rs 13 lakh. Gang used to collect demonetised notesVinod asked her to meet him near IISc, snatched her bag containing the money and escaped. Police tracked down Vinod and Rakesh on Friday and questioned them. They said the money was in demonetised notes. Police said, “Revathi confessed she filed a false complaint because Vinod and Rakesh had not exchanged her old notes. Revathi’s money had been given to Ravindra and when we searched his residence in Dasarahalli near Peenya, we found Rs 90 lakh in demonetised currency.” Based on Ravindra’s information, police arrested Renuka Prasad and Basavaraj. All the accused are businessmen or real estate agents, cops said. The gang led by Ravindra would collect demonetised money from people in Bengaluru and exchange them for new currency notes from a person identified as Praveen in Chennai. “We sent a team to Chennai to nab Praveen and figure out what he does with demonetised currency,” a police officer said. All six accused were produced before a magistrate on Saturday and taken into police custody for three days. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Lens on shady bank deals in shell companies - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The tax department has launched an intensive drive to verify suspicious bank transactions in companies struck off from the official records post-demonetisation for not carrying out any business activity. Sources said tax field formations have been ordered to carry out strict verification of the bank transactions in such companies as the government clamps down on shell companies as part of its overall fight against black money. ""Bank records will be scrutinised and the details to be matched against the companies. This is to make sure that these companies are not using the banking channel. Officers across the country have been asked to verify the records,"" said an official, who did not wish to be identified. The official said this was part of the overall strategy of shutting out shell companies. The tax department wants to make sure that the banking system is still not being used to park illegal funds. livebudget updatesmoreupdates""All transactions will be scrutinised and matched against record of the companies,"" said the official, detailing the drive, which has been undertaken. The banking channel had been misused during the demonetisation period to park illegal funds and tough action had been taken against several offenders. The government had informed Parliament in December that 2.26 lakh companies had been struck off from the registrar of companies records as on December 31, 2017 as they had not been carrying out any business activity for a long time. During 2018-19, 225,910 such companies had been identified under Section 248 of the Companies Act and after due diligence names of 100,150 companies had been struck off. Section 248 allows deletion of a company's registration for not undertaking any business activity for a long time.

Why BJP is eyeing a breach in Didi’s West Bengal fortress - Times of India,"KOLKATA: In the last Lok Sabha election, when the Modi wave carried BJP and NDA to a brute majority in the Lok Sabha, BJP won just two of Bengal's 42 Lok Sabha seats. It was just one seat more than the 2009 election, when it won only Darjeeling, but the preview to an emerging story lay in the BJP's vote share: from just 6.1 per cent in 2009, it rose to 16.8 per cent in 2014. Five years on, BJP is talking up Bengal as one of the states where it will make gains. At a rally in North Bengal's Alipurduar on Friday, BJP chief   Amit Shah said the party will win 23 seats   . On the other hand, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who has emerged nationwide as the face of anti-BJP opposition, has   set an all-42 target   for her party. There is no doubt that BJP is a growing force in Bengal. In the 2016 assembly elections, it increased its vote share (10.3 per cent) to within touching distance of Congress (12.4 per cent). In terms of seats, the party bagged only three of the 294 in the assembly, but compared with 2011 when it won no seats, its vote share was up by 6 per cent. And as BJP grew, CPM suffered the heaviest losses - in a state it ruled for three decades, CPM's vote share fell by 10 per cent or more in both the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2016 Assembly polls. In subsequent polls, BJP has improved further. The party came second in municipal elections such as Durgapur and Cooper's Camp in Nadia and was ahead of CPM and Congress taken together in the 2018 panchayat polls. But it's not the CPM or Congress which BJP needs to worry about in Bengal. Mamata's Trinamool Congress bagged nearly 40% of the votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha election and a whopping 45.3 per cent in the assembly polls of 2016. It improved its vote share significantly as well in both elections, sealing its position as the overwhelmingly dominant political power in Bengal, where it currently holds 34 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats and 211 of the 294 assembly seats. While Mamata focuses her attack on the Modi government on issues like demonetisation, intolerance, and using central agencies against the opposition, the BJP camp is galvanised too because it feels it has sensed a ""groundswell"" against Trinamool. It wants to turn the tables on Mamata riding the post-Balakot sentiment; it is aiming at a counter-consolidation of the majority community against Trinamool's perceived ""minority appeasement"" and ""vote bank"" politics. The perception is growing in some areas, manifest in communal incidents in at least 10 places in post-2014 Bengal. In the Cooch Behar and Uluberia Lok Sabha bypolls and Kanthi and Noapara assembly bypolls, BJP made significant gains and came second. Some of the seats where BJP is eyeing a good show, if things work to plan, are Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, Raiganj, Balurghat, Malda (North), Krishnanagar, Ranaghat, Purulia, Midnapore, Asansol, Kolkata (North), Howrah, Barrackpore and Bongaon. Complete coverage: Lok Sabha electionsBut BJP is yet to gain the mass base and organisational muscle to take on Trinamool in many seats. It has eroded Left and Congress vote banks but is yet to make a dent in the Trinamool's ascending vote share, except in pockets. The party had a 20 per cent and above vote share in as many 12 Lok Sabha seats in 2014 even at the height of the Modi wave. After Balakot, BJP has often used ""anti-India"" and pro-Pakistan"" labels for the opposition. Mamata, meanwhile, has her problems. The opposition hasn't united in Bengal; Left and Congress continue to be her vocal political rivals. There's also wariness on disgruntled Trinamool workers and violent intraparty feuds. Security has been increased for as many as 17 Trinamool leaders, showing that the party is not confident about its own men. Bengal will vote in all seven phases. And the voter will have a lot of time to think. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."
Income tax officials race against time to mop up Rs 1.6 lakh crore - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Income tax officials have a busy weekend ahead as they race against time to mop up Rs 1.6 lakh crore, which is around 13% of this year's target, with just two days for the end of the financial year. And, with GST collections also looking shaky, the finance ministry brass has its task cut out to meet the fiscal deficit target for the current financial year. Officials said change in tax slabs is seen to be a major reason for a shortfall in GST, although collections in March are expected to top Rs 1 lakh crore. Despite some savings expected from schemes such as farmer income support, officials are complaining of the unduly high target set for them. ""The Rs 50,000-crore addition to the target in the revised estimates was like a balancing entry to keep the overall fiscal deficit target manageable. There was remote possibility of achieving the target and we were not taken into confidence,"" said an officer. In the revised estimates for the current year, the government has budgeted for a fiscal deficit of 3.4% of GDP, compared to 3.3% in the budget estimates. Tax officials said collecting over Rs 1.6 lakh crore in two days is not going to be easy, given that the last three days of 2017-18 fiscal had generated around Rs 60,000 crore and that too came after a nudge to the corporate sector to pay up at the end of the year. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesWhile large taxpayers are being tapped to pay some taxes in ""advance"", other steps are also being initiated to ensure that the collections are as close as possible to the target. Among the centres, Mumbai is seen to be lagging in terms of the overall growth rate, with Delhi logging the highest growth rate behind Dehradun's 45% among the regions (see table ). Also, Hyderabad has overtaken Pune to be the fifth largest region for the I-T department. Senior officials are, however, more hopeful, saying that targets will be met. Besides, they pointed out that the overall growth is a big positive as it comes on the back of two years of stupendous growth and points to widening of the tax base, post-demonetisation.

" Oxfam flags gender pay gap, lack of quality jobs in India | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Lack of quality jobs and increasing wage disparity are key markers of inequality in the Indian labour market, Oxfam India's latest report, 'Mind The Gap - State of Employment in India', has said. Pointing to a decline in rural jobs, the report also says regressive social norms continue to hamper women's participation in the workforce. On an average, women are paid 34 per cent less than similarly qualified male workers for performing the same tasks. In 2015, 92 per cent of women and 82 per cent of men earned a monthly wage less than Rs 10,000 in India, the report says. ""Despite the rhetoric of job creation and ensuring gender justice, ground reality is sobering. The report draws particular attention to women being left out of the economic growth narrative, a consequence of poor policy choices and lack of investment in social security and infrastructure,"" Oxfam India CEO Amitabh Behar said. Highlighting questions over India's growth data and emphasising that they do not reflect in the growth of jobs, it also says the largest number of jobs were generated in the unorganised sector. Job generation was adversely impacted, the report says, after demonetisation, and hit the women workforce most. Women, it says, were forced to move out of the labour force to make way for men to get the few jobs that were available. Post-demonetisation period also saw a drop in households with two or more persons employed. Between January and October 2016, households where two or more persons were employed was 34.8%. This dropped to 31.8% post-demonetisation, with women workers becoming the first casualties of job losses. The report also presents a grim picture of social realities, saying caste and class continue to play crucial roles in determining employment for men and women, especially in stigmatised vocations like sanitation, rag-picking, and jobs in the leather industry. In rural India, for instance, traditional occupations continue to be determined by castes. Women belonging to the Mahadalit community, for example, assist with child-birth, while richer Baniyas own shops. Discrimination also exists in terms of market participation; milk produced by Dalit families, for instance, fetches a lower price. The Oxfam report, however, suggests economic factors can be improved by way of policy interventions. It advocates a shift in development focus towards labour intensive sectors to create more jobs and pushes for better work conditions to make jobs more inclusive. The report also pushes for substantially higher investments in health and education to improve productivity. ""National Achievement Survey found students from state education boards do considerably worse than those of independent national boards that cater to the richer, better schools. Even within the public education system, there are glaring inequalities in educational investment. Government sponsored Kendriya Vidyalayas (KV) spend Rs 27,000 per student whereas non KV government schools spend a mere Rs 3000 per student,"" the report says.

"Rahul Gandhi:   We will 'remonetise' what Modi 'demonetised', says Rahul Gandhi | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said the 'Nyay' scheme will remonetise what Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised and asserted that his party's anti-poverty programme has thrown the BJP into total disarray. In an exclusive interview to PTI ahead of the 17th general election beginning April 11, Rahul Gandhi said the 'Nyay' scheme has the twin objectives of giving money to the 20 per cent poorest families in India and remonetising the economy ""damaged"" by demonetisation. Rahul Gandhi’s NYAY historic, BJP anti-poor: Congress""What the PM has done over the past five years is to remove all money from the economy with failed policies like demonetisation and a poorly executed Gabbar Singh Tax (GST). Informal sectors have been badly hit. Income plan: Economists consulted, says Rahul; uphill task, feel experts""The aim of the 'Nyay' scheme is two-fold. First is to guarantee a minimum income to the bottom 20 per cent families. The second is to remonetise the economy that has been demonetised by Modiji,"" Rahul Gandhi said. The Congress chief said there is a reason why the party christened the scheme 'Nyay', which translates to justice in Hindi. ""There is another aspect to calling the scheme 'Nyay'. Why have we chosen to call this scheme 'Justice'? Because over the last five years, Mr Narendra Modi has simply snatched from poor and given nothing back. ""He has taken away from the farmers, he has snatched from the small and medium businesses, he's taken away from the unemployed youth, he has extinguished the savings of mothers and sisters of this country. We want to return to India's deprived sections what Modiji has snatched from them,” Gandhi said. Terming 'Nyay' (Nyuntam Aay Yojana) a ""game changer"" and a ""final assault"" on poverty, Rahul Gandhi said the scheme is ""fiscally perfectly doable” and will not be implemented ""rashly like demonetization and GST of the BJP"". Asked about apprehensions of some economists that 'Nyay', which entails an expenditure of Rs 3.6 lakh crore annually, could aggravate India's fiscal deficit position, Gandhi said, ""No, that's not right."" He said the party consulted a large number of economists and experts, studied numerous papers and other research material on this subject and run an extensive financial modelling exercise before deciding to include the plan in its Lok Sabha manifesto. To a question on the scheme being prima facie populist, Rahul said ""it is not a populist measure as projected by some critics"". ""If giving out Rs 3.5 lakh crore to 15 people by Narendra Modi is not considered populist, why should this be as it is aimed at benefitting the poor,"" he said. ""Is it only the crony capitalist friends of Mr Modi who are to benefit from government schemes? I'm only asking for fairness, for justice, or 'nyay' for India's poor. There's nothing populist about that,"" he countered. Taking a swipe at Modi, who announced the demonetisation of high value currency notes in a surprise move in November 2016, Rahul Gandhi said, ""We're not rash. We don't take steps like demonetisation and GST without consultations, without conferring with the experts. We have vetted this, tested this, and fiscally 'Nyay' as a scheme is completely doable."" The Congress president did not give a time line on when the party planned to make India poverty free and said 'Nyay' will first be tested through a pilot to ""smoothen out any flaws"". ""We're not going to do it the way GST was done. We are first going to run a short pilot project to smoothen out any flaws in the implementation process and then roll it out nationwide. We're also going to set down a robust way of identifying the beneficiaries, so that no deserving family is left out,"" he said. Asked if the pilot will be run in Congress-ruled states, Gandhi said experts will decide on that. ""This is for the experts to decide. In the 10 years of the Congress-UPA government, we took 14 crore people out of poverty net. Our goal now is to finish the job,"" he said. Gandhi added that 20 per cent to 22 per cent families are living in poverty even today. Many of them have been pushed into this cycle by the prime minister's demonetisation scheme and 'Gabbar Singh Tax' (GST), he noted. ""Our goal is to completely eliminate poverty from India,"" he said, describing 'Nyay' as the final assault on poverty.

"Meet the real chowkidars: No hashtags, only hardships | Delhi News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: For Mahesh Kumar Vishwakarma (45), the day starts before dawn. It takes him two hours to cycle from home in Deoli to his workplace at Green Park, so he has to start early. He is a security guard at a bank ATM — a chowkidar — and the long commute isn’t his only worry. Vishwakarma earns Rs 13,000 every month. Using his bicycle saves him around Rs 2,000 in commute expenses. “I spend this money on my children’s education. Rent takes another Rs 3,000 and the household expenses swallow up the rest of my earnings,” Vishwakarma mumbles. “I haven’t been able to save a single paisa after working as a guard 12 hours a day for the past 14 years.” His only hope now, he says, are his children, aged eight and five, who he wishes will never have to work as a chowkidar. That’s the kind of tough life that security guards or chowkidars lead. The term chowkidar has suddenly taken on a political colour in election season with netas either adopting it or mocking it. But the fad hasn’t altered the ground reality for the real chowkidars, among the most vulnerable labour groups in the capital. They work 12-hour shifts to protect ATMs, restaurants, housing societies, etc, but get little money and almost no leave. Ask them what they think about the current political discourse around the term for their employment, and you get amusement, pessimism and even anger in reaction. Down the road from Green Park is Safdarjung Enclave where Mahipal Rawat (51), who was in the Border Security Force for 24 years, earns even less than Vishwakarma: Rs 10,500. He is aware of how exploitative contractors have kept the wages low in his current job sector. He can’t do much about it though. “My children are grown up so I can manage my expenses,” Rawat said. “But imagine surviving on this salary for someone just starting a family. And there’s no regulation. Signatures are often fudged, records are tampered with, but the regulatory authorities are nowhere to be seen.” Right after demonetisation, these security guards became the public faces of the banking system’s failures, bearing the brunt of public ire for no fault of theirs. They were promised extra money to work double shifts. When the crisis ebbed, they realised they had been taken for a ride. “We were assured of bonus at the end of the crisis, but when things returned to normal, the security companies denied giving us such assurances,” Vishwakarma claimed. Most of the security guards in Delhi come from small towns in eastern UP and Bihar. Easy gun licences and availability of firearms have made towns like Darbhanga,Mainpuri and Munger the largest sources of manpower for this sector. But with low pay and many mouths to feed back home, these guards go to extremes, even compromising on basic needs, to save money. Lakshmi Kumar (31) works at a restaurant serving Northeastern delicacies in Green Park. “I sleep at a nearby temple and eat at the restaurant. Of my Rs 13,000 salary, I usually send up to Rs 11,000 to my family in Darbhanga,” he said. Bijender Singh (46) from Mainpuri, who guards a post office near ITO, also sleeps in office to avoid paying room rent. And for over four years, he has worked two jobs to make some money. “An eight-hour shift at the post office followed by a four-hour shift at an electricity billing counter was doable,” he said. “But the companies increased the shift duration to 12 hours. It was back-breaking work so I had to stop.” Even though the minimum wage in Delhi is Rs 13,500, the salary of security guards varies between Rs 9,500 and Rs 15,000. Those guarding banks are slightly better off than those on duty at residential colonies and multistorey houses. “Guarding houses is the least paying in the sector,” informed Mahesh Kripal, who works at an upscale locality near Yusuf Sarai market. “We have to stand in rain and sun without supporting infrastructure. Despite this, we get Rs 5,000 less than others.” Ram Babu (44), Kripal’s counterpart at a neighbouring house, said on paper he gets Rs 28,000, but the “in-hand” pay comes to just Rs 11,000. The contractors fudge signatures to manipulate accounts, he complained. “Why don’t they raid and scrutinise the records of the security agencies?” The insensitivity of those whose homes they guard adds insult to injury. “Our only point of contact is the agency. Guards get changed after every eight hours. But the residents don’t even offer us a cup of tea,” Babu said. Can the ‘chowkidar’ discourse change all this? They hope it will.

"P Chidambaram: Voters identify BJP with demonetisation, GST | - Times of India","CHENNAI: The BJP will be remembered for a flawed implementation of GST and the demonetisation exercise, said former Union finance minister P Chidambaram on Wednesday. None of the promises made before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was implemented, he told reporters at the Congress headquarters while explaining the “implementability” of Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY) scheme. “The promise of depositing ?15 lakh into bank accounts, doubling of farmers income, demonetisation and a flawed GST. If anyone mentions BJP, only these four things come to mind. By implementing the GST, Prime Minister Narendra Modi destroyed the micro, small and medium enterprises in the country. When people think of BJP, what comes to mind is that they shook the statistics to show that they have produced growth,” alleged Chidambaram. “I request all reporters to come to New Delhi and be there for at least one week and you will know that there is no central government or Union cabinet. It is only Modi and Modi alone in New Delhi,” said Chidambaram. Referring to NYAY, the Congress’s minimum income guarantee scheme and its impact on inflation, Chidambaram said the party’s manifesto will explain everything in detail. “Before implementing the scheme an expert committee will be set up to go into all the issues. Even during the implemention of the MGNERGS, the current finance minister Arun Jaitley said it was not possible to implement the scheme but now they are stating that it is the best antipoverty scheme,” said Chidambaram. Asked how the Congress arrived at the figure of 5 crore below-the-poverty-line families, Chidambaram said there was enough data gathered by state governments through crop insurance scheme and others. “Rolling out NYAY will not subsume the present subsidy schemes for the poor. We have also calculated that it will cost less than 2% of the GDP when the scheme is implemented. GDP is expected to grow to ?400 lakh crore in 2024,” said Chidambaram. Meanwhile, DMK president M K Stalin in a statement said by June 3 the new scheme for people under the poverty line will be rolled out after Congress-DMK government is sworn in. “Niti Aayog deputy chairman Rajiv Kumar, who has turned a BJP cadre, has criticised the scheme, but it was the UPA government which waived the farmers’ loans and also implemented the MGNREGS in the past and we will do the same with this scheme too,” said Stalin.

He nodded as Vaiko, campaigning for DMK candidate for Chennai Central Dayanidhi Maran, spoke about his love for Tamil and criticized the Centre and state governments. “I have been a member of the DMK for long and was actively involved in campaigns for years. My health has deteriorated but there was no way I could miss the campaign,” said Jeevabharathi. While all speakers touched upon many issues that affected the lives of people in the past five years, Vaiko’s criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the state government set the tone for the DMK-led alliance’s campaign in this venue, popular for election rallies. Whenever the MDMK chief came down on Modi, recollecting how the common man was left in the dark postdemonetization and how unemployment rates had soared, the gathering applauded. “TheMay22shooting of anti-Sterlite protesters in Tuticorin, which claimed the lives of 13 people, was a ‘pre-meditated cold-blooded murder’. The PM neither reacted nor condoled the loss of innocent lives. The PM did not express condolences for the death of 89 people when Cyclone Gaja wreaked havoc in TN,” he said. “The corrupt state government has become a slave to the Centre.” Vaiko also spoke about the Pollachi sexual abuse case and murders at Kodanadu estate and ended his speech, urging the electorate to vote for the DMK-Congress alliance and establish a government that would uphold social justice. The campaign had earlier begun on a dull note at Palaniandavar Street in Perambur, where Vaiko reached the venue two hours late.

Currency in circulation as percentage of GDP declines since DeMo: Finance ministry official - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Currency in circulation as percentage of GDP declined by over 1 percentage point to 10.48 per cent in the two years after demonetisation, a finance ministry official said. The government had demonetised currency notes of 500 and 1000 denomination on November 8, 2016, to check black money.  ""In terms of GDP, notes in circulation declined from 11.55 per cent as on November 8, 2016, to 10.48 per cent as on November 8, 2018, reflecting that it has actually contributed in reducing the currency in circulation,"" an official said. This reflects a decline of 1 percentage point or 100 basis points.  Post note ban, Rs 15.31 lakh crore worth demonetised notes were deposited in banks within a stipulated time. This was 99.3 per cent of the Rs 15.41 lakh crore worth of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in circulation on November 8, 2016.  One of the objectives of demonetisation was to reduce cash-economy and encourage digital mode of payment. livebudget updatesmoreupdates The notes in circulation had recorded an average growth rate of 14.51 per cent year-on-year since October 2014 to October 2016.

"Small industries in ruins after GST, Demonetisation, says Congress on Day 1 of Parivartan Yatra | Gurgaon News - Times of India","GURUGRAM: If the first day of Congress’s Parivartan Yatra is any indication, their poll plank in the state could be a full-fledged attempt to project rival BJP as responsible for dividing people of the state in the name of caste and community. Starting off the yatra from the Delhi-Gurgaon border on Tuesday morning, AICC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad said, “It’s time to teach a lesson to BJP for sowing seeds of discord,” adding BJP has destroyed farmers and duped the youth by promising them jobs. Even the state government’s most publicised slogan, ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’, has failed to usher in change, he said. After stops at Rajiv Chowk, Badshapur and Sohna in the city, the yatra travelled through Nuh, Tauru, Daruhera, Bawal, Naiwali, Kund, Ateli, Mirzapur and Narnaul. Addressing a meeting at Rajiv Chowk, he said, “Not only has demonetisation and GST destroyed small businesses and industries, they have brought suffering to every citizen. Citizens have gained nothing from the BJP government’s empty promises, barring greater social rifts,” adding, “Parivartan Yatra begins in Haryana from today. The whole country wants to replace the BJP government in the Centre.” Criticising the Narendra Modi government, he said that in the five years it has been in power, the government has only caused disappointment among farmers and youth, adding unemployment has increased, while nothing has been done to empower women. Azad also claimed that since BJP came to power in the state, Haryana turned “violent”. Senior Congress leader and Rohtak MP, Deepender Singh Hooda, told TOI BJP has failed to deliver the promises it made to woo voters in the last general elections. “Instead, BJP’s divisive politics has pushed the state backward in the last five years, leaving Congress the responsibility of offering people the alternative,” said Hooda. He said the Yatra is aimed at making people aware of BJP’s politics of ‘divide and lies’, and encourage them to get rid of the misgovernance. With Lok Sabha elections across the state scheduled on May 12, he promised that the leaders will hold public meetings to uplift the morale of party workers. On factionalism in the party, Deepender said leaders will present an united front to take on BJP in the forthcoming elections. “There might be differences of opinion on organisational matters, but there is no factionalism as far as ideology is concerned. That’s why all senior leaders have come together for this yatra, organised by the coordination committee under the leadership of the former CM,” he said, adding, “I hope minor differences are resolved and the party gets victory in the polls.” Finally, former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda launched an all-out attack against the BJP government. “Haryana’s farmers are not getting a fair price for their produce. The government has put several pre-conditions on crops already covered under MSP. Prices of fertilizers have gone up, while their package weight has gone down, making it twice the loss for farmers. Tractor parts, fertilizers, insecticides have been brought under GST, raising their retail price. The farmer continues to suffer,” he said. Bhupinder also attacked the state government for its “lack of vision, leading the state into chaos”. He said, “Congress had a vision for the state. Through our efforts, we were able to make Haryana the number one state in the country. This government has no understanding of governance and have led the state into disarray. The state is now number one in crime.” Recounting work done by his government, Bhupinder said 3.82 lakh poor families were given 100 sq yd plots, while the interest rate on farm loans was reduced to 0%. “BJP preaches “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”, but the attack on the minority family in Bhondsi reveals the real and scary face of its poor governance,” he said. Talking about the yatra, Hooda, the coordination committee chairman, said the six-day yatra the leadership has embarked upon, will seek support to end the people’s misery and to bring them relief. “Congress is the only party that can defeat BJP,” he reiterated.

So, today the real challenge is how do we create new jobs,"" he said. Pitroda said employment has been affected by factors such as demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). ""If you don't focus on employment there will be a major crisis,"" the technocrat-turned-politician warned. On whether the Congress has been able to take up the issue of employment in its campaign and narrative, Pitroda said: ""You will see it in the manifesto."" He expressed confidence that the Congress will finish the process of stitching up alliances in various states and its tie-ups will become clear soon. Asked if Congress president Rahul Gandhi was matching up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in terms of being the prime challenger, Pitroda said he doesn't see the contest as a challenge between two individuals. ""I think it is a challenge between the idea of India. It is about what kind of a nation you want to build going forward, what are the real challenges you have on employment, inclusion and all that,"" he said Pitroda also said it was a fight of ideologies and a fight between politics of hate and politics of love. He asserted that ""agrarian distress"" is also a major issue. ""I was told that there is problem of excess supply of onions and potatoes, and the prices are way down and that hurts farmers,"" he said. Pitroda, who is credited with being the architect of the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi, also alleged that science and technology, had been on the 'back burner in a big way"" under the Modi government. Asked how the Congress will bring the narrative back to real issues such as employment and alleged agrarian distress post the Balakot air strikes, he said the party will raise key issues on the ground among people.

 Rahul Gandhi mocks PM Modi's 'chowkidar' campaign | India News - Times of India,"PURNIA (BIHAR): Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday took potshots at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Main Bhi Chowkidar"" campaign, calling him a gatekeeper who stood guard for the wealth of the rich. Modi and his partymen have launched the 'Main Bhi Chowkidar' (I too am a watchman) campaign to blunt the Opposition's, especially the Congress's, 'chowkidar chor hai (watchman is a thief) slogan. ""What type of people employ chowkidars outside their homes? Have you seen a chowkidar deployed at the gates of a common man's house?"" Gandhi asked the gathering in Purnia. Addressing his maiden rally in Bihar upon the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls, Gandhi said Modi treated and addressed Anil Ambani, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi ""and others like them as bhai"" while ""he calls common people like you as only mitron (friends)"". ""He made promises of Rs 15 lakh into the accounts of all the poor, two crore jobs in five years and waiver of loans to the farmers. Did he ever tell you why he failed to deliver on these? Has he done anything for the benefit of farmers, workers and the youth?"" Gandhi asked. ""The Congress, on the other hand, promised loan waiver for farmers and did so within a fortnight of its governments being formed in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan,"" he claimed. He also said if the Congress-led alliance came to power in the state, ""it will draw a minimum income line and a sum of money will be automatically deposited into the accounts of those who were below this line"". Referring to demonetisation, the Congress president said if its stated purpose was eradication of black money, why were the common people made to undergo such great difficulties. ""Why the savings of women made over the years for difficult times were taken away from them in the name of demonetisation? If this government can waive loans worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore of the rich, why can he not provide much-needed relief to farmers?"" Gandhi asked.

 Congress wants Deve Gowda to contest from Bengaluru North: Dinesh Gundurao | India News - Times of India,"BENGALURU: Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President Dinesh Gundurao on Friday said his party wants JDS supremo H D Deve Gowda to contest elections from Bengaluru North constituency. ""I spoke to Deve Gowda ji and requested him to contest from Bengaluru North constituency... Congress has five and JDS two MLAs, who can ensure his victory,"" he told PTI. Gundurao said the former prime minister's representation from Bengaluru North will have a huge impact in the region, given his stature in public life. The 85-year-old JDS patriarch is yet to decide on contesting the Lok Sabha polls and has been thinking about his ""usefulness"" in the national capital. Gowda has said he lacked the strength that he had in 1996, when he became the Prime Minister, but there is ""enthusiasm"". Under a pact between ruling coalition partners for Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka, Congress has been allotted 20 seats while eight sets will be contested by Janata Dal-Secular (JDS). Asked if actor-turned-politician Sumalatha Ambareesh, wife of late actor and Congress leader Ambareesh, can pose a challenge to the coalition partners due to a possible sympathy wave, Gundurao said winning as an independent is difficult with JDS having a strong presence in state assembly, zilla panchayats and municipalities of Mandya district. Sumalatha is contesting as an Independent after she was denied ticket by the Congress from Mandya seat which had been allotted to the JD(S). Gundurao also said that the Congress would make extra effort to see that Nikhil Gowda, grandson of Deve Gowda, registers a win from Mandya constituency. Asked about the BJP's plan to make ""instability"" an electoral issue in Karnataka, Gundurao dismissed it as ridiculous saying PM Modi himself is leading a coalition government at the centre. Also, the BJP is in alliance with NDA partners in several states including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Punjab, he said. If Narendra Modi and BJP are against coalition, they should do away with it, he added. Gundurao said there have been some hiccups in the coalition setup, but the government has been stable. ""Congress-JDS alliance has given a stable government but unfortunately BJP has been making efforts to destabilise it by horse-trading,"" he alleged. Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the state Congress chief alleged that Modi ""is diverting people's attention from real issues like failure of GST, demonetisation and joblessness, to emotional issues like Ram Mandir and nationalism"". The dialogue of nationalism is very divisive and dangerous as it has already cut India into pieces on grounds of religion, ideologies and nationalism, he said. ""We are seeing people taking law onto their hands and killing people including rationalists M M Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh,"" he said. The Congress' efforts will be to expose Modi in all these fronts, he added. Asked if the BJP was in an advantageous position due to declaration of Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate, Gundurao said ""the appropriate question is who should not be the prime minister as there are a huge number of people who do not want Modi to continue"". ""It will not be easy for the BJP to sell the fake success stories perpetrated in media and social platforms to the people because the truth is that almost all the schemes including Ujwala has not done anything good to them,"" he claimed. On the other hand, the Congress had helped people by implementing MNREGA and bringing in legislations on food security and tribals right, besides Aadhaar, Gundurao added. Rejecting suggestions that his offer to Congress president Rahul Gandhi to contest from Karnataka is due to any fear of loss in Amethi seat, Gundurao said it was aimed at strengthening the party in the south. ""There is no design in this. I wrote a letter to Rahul Gandhi suggesting he contest from Karnataka as it would strengthen the party in southern states and retrieve the lost charm from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Let us see what decision the party takes,"" he said. Gundurao said Rahul Gandhi would address two rallies each in the two phases of Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka.

"Demonetisation and GST things of past for traders, but not forgotten | Nagpur News - Times of India","Nagpur: The anger against noteban and goods and services tax (GST) has died down and traders, who were vocal about being disillusioned with the BJP government, now have accepted the decisions. At the same time, the trading community, which had openly supported Narendra Modi wave in previous elections, now appears indifferent if not vehemently opposed to the BJP, say sources in the fraternity. The business class is predominantly known to be BJP voters. During the previous elections, traders were a major target group for the saffron party. Even the traders looked forward to the BJP for bringing pro-business policies. Moves like demonetisation followed by GST had left the section disappointed, which was reflected in the subsequent polls also. Sources in the local trading circles said, “The sentiment is lukewarm in the current elections. There are chances that the turnout from this section may go down, because unlike 2014, there is not much enthusiasm over supporting any particular party.” BC Bhartia, national president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said during the last elections there was a massive support to BJP by this segment. This time, you may not see the same enthusiasm of the previous Lok Sabha elections. Both note-ban and GST may be old issues now, but the traders have not forgotten the hardships faced due to it. This is being reflected in lukewarm sentiment among the trading community. Dipen Agrawal, president of Confederation of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT), said during 2014 general elections, there was an undercurrent against Congress among the traders and other business segments in general. This time, even if there may be a sentiment in favour of BJP, not much can be seen against the Congress. “Demonetisation and GST have certainly left the traders perturbed. A number of assurances made during the last elections have not been fulfilled by the BJP in its current term. For example allowing FDI in retail. All the issues have now been overtaken by the Balakot air strikes. Now, nationalism is the sentiment which is driving the voters’ choice,” said Agrawal. “Traders have adjusted to the GST and note-ban and have moved on, but the fervour is not the same as it was in the last elections,” said Kailash Jogani, president of Nagpur Chamber of Commerce Limited (NCCL).

" BJP trying to turn Lok Sabha polls into 'khaki election', says Shashi Tharoor | India News - Times of India","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Lok Sabha polls should be fought on ""perennial issues"" like poverty and disease and not on a ""tragedy of one moment"", says Congress leader Shashi Tharoor while accusing the BJP-led government of trying to turn the 2019 vote into a ""khaki election"" after the Pulwama attack. The momentum was with the Congress when the Pulwama tragedy struck on February 14, killing 40 CRPF soldiers, Tharoor said, hitting out at the government for trying to make the upcoming Lok Sabha polls a ""national security-based election"". ""We were doing very well by all estimations and the momentum was with us when the Pulwama tragedy struck us. Thereafter, the government has tried to make this a khaki election, a national security-based election,"" Tharoor told PTI in an interview. ""They are trying to hype their nationalist message that they were trying to protect the nation at the time of danger which, to my mind and my party's view, has not been the principle challenge facing the country,"" said the former diplomat and author who is aiming for a hat trick from the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat this time. In his view, a ""daily terror"" of hunger, poverty and disease strikes the hearts of millions of India and the government must deal with that too. ""I am not minimising national security, but I am saying that the election has to be fought on perennial issues and not on a tragedy of one moment. That tragedy will be dealt with, has been dealt with and should be dealt with."" ""But there is a daily tragedy, the daily terror of hunger, poverty, disease that is also a terror that strikes the hearts of millions of our fellow Indians and that too needs to be dealt with by the government,"" he said. Agreeing that some surveys have suggested the BJP's chances have improved after the terror strike, Tharoor said it was the job of his party to remind people of the real issues. According to the Thiruvananthapuram MP, there has been a dramatic change in the character of India under BJP rule. An estimated 97 per cent of all communal violent incidents relating to cow vigilantism have happened in last four years, Tharoor said. ""And those are figures issued by the home ministry of Rajnath Singh. Not by Congress, not by any NGO. These are government figures. These are very serious crises,"" he said. Lashing out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said ""triumphant majoritarianism celebrates violence"" and the ""prime minister stays silent"". ""So the condoning of this kind of thing is a deep assault on the very foundations of our democracy,"" the former Union minister said. He said there are attempts by the Centre to undermine the constitutional arrangement that India was a country for all religions. ""That's being undermined in the ruling party's language and rhetoric and is also undermined by steps like the Citizenship Amendment Bill which will allow every citizen of a neighbouring country except Muslims to settle here. That kind of bigotry was never part of Indian nationhood,"" he said. Tharoor also expressed the hope that the people of India will vote out the BJP as the party doesn't deserve a second chance. Addressing the issue of farmer distress, he said, ""Sadly, more farmers are committing suicide than there are victims of terrorism in India. I am not saying we should minimise ... we should also keep our country safe, but we want the people to address the existing real problems which includes major levels of agrarian distress. For the first time in history, we have eight farmer suicides in Kerala."" The former UN diplomat also mocked the claims of the BJP government over job creation and said the saffron party was only interested in keeping its own job in Delhi. The Congress wants every person in India to have a job, he said. Due to the failed employment policies of the BJP government, skill development has not taken off effectively in the last five ""wasted"" years, Tharoor said, alleging that the exports and manufacturing sectors had taken a beating. ""Thanks to demonetisation, not only the GDP growth got hit of 2 per cent, but small and micro enterprises have shut down across the country. Asked whether the Congress was ready to take on the BJP, he said it was ""absolutely"" ready. Common people, the Congress leader said, were suffering under NDA rule. An LPG cooking gas cylinder, which cost Rs 390 under the UPA regime, was priced Rs 975 under the BJP government for no good reason, he said.

‘Mistakes like demonetization wouldn’t occur if the response was anticipated’ | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Prof Kaushik Basu, professor of economics and Carl Marks Professor of International Studies at Cornell University, on Saturday called demonetization a policy mistake and said that it would not have happened if policymakers had anticipated the reaction of ordinary citizens and bureaucrats. Prof Basu was speaking at the 54th annual convocation of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A), where he was the chief guest. Prof Basu, former chief economic advisor to the government of India during the UPA government, and chief economist at the World Bank, was critical on the economic policies of the government. “Policy mistakes, such as demonetization, which hurt India’s growth, would not have occurred if there were policymakers who paid heed to this simple axiom: For every policy, you have to anticipate how ordinary individuals and bureaucrats will respond,” he said during his address. A total of 593 students, 398 in the MBA course, 45 in the MBA-FABM, 137 in the PGPX course and 13 of the Fellow Program in Management (the doctoral programme of the IIMs), were awarded their degrees on Saturday at Louis Kahn Plaza on IIM-A’s heritage campus, which was full of graduating students and their families. The degrees were conferred by Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the Aditya Birla Group and current chairman of the IIM-A’s board of governors. During his address, Birla gave the students leadership mantras, developing a courage quotient (CQ), obsessing over details, taking no shortcuts for success, retaining humility and never being deterred by failures. Prof Basu later said that the Indian economy is showing unmistakable signs of slowing down over last few years. “The latest data on industrial growth, pertaining to January 2019, shows that India’s industry is barely growing, with the growth rate down to 1.7%. In 2017-18, India’s exports were a little less than what the country exported in 2013-14, which means virtually 0% growth in exports on average for 4 years, which has rarely happened in the past,” said Prof Basu. He also said that India has been known globally for the quality and integrity of its statistical system. “We must take care not to damage this reputation,” said Prof Basu, referring to a recent letter signed by 108 leading economists. Illustrating the example of Argentina and the US, which were neck-and-neck economically at the beginning of 20th century, he said that the former fell prey to hypernationalism and xenophobia and failed to invest in higher education, research and openness to ideas.

Rahul Gandhi: You can't have negative atmosphere and expect economic growth | India News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: You cannot have a negative, fearful atmosphere in the country and expect economic growth, which is directly related to the mood of the nation, Congress president Rahul Gandhi said Tuesday.

Noting that it was ""our responsibility"" to stop the neighbouring country from carrying out terror strikes and save our people, Gandhi said, ""It is not good enough to say that 45 CRPF men died and now we will do something."" He sought to know why the attack (in Pulwama) was not stopped in the first place. Forty CRPF personnel were killed and five injured on February 14 in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir when a Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying explosives into their bus in Pulwama district. Claiming that the Congress pursued a policy of systematic and strategic approach in Jammu and Kashmir, he said the NDA government had not followed a similar policy. ""We actually crushed terrorism,"" he said and referred to the ""drastic fall"" in the number of soldiers and people killed during UPA's tenure. The Congress followed a multi-pronged approach when it came to power in 2004 and toed both systematic and strategic lines, he said. ""And it was successful,"" he said adding it led to diplomatic isolation of Pakistan. Gandhi also called his party's minimum income guarantee scheme a revolutionary idea.

RBI Board backed note ban in 'larger public interest': Official sources - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The government's proposal to ban Rs 500 and 1000 notes was placed by the then RBI deputy governor Rama Subramaniam Gandhi before its board, which resolved to back the move in ""larger public interest"" though some directors raised concerns about short-term negative impact on GDP and hardships to some sections, official sources said on Tuesday. The proposal, presented by R Gandhi to the Reserve Bank of India Board on November 8, 2016, said the move was necessitated due to a finance ministry letter received a day earlier advising the central bank that cash was facilitating ""black money"".

These observations also did not persuade any member come in the way of endorsing the proposal fully,"" a functionary said. One of the observations made was that arriving domestic long distance travellers who would be carrying high denomination currency will be taken by surprise. It would also have an adverse effect on tourists. Some directors felt that black money is held not in the form of cash but as gold or real estate, hence the move would not have a material impact on those assets.

"Demonetisation won’t curb black money, RBI told government - Times of India","MUMBAI: Some directors on the RBI board were not fully convinced with a majority of reasons cited by the government for demonetisation, but supported the move — which had been under discussion with the Centre for six months — in “larger public interest”, as it provided an opportunity to promote financial inclusion and digital payments. The government had said demonetisation would help curb black money and steep rise in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes; check the circulation of fake currency; and promote e-payments and financial inclusion. But according to minutes of the RBI board meet at 5.30pm on November 8, 2016, three hours before the PM announced demonetisation, “directors made the following significant observations”:  “Most of the black money is held not in cash but in the form of real sector assets such as gold or real estate and this move would not have a material impact on the assets.” livebudget updatesmoreupdatesSome RBI directors had countered the government’s argument on the growth in high denomination notes being much faster than the pace of economic expansion, arguing that “adjusted for inflation, the difference may not be so stark”.  “While any incidence of counterfeiting is a concern, Rs 400 crore as a percentage of the total quantum of currency in circulation is not very significant.”  On the plus side, it said, “Proposed step presents a big opportunity to take the process of financial inclusion and incentivising the use of electronic modes of payment forward...” RBI directors warned of short-term hit to GDPSome RBI directors had also cautioned against “short-term negative effect on the GDP” for 2016-17, although they termed it a “commendable measure”. Despite these reservations the board approved demonetisation, which was proposed by an RBI deputy governor and supported by a note from the finance ministry, which provided a draft scheme for withdrawal of existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes. The board was reassured by the fact that all the issues raised by the directors were under discussion between the central government and the RBI for six months. The Centre had also assured RBI that it would take measures to contain the use of cash and promote financial inclusion and electronic modes of payment. A few hours after the RBI board gave the go-ahead, PM Modi went on national TV to announce the withdrawal of the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The deliberations in the meeting on November 8 are a revelation as it shows that RBI did not see demonetisation as a solution to black money and counterfeit notes being used for terror financing and anti-national activity. The government had argued that during 2011-12 to 2015-16, the economy had expanded by 30%, while the pace of rise in Rs 500 notes was 76% and that of Rs 1000 notes was 109%. In counter, RBI said, “The growth rate of economy mentioned is the real rate, while growth in currency is nominal… Hence, the argument does not adequately support the recommendation.” It now appears that the government decision to allow medical stores to accept demonetised currency was at the behest of RBI. Those part of the board meeting included then governor Urjit Patel and his two deputies R Gandhi and SS Mundra. The other directors were Anjuly Chib Duggal, (then financial services secretary), Shaktikanta Das (then economic affairs secretary and independent directors Nachiket Mor, Bharat N Doshi, and Sudhir Mankad with RBI chief general manager SK Maheswari in attendance.

Income Tax: I-T to assess 80k big cash depositors during demonetisation | India Business News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Over 80,000 taxpayers who had deposited significant amounts of cash during the demonetisation period but failed to respond to initial notices sent by the income tax (I-T) department and furnish their tax returns for the financial year 2016-17 will now be subject to a ‘best judgement’ assessment. In a March 5 notification addressed to its senior cadre, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has laid down the standard operating procedure (SOP). Earlier, the I-T department had issued notices to around 3 lakh individuals under Section 142(1), requiring them to provide details relating to their cash deposits and also to furnish their I-T returns for 2016-17. In 87,000 cases, the I-T department received no response (or in technical terms, the notices were non-complied with). The CBDT has exhorted that the best judgement assessments should be completed by March 31, or latest by June 30. Nangia Advisors managing partner Rakesh Nangia explains, “These taxpayers are now on the wider radar of the I-T department as the tax officers have been authorised to gather maximum information about them and scrutinise the total income on the basis of such information. In other words, the I-T officer is authorised to assesses the total income of such taxpayers to the best of his judgement.” The CBDT notification explains that the I-T officer can send notices to any person under Section 133(6) for gathering material — such as additional information of the persons, details of the transactions and fund flow from banks — which would enable closure of the best judgment assessment. livebudget updatesmoreupdates“Such notices would be issued by the concerned I-T official after a careful appraisal of information at his disposal so that maximum possible additional information can be culled out. Further, a detailed analysis of past income tax returns, if available, should also be made to form an opinion regarding nature of transactions related to demonetisation,” the notification states. The SOP provides that an opportunity of being heard shall be granted to the taxpayer to explain his case. Further, the range head may examine the record of assessment proceedings and issue direction for guiding the I-T officers in conducting such proceedings. Sharing of information, such as details of beneficiaries that are now detected among relevant I-T officers, has also been called for. Nangia adds, “Though the CBDT directions say that a notice should be given to taxpayers, providing them an opportunity of being heard before completing the ‘best judgment assessment’, the law doesn’t require this since a notice under section 142(1) has already been issued in these cases.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."

Economy suffered due to demonetisation: Amartya Sen - Times of India,"New Delhi, Feb 27 () Nobel laureate and economist Amartya Sen Wednesday said the Indian economy suffered due to the government's decision to ban high-value currency notes in November 2016.  Speaking at a book release function here, Sen recalled that when he was in school in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, a visitor asked the students who are the greatest persons. There was a division of opinion between Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore.  ""But somebody said P C Sorcar (the famous magician)...I think demonetisation is straight out of the P C Sorcar takeaway.  ""The biggest magic was of course demonetisation and there are many others...So, I think the economy suffered a lot from the belief in magic,"" the renowned economist said.  On November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The two high-value currency notes together accounted for about 87 per cent of the currency in circulation at that time.  The decision led to a shortage of cash, and huge queues were witnessed outside banks for exchange and deposit of the banned currency notes.  However, in the following months, the economy was remonetised with the introduction of Rs 2,000 notes and new-look Rs 500 notes.

CIC pulls up RBI for non-disclosure of demonetisation records - Times of India,"New Delhi, Feb 18 () The Central Information Commission has pulled up the Reserve Bank of India for ""perfunctory handling"" of an RTI application seeking records of its board meetings where the issue of demonetisation was deliberated, and issued a show-cause notice to its Central Public Information Officer. Activist Venkatesh Nayak had sought records of all meetings of the RBI Central Board of Directors along with the papers, presentations or other documents placed before it, which led to the decision of demonetisation announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016.  Not getting any information from the RBI, which cited an exemption clause to deny the records, Nayak approached the commission, the highest adjudicating body in matters pertaining to the Right to Information (RTI) Act.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced on November 8, 2016 that Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes, which constituted about 86 per cent of total currency in circulation then, would cease to be legal tender.  They were replaced by new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes. Several restrictions were also placed on the withdrawal of currency notes from banks during demonetisation.  The petitioner told Information Commissioner Suresh Chandra that the information is not exempted under section 8 (1) (a) of the RTI Act as claimed by the CPIO.  The section exempts from disclosure the information which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence.  During the hearing, nearly 15 months after the RTI application was filed, the RBI's representative accepted that the information ""prima facie was wrongly denied"".  He further explained that considering the requests of the citizens after the instant RTI application was filed by the appellant and several rulings of the courts as well as this commission, they are ready and willing to provide the minutes of the meetings, Chandra noted.  ""The commission takes a serious view of the perfunctory handling of RTI application and absence of CPIO, during hearing and he is advised to attend the next date of hearing to explain as to why penalty should not be imposed on him,"" Chandra said.  He also said the CPIO should submit his written submissions and arguments before the next date of hearing.

" Jobless growth, rural indebtedness, urban chaos have made aspirational youths restless: Manmohan Singh | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The ""jobless growth"" has slipped into ""job-loss growth"", which, together with rural indebtedness and urban chaos, has made the growing number of aspirational youths restless, former prime minister Manmohan Singh said Sunday, as he hit out at the government for failing to uplift the economy to its potential. Singh asserted that the domestic challenges of India's economy were daunting in their complexity and devastating in their impact on the society. In his convocation address at the Delhi School of Management, he said the ""grave agrarian crisis, the declining employment opportunities, the pervasive environmental degradation, and above all the divisive forces at work"" were some of the challenges facing the nation. ""Suicides of farmers and frequent farmer agitations reflect the structural imbalances in our economy which call for serious in-depth analysis and political will to address them,"" the senior Congress leader asserted. ""The jobless growth slipping into job-loss growth, together with rural indebtedness and urban chaos have made the growing aspirational youths restless,"" he said. The attempts at creating additional job opportunities in the industrial sector have failed as industrial growth is not picking up fast enough, he alleged. In a scathing attack on the government, Singh said the small and unorganised sectors which were vibrant and contributing to generation of wealth and employment opportunities have grievously suffered in the wake of the ""disastrous"" demonetisation and ""slipshod"" introduction and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). ""Well thought-out policy and implementation strategies are required to stimulate industrial and commercial sectors. Knee-jerk reactions and off-the-cuff announcements of grandiose schemes and unproductive projects have manifestly failed to uplift the economy to its potential,"" he alleged. ?Singh said one of the areas of major concern in the endeavours to promote employment-oriented industry is the gap between the skills that the industry needs and the skill-sets that the graduating students possess. ""?We are living in a fast-changing world. On the one hand we are getting more and more integrated with the world economy and exposed to the global markets, and on the other hand we face massive economic and social challenges at home,"" said Singh, who was the prime minister from 2004-2014. Changing equations among global powers and fluctuations in the markets for petroleum products and other industrial commodities and the financial markets affect India's economy more than ever before, he argued. ""?Needless to stress, it is a testing time for our democratic spirit, our patience and tolerance, our capacity of managing contradictions, our resolve of ensuring inclusive growth - a strong, equitable and sustainable growth,"" he said. Addressing budding management professionals, Singh told them that they are joining the business world at an important time when India is projected to be one of the top three economies of the world by 2030. This possibility opens up many opportunities and challenges for budding management professionals in this fast moving world of unprecedented changes, he said.

"Currency surge due to small note need; circulation of Rs 2,000 notes inadequate: Study - Times of India","MUMBAI: The cash surge in the economy is due to the demand for lower denomination currency, and not necessarily because of a rise in unaccounted money, says a study. According to a report by SBI, the pace of circulating Rs 200 denomination notes, as well as other smaller units, increased manifold in FY18. The SBI report comes close on the heels of a similar study by HSBC, which said that the cash surge is a reflection of increasing ‘informality’ — a euphemism for unaccounted transactions or black money. HSBC had pegged the currency in circulation (CIC) at a new high of Rs 20.65 lakh crore on January 18 this year, way above the pre-demonetisation high of Rs 17.97 lakh crore. According to SBI group chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh, there is inadequate circulation of Rs 2,000 notes. The government too is believed to have halted the printing of Rs 2,000 notes. This may have altered the demand for smaller denomination notes in a big way to possibly counter the Rs 2,000 note paucity. “This means to sustain a transaction of the same amount now, the volume of currency notes goes up and — by default — the value of CIC also rises as smaller denomination notes are printed to at least ensure we are not reneging on economic activity,” said Ghosh. The SBI report put the size of CIC at Rs 20.4 lakh crore on January 18. It said that this is still far lower than what it would have been had there been no demonetisation. “Our estimates peg the expected amount of banknotes in circulation by March 2019 at Rs 22.45 lakh crore, if there was no demonetisation (11.9% of GDP). Based on trend estimates, notes in circulation could potentially reach around Rs 20.9 lakh crore by March 2019 (11.1% of GDP). Alternatively, this translates into at least Rs 1.5-lakh-crore lower CIC estimates compared to the trend,” the report said. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesThe report assumes that black money has increased is incorrect for two reasons. First, the income velocity (which is ratio of GDP divided by money supply), after showing a spike in the demonetisation period, has again gone back to its normal level of around 9.5 in FY18, and is estimated to come down further to 9 in FY19. “The decline in velocity means that increasing currency with public has failed to cause proportional increase in nominal GDP,” the report said. Second, leading indicators — such as sales of cars, commercial vehicles, two-wheelers and export-import trade — have seen a slowdown in past three-four months.

Cash in system surges: Informal sector's back? - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Currency in circulation touched a new high of Rs 20.65 lakh crore on January 18, 2019, way above the pre-demonetisation high of Rs 17.97 lakh crore. The increase in currency usage points to a recovery in 'informality' in the economy as the government goes easy on goods and services tax compliance and businesses continue using cash, according to Pranjul Bhandari, chief economist, India, HSBC. The acceleration of CIC since late-2017 has resulted in leakage of liquidity from the banking system, said Bhandari, who has previously served at the IMF, finance ministry and Planning Commission. The introduction of GST was expected to improve tax compliance but is taking time, she said in a research report. She said the informal sector, which had weakened significantly following demonetisation has, with the progress of remonetisation, inched up. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesHowever, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist, SBI group, told TOI, ""It is a matter of debate whether currency in circulation implies more cash usage. This is because there has been a decline in velocity of money implying that fewer cash transactions are being made."" In the past, economists have noted how CIC goes up ahead of major elections. Former governor Raghuram Rajan, too, had attributed the surge in currency in April 2016 to state elections. ""Around election time, cash with the public does normally increase.... You can guess as to reasons why, we can also guess,"" he had said. Bhandari says this is not the case now. ""We tested for some other drivers of cash as well, for instance, poll-related increase in cash use, and found it to be insignificant."" Bankers say money not coming back into the banking system is one of the reasons why they are unable to meet deposit growth targets Deposit growth during FY19 (up to January 18, 2019) at 4.9% has not been keeping pace with credit surge, which has grown 8.2% during the same period, making it difficult for banks to cut interest rates. ""Traditionally, currency in circulation has been positively correlated with rural demand. However, that relationship may have broken down in FY19. Nearly 70% of rural India, whose main source of income is wages, was not doing too well. And yet, CIC accelerated. We attribute this to the recovery in the informal sector,"" said Bhandari. When currency in circulation surpassed predemonetisation levels, government officials said the increase was below trend growth and as a ratio of GDP, it was still lower. The CIC-to-GDP ratio was 11.9% on the eve of demonetisation. After touching a low of 8.8% in March 2017, it jumped to 10.9% in March 2018, and a likely 11.4% by March 2019. ""We expect the CIC-to-GDP ratio to inch up further to 11.6% by March 2020, implying some increase but not an acceleration in currency leakage,"" said Bhandari. Incidentally, high CIC-to-GDP ratio was one of the reasons cited by the government for demonetisation. Bhandari attributes the rise of 'informal' economy to teething issues with the GST regime. She says this is expected to get addressed next year, arresting the increase in informality and blunting the acceleration in the CIC-to-GDP ratio. ""However, if rural demand rises over the year, that could lead to a rise in CIC,"" she adds.

"IL&amp;FS crisis an insolvency issue, says former RBI guv - Times of India","Satyanarayan.Iyer@timesgroup.com Pune: Former RBI governor Y V Reddy has said that the central bank should be worried about top institutions financing sectors of the economy without knowing what they are doing. Referring to the country’s top financial entities like the State Bank of India and Life Insurance Corporation holding stakes in the now troubled IL&FS, Reddy said that liquidity is not a concern but it is just a cause. He said that the IL&FS crisis is an insolvency issue more than it is a liquidity issue. In a wide-ranging address at Pune’s Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics that focused on the RBI’s independence and the government-central bank relationship, among others, Reddy said that recent trends pointed to an unprecedented situation. Referring to the October 2018 episode, with reports of government threatening to invoke Section 7 of the RBI act that deals with issuing of directions to the central bank, Reddy said that it pointed to a breakdown in communication between the two. livebudget updatesmoreupdates“The RBI’s reluctance to part with reserves was seen as a defiance of the government and not as a difference of opinion,” he said. He added, “Parting with reserves present and past is akin to extending perpetual loans (to the government) without interest.” Reddy said that critics also point out that the fiscal authorities are using the banking system to implement the government’s programmes on an unprecedented scale. “With the latest directions from the government on lending to SMEs, critics point out that behest lending of pre-reform period has been replaced with lending on command,” he said. Terming the current period in the central bank as one of confusion, Reddy said that it is important that this be resolved to enable the RBI to take on the many global challenges. He said that the central bank has done well whenever it has had the authority to think globally, act independently and apply its learnings in the domestic context. Saying that he was glad that the incumbent governor Shaktikanta Das said that he will uphold all that the RBI stands for, “it is also a matter of concern that he had to say it”. “The current crisis is not only a dispute of personalities but there is something more fundamental going on,” he said. He also said that the demonetisation episode affected the reputation of the RBI. “Demonetisation, announced by the Prime Minister in November 2016, came as a surprise. Reserve Bank of India seems to have reluctantly acquiesced after governor Raghuram Rajan had orally expressed reservations before he vacated the position at the end of his term. The decision was implemented during Dr Urjit Patel’s tenure. The RBI had to take the blame for the significant pain that was caused to the general public during the period of implementation,” he said.

"Will add 1 crore taxpayers next year; data, demonetisation helping widen base: Revenue secretary - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The government hopes to add another one crore income tax payers during the 2019-20 fiscal, building on the jump post demonetisation and better information flow due to steps initiated during the last few years, revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey told TOI. The income tax base has increased from 3.4 crore taxpayers in 2014-15 to around 7 crore so far in 2018-19. “Demonetisation has helped in getting more people into the formal economy and GST has added to formalisation and expanding the base. The tax base has increased as we are able to capture more transactions. Things like the 1% TCS (tax collected at source) on several property transactions is helping in better data,” Pandey said in an interview. Widening of the tax base has been a key focus of the government’s strategy over the last few years and it is one of the main reasons for the recent trend of rising revenues. During 2019-20, the government has budgeted for a 15% increase in direct tax collections, with personal income tax mop up projected to rise 17% on a strong base. Pandey said in the interim budget the government decided to take a “targeted approach” to tackle the challenges confronting the economy and the rebate on taxable income up to Rs 5 lakh was meant to help the new middle class. “As the income level increases and people have more scope to invest in saving instruments, they can pay tax. The rebate will help in bringing people in the tax net without imposing any burden,” he said. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesThe top bureaucrat, who is also the CEO of the UIDAI, said that Aadhaar had helped the government frame ambitious schemes. “It now is possible to identify the 12 crore small and marginal farmers or the 10 crore workers in the unorganised sector and launch schemes immediately, while ensuring that there is no leakage through bogus or ineligible beneficiaries,” he said, a day after the government announced the two social welfare schemes in the interim budget. The revenue secretary dismissed suggestions that the government had made unrealistic projections on revenue, arguing the GST collection target was in fact lowered in the revised estimate and only a modest increase budgeted for 2019-20. “GST is a new thing and we are in the process of stabilising it. There have been a lot of rationalisation and changes including adjustment to the threshold. We have not shied away from showing a lower estimate but next year’s projects are realistic,” he said.
