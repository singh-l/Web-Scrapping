" Surgical strikes sent Pakistan a message, says Army chief | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: There are enough viable and effective options to teach punitive lessons to Pakistan for aiding and abetting cross-border terrorism without crossing its nuclear red-lines, like it was done during the ""surgical strikes"" of September 2016 and the Balakot air strikes in February last year, Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Friday. The new Army chief told TOI that the strikes sent an unequivocal message to Pakistan, which may have re-activated the JeM terror facility at Balakot, that India ""can take down"" terror camps, infrastructure and launch pads across the border. ""The strikes definitely achieved a lot. It was a big message to Pakistan that it cannot operate with impunity,"" said General Naravane, adding Islamabad would be ""cautious before it thinks of doing anything escalatory"" in future. Pakistan, of course, often indulges in nuclear sabre-rattling, brandishing its 70-km range Nasr (Hatf-IX) nuclear missiles as an effective battlefield counter to India's ""Cold Start"" conventional war strategy. Pakistan PM Imran Khan, after the Modi government abrogated J&K's special status in August, even warned of a nuclear conflagration that would spill beyond the subcontinent if the international community did not pressure India on Kashmir. Brushing all this aside, General Naravane said, ""Historically, nuclear weapons have been a good deterrence, and that is where their role ends…We have carried out (cross-border) operations on two-three occasions without nuclear (weapons) coming into play."" Though General Naravane asserted violence levels have significantly reduced in J&K after the reading down of Article 370, and the law and order situation was ""set to further improve"", the Army's latest assessment is that there are 250-270 terrorists ""concentrated"" across the Line of Control (LoC) in areas south of the Pir Panjal mountain range, with another 160-190 to the north of it. ""There are many terrorists waiting across ready to infiltrate … they keep trying every day and we keep foiling them. There are certain foreign terrorists, even non-Pakistani ones, among them. We are keeping a close watch on the terror camp and launch pads across the LoC, though many are makeshift and keep changing their locations,"" said the Army chief. The defence establishment is much more positive about the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, especially after the first informal summit between PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jingping at Wuhan in April 2018 led to ""strategic guidance"" to the two militaries to manage and defuse troop face-offs during patrolling in accordance with existing protocols and mechanisms. But India must be ""firm in its resolve and be assertive about its claims, without being aggressive"", while working towards solving the vexed boundary issue with China. ""For several years now, we have been focusing on improving our infrastructure and capabilities along the `northern borders' with China. We must be prepared for all eventualities. If you want peace, you must be prepared (for war),"" said General Naravane. It's virtually ""impossible for the Army to guard every inch"" of the borders with China, which are longer with ""more inhospitable terrain"" than the borders with Pakistan. So, the aim is to ""be strong in important areas"" along the LAC, while mounting ""strong surveillance backed with quick-reaction capabilities"" in other parts. ""A strong infrastructure, surveillance and resolve is needed to guard the northern borders,"" he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"IAF lacked ODL during Balakot strike, fighter jets went incommunicado | Chandigarh News - Times of India","CHANDIGARH: Absence of operational data-link (ODL) was one of the biggest hurdles that the Indian Air Force (IAF) faced during the Pakistan Air Force retaliation on February 27, a day after the IAF carried out Balakot air strike deep inside Pakistan territory on Jaish-e-Mohammed terror training camp. Pakistan Air Force had better electronic warfare jammers, said Pravin Sawhney, former Army officer and an independent military analyst. “In so far as Wing Commander Abhinandan is concerned, he was captured by Pakistan primarily because he could not hear the instructions given by the ground controller for him to come back. Why? Because he did not have the software defined radio which obviate the noise clutter,” he added. Speaking at the Military Literature Festival on Saturday, Sawhney warned, “Electromagnetic spectrum has a very important role to play in war. The threat to India is not Pakistan, threat to India is interoperability.” Citing one more such example, Sawhney claimed that on February 27, IAF Sukhois took off but they did not know where to go and they actually came back. “As the Pakistan Air Force had better electronic warfare jammers, they were able to disturb the communication and Sukhoi-30 pilots were absolutely incommunicado,” he added. The former Army officer was one of the panellists at the session titled, “Understanding The Message of Balakot”. Former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa (retd) under whose leadership Balakot air strike was carried out was also one of the panellists in the discussion, besides former vice chief of IAF, Air Marshal K K Nowhar (retd) and Squadron Leader Sameer Joshi (retd). Sawhney said the IAF still does not have the data links which are absolutely critical and he had been hearing IAF talk about network centric operations since 2003. “The Pakistan Air Force had been using the ‘Link 70’ since last 15 years. They had been upgrading since 20/11 (Mumbai attack),” he added. India is patting its own back for the successful Balakot operations, said Sawhney, adding that he would refrain from taking sides and would be critical about IAF’s operational readiness as far as the network centric warfare is concerned. He emphasized that it was not important that you had 11,000 sorties. “What is important is your Mirage able to communicate in the air with your Sukhoi? Is the Sukhoi able to communicate with your ground,” he added. The incumbent IAF chief, Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria had himself admitted to a magazine that lack of operational data-link hampered the IAF response on February 27, said Sawhney. He said that his point was “if you do not win the war in the electromagnetic spectrum, you do not win the war at all.” This is why the US military had designated electromagnetic spectrum a war domain itself. Traditionally, India had been following the electronic warfare which is very complicated, whereas Pakistan has always maintained the balance both at the strategic and operational level, said Sawhney. ‘We are not PAF’ Air Marshal K K Nohwar (retd) said that the IAF has put in place the zest for making the operational database successful and operational. But everything takes time. He said the IAF was not the PAF where all the budgets are directed towards whoever can raise his hand high. “Suffice it to say that if the IAF was found wanting in electronic warfare system, in the response that was given by the IAF to defeat or to frustrate the PAF AMRAAM missiles would not have been possible if the electronic warfare system was not up to date,” he added. ‘Aim was not to kill all’ Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa (retd.) said that the operation was not to kill all and destroy all but was aimed at destroying terrorist training camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). “We had crossed the line of control after 47 years…Had they gone for war with us, they would have to literally eat the grass,” he added. The former IAF chief elaborated that pilots were systematically trained to carry out strike meticulously during early hours. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
" Pakistan trying to reactivate Balakot terror camp, govt says in Rajya Sabha | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday told the Rajya Sabha that attempts were afoot by Pakistan-based terror outfits to reactivate the Balakot facility that was hit in airstrikes carried out by Indian Air Force personnel in February this year. “Inputs indicate that attempts are being made by Pakistan-based terror outfits to reactivate its camp at Balakot and restart their religious and jihadi indoctrination courses against India,” minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy said in reply to a question. Asked what steps were proposed to be taken in the matter, Reddy said the government was committed to all necessary measures to protect the borders o the country and maintain its integrity and sovereignty. Recent reports, based on inputs received by the intelligence agencies, had suggested that Jaish-e-Mohammad had revived its facility in Balakot following the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, with a design to indoctrinate and train fighters to cause trouble in J&K. IAF jets had in cross-border airstrikes in February 2019, carried out days after the Jaish killed 40 CRPF personnel in a terror attack in Pulwama, destroyed a prime terror facility of the outfit deep inside Pakistan territory. The airstrikes caused the terror outfits to abandon their launchpads along the LoC/IB, though these too were revived some months later, particularly after the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K.

India won’t tolerate provocation from Pakistan: Rajnath Singh | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said the surgical strike across the Line of Control in 2016 and the Balakot air strike in 2019 show that India won't tolerate any provocation. India has never had any territorial ambitions, the minister said while addressing cadets after reviewing the passing out parade of the 137th course at the National Defence Academy (NDA) in Khadakwasla near Pune. Pakistan has realised that it will never win a conventional war against India and has since resorted to a proxy war. It will get nothing but defeat, Singh said. “Pakistan was defeated in 1948,1965, 1971 and 1999. This shows it will never win any conventional or limited war with India,” he said. India has always accorded importance to cordial and friendly relations with foreign countries, the minister added. The government was committed to the sovereignty of the nation and security of its people. “But if someone runs terror camps and attempts to attack our country, we will give them a stern reply,” he added. Singh said terrorism has become a global phenomenon. “We have witnessed 9/11 and 26/11. The Indian Army and security forces have fought against such attacks time and again,” he said. On the new challenges for the security agencies, the minister said, “ Cyberwar and tactics are being used to spread an ideology full of hatred. But our forces are equipped and trained to counter these challenges.” Emphasizing the contributions of the armed forces, Singh said, “The world has seen and experienced the professionalism of the Indian forces during humanitarian crises or in the event of a threat to global harmony.” Singh also reminded the cadets that it was their duty to safeguard the Constitution, the common thread that connected the military’s leadership to civilian leadership. The government has been focusing on defence development and diplomacy which has helped isolate Pakistan, he added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

 PM Modi changed political narrative: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: BJP chief Amit Shah on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi believed in delivering what was required for society without bothering about popularity ratings, adding that the Centre had taken several bold decisions which successive governments didn't dare to take for reasons like appeasement or vote bank politics. ""Modi has acted against three curses of Indian politics - appeasement, casteism and nepotism. This government works on efficiency and by keeping welfare of the people as the guiding principle, rather than vote bank politics. India has not seen a leader like Modi who takes strong decisions, in the interest of the nation and its people, without fearing backlash,"" Shah said. After releasing a book 'Karmayoddha Granth' on the life of Modi, Shah said the PM was the epitome of selfless service. He added that the government's decisions had shaped a strong image of India globally and Modi had revamped India's foreign policy and national security policy by de-linking the two. ""India emerged as a strong nation on the global stage while making its stance clear that India will not take attacks on itself lying down. India has emerged as a global power by taking bold decisions, including removal of Articles 370 and 35A in J&K, bringing Citizenship Amendment Act, resolution of Ram Mandir issue, criminalising triple talaq, conducting surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes, which nobody dared in the last 70 years,"" the BJP chief said. Shah said Modi had not only changed the political narrative by keeping the party manifesto at the centre of regovernance but had also taken tough decisions for people's welfare without caring about the consequences. ""The government is functioning on an ideology which keeps Deen Dayal Upadhyay's 'Antyodaya' at the centre,"" he added. Sharing his experience of working with Modi, Shah talked about the three phases of the PM's life, starting from dedicating his life to an ideology, entering politics on the ideals of the ""sangathan"", and finally upholding the tenets of parliamentary democracy and the Constitution to construct a welfare state. ""Modiji's childhood was devoid of luxury, full of poverty, disadvantages and neglect from society but he has dedicated his life towards the welfare of people, without having any ill-feeling for anyone in society,"" Shah said. He added that the Modi government had inherited a government plagued with corruption but had delivered a non-corruptible government since 2014, laying the foundation for a new India.

IAF strikes: Balakot air strike killed 130-170: Italian reporter | India News - Times of India,"Around 45 people are still undergoing medical treatment following the Indian Air Force strikes on the Jaish-e-Muhammed terror training camp in Pakistan's Balakot, while the bombings could have killed 130-170 JeM cadres, including 11 terror ""trainers"", according to Italian journalist Francesca Marino. Marino says in her report that despite Pakistan's efforts to deceive the world, details of what happened at Balakot in the early hours of February 26 have trickled in. She said that according to a source, a Pakistan Army unit from Shinkiari reached the location at 6am, two-and-a-half hours after the strikes. ""Shinkiari is around 20km from Balakot, and the (Pakistan) army unit would have taken around 35-40 minutes to reach the location from where the climb to the camp begins. Incidentally, Shinkiari is also a base of the Pakistan army, with the Junior Leaders Academy (JLA) located there,"" Italian journalist Francesca Marino said, writing for online magazine Stringer Asia. Marino claims that the injured were taken to a Harkat-ul-Mujahideen camp at Shinkiari and treated by Pakistan army doctors. JeM chief Masood Azhar on constant move since Balakot air strikes""Local sources say around 45 persons are still undergoing treatment in this camp, while around 20 have died during treatment due to serious injuries. Those who have recovered are still in custody of the army and have not been discharged."" She said that information from her contacts indicated the strike immediately killed a large number of Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) cadres. ""The numbers estimated have ranged from 130-170, including those who have died during treatment. Those killed included 11 trainers, ranging from bomb makers to those imparting weapons training."" While the casualty figure at Balakot has been subject to heated speculation, Pakistan army has so far refused access to the Jaish complex to any one. Some journalists have been taken to vicinity of the strikes but no one has been able to interview those who were at the camp or continue to be there. ""Two of the trainers were from Afghanistan. To prevent news on fatalities leaking through statements of family members of cadres, a group of JeM members also visited the families of those killed and handed over cash compensation to them,"" she wrote. Marino has written that adjacent to the Blue Pine Hotel, located at the foothill from where the trek to the JeM camp begins, is a painted signboard indicating presence of the Taleem-ul-Quran on the hilltop. ""Unlike the earlier board, all links to JeM leader and now internationally proscribed terrorist Masood Azhar has been removed. The camp area is still under the control of the army, with a Captain rank officer of the Mujahid battalion in command."" Access to the dust track to the camp is restricted, even to local police. Apart from a few children and 3-4 teachers, the complex has been cleared of any traces of it being a JeM camp. ""Meanwhile, inhabitants of Bisian township, near the JeM camp, still speak of some locals having noticed vehicles dumping rubble in the Kunhar river during the first night after the strike.""

 China-backed efforts to defuse Indo-Pak tensions post-Pulwama attack: Chinese foreign minister | India News - Times of India,"BEIJING: China had supported the efforts of India and Pakistan to defuse tensions and manage their differences through dialogue following the deadly Pulwama terror attack, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said, highlighting behind-the-scenes role played by Beijing. After the attack carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad in February that killed 40 CRPF personnel, India carried out air strikes against the biggest training camp of the terror group in Balakot in Pakistan. The air strike was followed by an aerial combat between air forces of the two countries on February 27 when Pakistan jets entered India. While chasing Pakistani jet an Indian Air Force jet crashed in Pakistan occupied Kashmir following which its injured pilot was captured. Pakistan quickly announced to release the Indian pilot, who was subsequently handed over to India. At the height of the Indo-Pak tensions, China sent its vice foreign minister Kong Xuanyou to Pakistan to counsel restraint from Islamabad. In an interview to the ruling Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, the People's Daily, about China's diplomatic achievements in 2019, Wang mentioned post-Pulwama tensions and Beijing's attempts to bring peace between India and Pakistan. ""During the India-Pakistan conflict, China supported the efforts of the two sides to defuse tensions and manage differences through dialogue,"" Wang said, without directly referring to the Pulwama attack and the aftermath. The transcript of his interview was circulated to media on Tuesday by the Chinese foreign ministry here. Also, Wang mentioned the 2nd informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in October at the top of highlights of the Chinese diplomacy in the neighbourhood, saying the meeting helped the two sides to charter the course for the steady growth of their ties. ""There are many highlights in China's neighbourhood diplomacy this year,"" he said. ""First, we have improved and developed relations with our neighbours in an all-round way. President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a successful second summit in Chennai and charted the course for the steady growth of China-India relations,"" he said. Earlier at a symposium on China's diplomacy in 2019 held here on December 13, Wang said the Chennai summit had set the tone for a steady and sound development of ties between India and China. Over the past year, China has comprehensively strengthened relations with neighbouring countries and made positive contributions, promoting regional stability and development, Wang said, while highlighting China's diplomatic outreach in the neighbourhood. President Xi and Prime Minister Modi held around five-and-half hours of one-on-one talks spread over two days as part of the second informal summit in Chennai. ""The two leaders had a long-term and in-depth strategic communication. They decided to deepen pragmatic cooperation in various fields, promote exchanges and mutual learning between civilisations, and maintain a stable Sino-Indian relationship,"" he said. The two leaders held the first informal summit at Wuhan last year followed up with the one at Chennai this year. They have agreed to hold their third meeting in China next year. At the Chennai summit the two leaders agreed to establish a high-level economic and trade dialogue mechanism with the objective of achieving enhanced trade and commercial relations, especially to address India's trade deficit with China which last year mounted to over US $57 billion in US $95.5 billion total trade between the two countries. They also decided to celebrate 2020 as 'Year of India-China Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges' and hold 70 activities to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of India-China relations. The Chennai summit ""set the tone for the steady and sound development of China-India relations and opened up new prospects for the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,"" Wang said in his address. In his interview to the People's Daily, Wang said China has improved its diplomatic outreach in the neighbourhood. ""On Afghanistan, as part of its shuttle diplomacy, China has facilitated the intra-Afghan dialogue and the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan and the China-Russia-US consultation, and hosted the first China-Russia-US-Pakistan four-party meeting,"" he said. ""China has served as a mediator between Myanmar and Bangladesh to encourage a negotiated solution to their outstanding issues,"" he said, referring to the differences between the two countries over the Rohingya refugees. Wang also spoke about improvement of relations between China and Japan, which in the recent past were affected by tensions over the disputed islands in the East China Sea. ""China and Japan reached a 10-point consensus on improving and growing bilateral ties, giving the relationship a strong momentum to return to the right track,"" he said. China-Asean (Association of SouthEast Asian Nations) also progressed over the disputed South China Sea. China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims. ""China-Asean relations have entered a new stage of all-round development, as evidenced by the important progress made in the consultation on a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and greater stability in the region,"" Wang said.

 Indian Army chief's remark of 'preemptively strike' right 'irresponsible': Pakistan | India News - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has rejected India's new Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane's statement that New Delhi reserves the right to ""preemptively strike"" across the Line of Control (LoC), terming his remarks as ""irresponsible"". In an exclusive interview to PTI barely hours after taking charge of the 1.3-million strong force, Army chief General Naravane on Tuesday said India reserves the right to ""preemptively strike"" at sources of terror. He asserted that a ""new normal"" in the country's response mechanism to acts of cross-border terrorism has already been ""emphatically"" displayed. ""If Pakistan does not stop its policy of state-sponsored terrorism, we reserve the right to preemptively strike at the sources of terror threat and this intent has adequately been demonstrated in our response during surgical strikes and Balakot operation,"" General Naravane said in New Delhi, in a stern warning to Islamabad. Reacting to General Naravane's remarks, the Pakistan Foreign Office in a statement on Wednesday said, ""We reject the new Indian Army chief's irresponsible statement regarding 'pre-emptive strikes' across the LoC"" inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). ""There should be no doubt about Pakistan's resolve and readiness to thwart against any aggressive Indian move"", inside its territory or PoK, it said. ""No one should forget Pakistan's befitting response to India's Balakot misadventure,"" it added. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. On February 26, Indian fighter jets entered deep inside Pakistan and bombed JeM terror camps in Balakot. The air strike was followed by an aerial combat between air forces of the two countries on February 27 when Pakistan jets entered India. While chasing Pakistani jet an Indian Air Force jet crashed in PoK following which its injured pilot was captured. The pilot was handed over to India on March 1. ""Despite India's provocations, Pakistan would continue contributing to all efforts of promoting peace, security and stability in the region and beyond,"" the statement said. The Foreign Office also said it will continue to highlight the issue of Kashmir on international forums. ""Pakistan reaffirmed its unflinching support and solidarity with the Kashmiri people as the inhuman lockdown"" in Jammu and Kashmir reaches 150 days, it said. The FO also said India must immediately lift the continuing communication restrictions in Kashmir. Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5 and bifurcating it into two union territories. Reacting sharply to India's decision, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled India's high commissioner. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda. Following the abrogation of Article 370, the Indian government imposed restrictions, including ban on mobile phones and Internet, in Jammu and Kashmir to maintain law and order. The restrictions are being gradually lifted in a phased manner. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Pakistan always underestimated our national leadership: IAF chief | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Pakistan always underestimated India's national leadership and they did the same during the Balakot air strikes, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa said here on Friday. The IAF chief, who retires later this month, was speaking at an event. ""You must remember that Pakistan has always underestimated our national leadership. Always. In the 1965 war, they underestimated Lal Bahadur Shastri. They never expected him to open up the front and go to Lahore,"" he said. ""And then they were surprised. They had thought that he will be only fighting in Kashmir... They were surprised. In the Kargil conflict, they were again surprised. They never expected us to pull all our forces and get our Bofors guns and get the Air Force into it and take them out,"" the IAF chief said. ""So they have always miscalculated. Even now, after Pulwama (terror attack) happened, I think they had miscalculated, thinking that our political leadership will not permit such a (Balakot-like) strike. It is not that our Air Force is not capable. They (Pakistan) know what our capability is. But they were always under the impression that our leadership will not (act),"" he said. In February this year, India carried out air strikes across the LoC and destroyed terror camps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province inside Pakistan. The strikes involving several fighter jets destroyed camps belonging to Pakistan-based terror outfits in Balakot. Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa, PVSM, AVSM, YSM, VM, ADC is the 25th IAF chief and assumed the post in December 2016 after Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha retired.

Balakot air strikes to come alive in central Kolkata pandal | Kolkata News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: A cross-border air strike by the Indian Air Force in February that went on to become the centre of a political discourse will be the theme of a Durga Puja pandal in the city. Young Boys Club Sarbojanin Durga Puja Committee, which turns 50 this year, is recreating the entire sequence of the Balakot air strikes, complete with models of a fighter plane and that of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman who went deep into the Pakistan territory. Scenes depicting the subsequent jubilation on Varthaman’s return that gripped the entire nation will also be put up. The Puja on Tara Chand Dutta Street in central Kolkata near Royal Indian restaurant is a big draw in the CR Avenue-Rabindra Sarani neighbourhood. “This is a landmark year not only for our Puja, which completes 50 years, but also for the entire country. We felt it was befitting to showcase the Balakot air strikes as our theme to pay homage to our soldiers who sacrifice their lives for the country,” said Rakesh Singh, chief organiser of the Puja. The Balakot air strikes followed an attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama on February 14, when 40 personnel were killed. “We are recreating the models outside and at the entrance of the pandal. There will also be a mock-up of Wing Commander Varthaman who became a national hero,” said Vikrant Singh, youth president of the club. Durga Puja pandals have evolved into platforms to showcase innovative ideas and unique art, displaying creativity. The themes more often than not present the socio-political atmosphere of a particular period and different ideologies. “We are depicting the event from the perspective of our armed force,” said Vikrant. Past themes for the Puja included Bengal’s folk culture, forts in Rajasthan and Buddhist pagodas. The club has hired artist Dev Shankar Mahesh from east Midnapore to create the Durga idol and the models for the theme. The height of the mandap would be 40 feet, one of the members said.

"Balakot strike satellite images: Radar, satellite images of IAF strikes in Balakot show 'significant damage': Sources | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force has given the government radar and satellite images showing bombing of the ""intended targets"" at the JeM terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot and ""causing significant damage"" to it, sources in the security establishment said on Wednesday. The source-based information about the ""evidence"" comes in the backdrop of a report by a foreign news agency claiming that satellite images of the Jaish-e-Muhammad camp in Balakot showed the facility is still intact and buildings are standing. The government was given on Sunday all the ""evidence"" of the February 26 strike on the JeM camp, including radar and satellite imagery, which showed that the S-2000 laser-guided munition hit the intended targets causing significant ""internal damage"", sources said. S-2000 smart bombs penetrates the targets and cause a blast inside, as per sources. They also said that the IAF has collected from independent sources satellite imagery of the site of the JeM camp after the strike to assess the impact of the operation, and these images have also been handed over to the government. The news agency report, which drew a comparison between an April 2018 image of the camp with that of an image taken on March 4, 2019, to show it is practically unchanged, also comes amid raging debate over the number of human casualties in the Balakot air strikes. Briefing reporters last week, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale had said ""a very large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis who were being trained for fidayeen action were eliminated"", while the government sources said 350 terrorists were killed. Later, BJP president Amit Shah put the toll at 250. Amidst foreign media reports suggesting minimal damage during these air strikes, opposition parties have been clamouring for clarity. On Monday, Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa said it is for the government to provide death toll of terrorists, and the IAF only sees if a target has been hit or not.

" Rafale to give India edge over China, Pakistan: IAF chief Bhadauria | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Rafale jets will greatly enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and will give it an edge over Pakistan and China, new IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Monday. ""Rafale is a very capable aircraft, once we induct it, it will be a gamechanger in terms of our operational capability and when we use it in combination with SU-30 and other fleets which we have, we would have a serious jump in our capability. It will give us an edge over Pakistan and China,"" Bhadauria told ANI soon after   taking over as the 26th chief   of the force. Incidentally, Bhadauria was the chairman of the Indian negotiation team for the Rs 60,000 crore 36 Rafale combat aircraft deal and played a significant role in getting deal cleared. The Rafale deal signed in 2016 is the biggest ever defence deal signed by India. IAF ‘technically accepts’ its 1st Rafale ‘RB-001’ from FranceThe first Rafale aircraft to be inducted by defence minister Rajnath Singh in France will also have the tail number RB-01 written on it in recognition of the role played by the officer in it.

 'Operation Bandar' was IAF's code name for Balakot strikes | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: When the Indian Air Force sent its package of 12 Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft to attack the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot on February 26, it code-named it 'Operation Bandar (Monkey)', to maintain secrecy. ""In order to maintain secrecy and ensure that the plans don't leak out, the Balakot operations were given the codename Operation Bandar,"" senior defence sources said. Without detailing any specific reason behind the name, sources said monkeys have always held a special place in India's war culture as seen in the epic Ramayana, where Lord Rama's lieutenant Lord Hanuman quietly sneaked into Lanka and destroyed the entire capital city of the demon Ravana. On February 26, 12 Mirages having taken off from multiple air bases crossed over into the Pakistani air space and carried out missile attacks on Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Balakot town of Khyber Pakhtunwa province. ‘263 terrorists at Balakot camp ahead of air strike’In the attacks carried out by the Indian Air Force, pilots had dropped five Spice 2000 bombs out of which four penetrated the rooftops of the building in which the terrorists were sleeping. The attacks were carried out at 3.30am and within a few minutes after dropping the bombs on their designated targets, the Indian Air Force planes returned to their bases. The aircraft used in the attack belonged to the No. 7 and No. 9 squadrons of the Indian Air Force and included the non-upgraded planes as the upgraded Mirages of the No. 1 squadron did not have the air to ground strike capability at that moment. Balakot air strike killed 130-170: Italian reporterWhile some of the Mirage aircraft carried out the attack on Jaish positions, a team of other few Mirages and Su-30MKI combat aircraft kept the Pakistan air force planes away from causing any hindrance or launching any counter-offensive. As per the Air Force briefings to the government, 80 per cent of the bombs had been dropped successfully on their targets and had carried out the requisite damage to the enemy locations. The operations were ably supported by the indigenous Airborne Early Warning and Control systems (AEW&C) plane Netra. The Indian Air Force had also kept its team of Garud commandos on stand-by for any kind of operations that may have been required due to any kind of emergency there. The Indian Air Force is also planning to reward the IAF pilots who took part in the attack with Vayu Sena Medal for Gallantry for their acts of bravery.

Pakistan lost millions in airspace closure post Balakot strike: Here's how countries earn from thin air - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: While the closure of   Pakistan airspace has hit Indian airlines hard   , having to re-route flights from India around the neighbouring country, thereby increasing the flying time and cost, it's impacted Pakistan as well, which has lost $100 million (around Rs 688 crore) since February with an average of 400 flights a day skipping the Pakistani airspace.   Pakistan closed its airspace   after the Indian Air Force's (IAF's) February 26 Balakot strike. Since then, it has only opened two of 11 air routes and both of them pass through southern Pakistan. ‘263 terrorists at Balakot camp ahead of air strike’On its part, the   IAF announced on May 31   that all temporary restrictions imposed on Indian airspace post the Balakot strike have been removed. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesSo how do countries earn money, quite literally, from thin air?An air toll: Airlines pay the civil aviation administration of the country they are flying over a certain fee based on the type of aircraft, the distance covered while overflying a country and the aircraft's all up weight (AUW) or gross weight, which is the weight of an aircraft before it takes off. In Pakistan's case, for a Boeing 737, the charges are $580 through its airspace — which will increase in case an Airbus 380 or Boeing 747 is flying over. Are all airspaces as pricey? No. Canada, for example, charges on the basis of the airplane weight and the distance travelled while its southern neighbour, the US, charges only for the distance. However, the US can afford to be that generous considering its airspace isn’t just restricted to its landmass but extends all the way up to the Philippines — which means that a flight from Japan to New Zealand, which comes nowhere near the continental United States, will still end up paying @$26.51 per 100 nautical miles (roughly 185.2km) to the US FAA. How expensive is India? The DGCA sets the overflight and landing charges in India, with domestic flights required pay less than international flights. The charges are calculated by multiplying the distance in nautical miles and the weight with a fixed charge component for airspace fees of Rs 5,330 if the fight lands in India. For those flights which are overflying, the charges are calculated on the basis of the route or the airspace fees, the distance and the weight, with an additional amount of Rs 5,080. Due to closure of airspace by Pakistan, national carrier   Air India lost Rs 491 crore till July 2   , according to data presented by civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri in Rajya Sabha. Private airlines SpiceJet, IndiGo and GoAir lost Rs 30.73 crore, Rs 25.1 crore and Rs 2.1 crore, respectively, the data stated. Why do charges vary? Since 1944, when the US organised an international civil aviation convention in Chicago to try and hammer out an agreement between various countries to remove airspace restrictions for commercial flights — which failed, by the way — all the countries have charged according to their own whims and fancies for 'renting' out their airspace. In fact, air travel has become cheaper since 1990 with the opening up of Chinese and Russian airspaces which were till then off limits to airlines from non-Communist countries, such as the US and western Europe. Is it about the money? While money is certainly a consideration in allowing overflight rights — the US, in 2016, by a conservative estimate that assumes just 100 nautical miles of overflying by the various airlines, earned close to $200 million from its airspace while a cash-strapped country such as Pakistan could do a lot with $100 million — there's also politics involved. Flights to and from Israel are not allowed the usage of airspace by the Arab countries while Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and UAE have banned overflights by aircraft registered in Qatar due to its alleged support to terrorism. Other countries that have used their airspace as a political tool include China, which denies overflight rights to airlines from Taiwan.

With the opposition parties demanding clarity,   Union minister Prakash Javadekar   criticised them for questioning the Indian Air Force's bombing of a terror training camp in Pakistan, saying operational details cannot be shared as doing so will only help the neighbouring country. ""The whole country is proud of our armed forces ... the Air Force. When they have conducted air strikes deep inside Pakistan, raising doubt and asking for proof is actually helping Pakistan.

"Pakistan F 16 Jet: After ATC mix up, Pakistan F-16 jets intercepted Delhi-Kabul Spicejet flight last month | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Amid tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad after Balakot air strikes in February, Pakistani fighter jets intercepted a Kabul-bound Indian passenger plane for almost an hour over their airspace last month. The SpiceJet flight was mid-air when two Pakistani F-16 jets flanked the commercial plane and asked its pilot to lower its altitude and report to them with the flight details. The incident occurred on September 23 and the flight involved in the incident was SG-21, which had taken off from Delhi for Kabul. Around 120 passengers were on board. More importantly, the incident was reported when Pakistan airspace was not closed for India. The SpiceJet captain briefed Pakistani F-16 jet pilots, saying, ""This is SpiceJet, Indian commercial aircraft, which carries passengers and is going to Kabul as per schedule,"" sources told ANI. When the F-16s rounded up SpiceJet, the Pakistani jets and their pilots could be seen by passengers. One of the passengers on the flight, on the conditions of anonymity, told ANI that the Pakistani fighter pilot instructed SpiceJet pilot through hand signs to lower the altitude of the commercial plane. According to sources, every flight has its code, like SpiceJet is known as 'SG'. It caused confusion and Pakistani ATC misunderstood SpiceJet as 'IA' and misinterpreted it as the Indian Army or India Airforce. When Pakistani ATC reported about an aircraft coming from India with IA code they immediately launched their F-16s to intercept the Indian plane. After the confusion was sorted out, the Pakistani fighters escorted the SpiceJet out of Pakistan airspace till they entered Afghanistan, confirmed a DGCA official. ""At the time when Pakistani F-16s were flying around their flight, all passengers were asked to shut their windows and maintain silence,"" the passengers told ANI.

BJP and PM Narendra Modi politicising Balakot air strike: Prithviraj Chavan | Pune News - Times of India,"PUNE: Former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Monday came down heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for politicising the IAF’s air strike on Balakot in Pakistan. The international media has raised questions on the Union government’s claims of air strike and its consequences, Chavan said, while addressing a news conference in the city. “The government should now take the lead and explain to the citizens what really happened. The way PM Modi and other BJP leaders are handling the matter, it is very demoralising for the armed forces,” he said. Taking a dig at the Congress, PM Modi had said on Saturday that Rafale fighters could have delivered even better results (in Balakot air strike). Reacting sharply to it, Chavan said such comments underestimated the capacity of Indian armed forces and air force officers, who had shown great valour while carrying out the air strike using old MIG aircrafts. “Modi, who is blaming the Congress for the delay in procuring the (Rafale) jets, should tell the citizens of the country as to why the Union government could not get even one aircraft during the last four years. The Congress had carried out a number of processes to procure the jets. Even trials were carried out and prices were also fixed. The BJP government should have bought them, but they sat quietly on them and are now trying to get political mileage out of the issue,” Chavan said, adding, “Such remarks are not sending a right message to the world. The international media has already raised doubts over India’s action,” Chavan said. Suspense over Pune LS seat candidate When asked if the party was considering to field an outsider as its candidate from the Pune seat during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said, “The decision of selecting the candidate for the city has not been taken yet.” He said a meeting regarding this was held, in which 21 party leaders were in attendance. “We have given a report about it to the party higher command, who will take a call on who to nominate,” Chavan said.

 Balakot strike will compel Pakistan to change its behaviour: Navy chief | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Even as India keeps a hawk-eyed scrutiny on China's expanding footprint in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), the country's top military officer says the February 26 air strikes on the Jaish-e-Muhammed facility at Balakot constituted a paradigm shift that will compel Pakistan to change its behaviour on fueling cross-border terrorism. ""India's pro-active action (the air strikes) has changed the discourse and dialogue viz-a-viz Pakistan. A new norm (retaliation to a terror attack) has been established. I am quite sure it will lead to behavioural changes in our adversary,"" said Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba, who is also the chairman of the chiefs of staff committee, on Monday. With the pre-dawn air strikes sending an unequivocal warning to Pakistan that India was willing to breach its self-imposed red-lines despite the risk of escalation, the Navy also ""forward deployed"" its warships and submarines in the north Arabian Sea to deter and defeat any ""misadventure"" by Pakistan at that time. ""It successfully worked,"" said Admiral Lanba, in an interview to TOI. An expansionist China, backed by its rapidly rising military and economic muscle, of course, presents a much bigger challenge for India. After establishing its first overseas base at Djibouti in the Horn of Africa and naval turnaround facilities at Karachi, China now has six to eight warships deployed in the IOR at any given time. The Indian Navy, however, is quite confident of its dominance in its strategic backyard for now. ""The Chinese Navy is here to stay. But they face the tyranny of logistics in the IOR. We have adequate force-levels at present to look after our maritime interests,"" said the Navy chief. But Admiral Lanba acknowledged that China is ""investing heavily"" in building a ""blue-water Navy"", having commissioned 80 warships and submarines at a stunning pace in the last five years, which could upset the balance of power in the future. With an aircraft carrier (two more are being built), 33 destroyers, 54 frigates, 42 corvettes, 50 diesel-electric and 10 nuclear submarines, among other warships, China is now posing a stiff challenge to even the high-tech US Navy. The Indian Navy, which currently has 140 warships and 220 aircraft, also has 49 warships under construction in domestic shipyards and two frigates in Russia. ""We are not trying to match China. But naturally, we would also like to commission more ships every year,"" he said. The Navy, despite budgetary constraints, hopes to become a 212-warship and 458-aircraft force by around 2030. This will include 18 diesel-electric submarines, six SSNs (nuclear-powered attack subs) and four SSBNs (nuclear-powered subs with nuclear ballistic missiles). India, of course, is also stitching up military logistics pacts to expand its strategic reach on the high seas. If the one with the US now allows Indian warships refueling facilities as well as access to American bases in Djibouti, Diego Garcia, Guam and Subic Bay, the one with France will extend ""our reach in south-western IOR"" due to French bases in the Reunion Islands and Djibouti. ""The MoU for the logistics pact with Russia has also been inked,"" said Admiral Lanba. The Navy chief also said military force-levels and infrastructure in the country's only theatre command in the strategically-located Andaman and Nicobar archipelago were being steadily upgraded. With an eye firmly on China, the government has virtually finalized a 10-year Rs 5,650 crore military infrastructure development plan for the ANC, which will allow stationing of additional warships, aircraft, drones, missile batteries and infantry soldiers there, as was first reported by TOI.

Bhadauria, who has around 4,250 hours of flying experience on 26 types of aircraft and led commercial negotiations for procurement of the 36 Rafale jets, also said the induction of these French combat aircraft will give the IAF enhanced aerial prowess over the country's ""adversaries"". ""We are monitoring the developments and I reassure the country that we are ready to deal with any situation where our services are required by the nation,"" the Air Chief Marshal told PTI. ""We are prepared for any eventuality and will carry out any mission as directed by the government,"" the 60-year-old air chief said when asked whether IAF was prepared to carry out another strike across the border in view of Army Chief Bipin Rawat's recent comments that the Balakot terror camp has been reactivated. The IAF had carried out a precision strike, bombing a major Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan's Balakot on February 26, which was seen as a paradigm shift in India's approach in containing cross border terrorism. The IAF Chief also asserted that his force was ready for a similar mission. Without elaborating, Bhadauria said the IAF was in the process of inducting significant combat capability which will bolster its overall operational potential. ""We are always vigilant and are fully prepared to deal with any contingency,"" he said. On the procurement of 36 Rafale aircraft, he said,""Rafale aircraft will give us enhanced capabilities over our adversaries. It will significantly boost combat prowess of the IAF."" The first of the 36 Rafale jets will be received by defence minister Rajnath Singh at a ceremony in Paris on October 8. Noting that modernisation of the IAF is one of his key priorities, he said, ""modernisation of the IAF is a continuous process. Significant steps have been taken to expedite the process. We need indigenous design and development to play a very significant role."" He also added that the IAF ""is in the process of inducting significant combat capability which will bolster our overall operational potential."" With the force grappling with rising number of accidents involving its aircraft, the IAF chief said ensuring safety of aircraft and other war fighting equipment will be another focus area for him. Earlier, in a brief message to the IAF personnel, he said, ""the focus of the IAF shall be to rapidly operationalise newly inducted platforms and equipment as well as to ensure earliest and complete integration of these capabilities in IAF's operational plans."" After taking charge as 26th IAF chief, Bhadauria also called on the Defence Minister. ""There shall be impetus on modernisation through acquisition of crucial technologies and critical capabilities with increased reliance on indigenous design and development. We shall pro-actively promote indigenisation for sustenance of all existing fleets and equipment,"" the IAF chief added. He was commissioned in to the fighter stream of the Indian Air Force in June 1980, and has held various command, staff and instructional positions An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Bhadauria was commissioned into the fighter stream of the IAF in June 1980 and won the coveted 'Sword of Honour' for standing first in the overall order of merit. During his nearly four-decade-long career, Bhadauria commanded a Jaguar squadron and a premier air force station. He devised a method for carrying bombing from the Jaguar aircraft using the Global Positioning System (GPS).

Her son expanded the slogan and the country's poverty,"" Modi said. ""His widow then ran the country using a remote control for 10 years and she also expanded poverty. Now her shehzada is doing the same,"" the PM said in a reference to former PMs Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, as well as former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul. ""For me, chowkidar is representative of Mahatma Gandhi's concept of trusteeship,"" he said, adding that the ""country does not need rajas and maharajas, but it makes me happy that the spirit behind chowkidar is expanding"".

"IAF Surgical strike: US throws weight behind India, asks Pakistan to avoid military action, root out terror camps | India News - Times of India","WASHINGTON: In a statement that left no doubt where its support lies, the Trump administration on Tuesday described India’s airstrike on the Balakot terrorist training facility as “counter-terrorism actions,” emphazised Washington’s close security partnership with India and the shared goal of maintaining peace and security in the region, and told Pakistan to de-escalate current tensions by avoiding military action and take meaningful action against terrorist groups operating on its soil. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who is in Hanoi with President Trump for talks with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong UN, spoke to India’s external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and her Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi underscore these points. “I expressed to both Ministers that we encourage India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, and avoid escalation at any cost. I also encouraged both Ministers to prioritize direct communication and avoid further military activity,” Pompeo said. The full text of the statement: Concern Regarding India-Pakistan TensionsFollowing Indian counter-terrorism actions on February 26, I spoke with Indian Minister of External Affairs Swaraj to emphasize our close security partnership and shared goal of maintaining peace and security in the region. I also spoke to Pakistani Foreign Minister Qureshi to underscore the priority of de-escalating current tensions by avoiding military action, and the urgency of Pakistan taking meaningful action against terrorist groups operating on its soil. I expressed to both Ministers that we encourage India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, and avoid escalation at any cost. I also encouraged both Ministers to prioritize direct communication and avoid further military activity.The US statement, by its very wording, tone, and sequence, acknowledged India’s right to conduct the punitive strikes against terrorist camps that were first recorded by US’ own intelligence in 2004. Although the statement eventually encouraged both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, it put the onus on Islamabad to do so by abjuring military response against India and instead directing meaningful action against terrorist groups.

Neither man mentioned the cause of the tensions: Pakistan’s unceasing hosting and use against India of terrorist groups that have been identified worldwide and proscribed by the United Nations. Pakistan continues to coddle the Jaish-e-Mohammed despite the group taking credit and boasting about the Pulwama suicide bombing that killed more than 40 Indian paramilitary forces. In fact, Pakistani extremists and trolls celebrated the deaths on social media. Throughout last week, the Trump administration indicated it supported India’s right to self-defense against such Pakistani terrorist depredations, exercising far less restraint than previous US administrations headed by Presidents Obama and Bush. Indeed, world opinion, except for a few members of the Jammu and Kashmir contact group at the OIC, has solidly lined up behind New Delhi, the outcome of long years of restraint against Pakistan’s use of terrorism.

Airspace should not be closed at whims &amp; fancies of Pakistan: SpiceJet chief Ajay Singh - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: An Indian carrier has officially raised the issue of Pakistan shutting its airspace for over four months for overflying earlier this year and constantly doling out that threat every now and then, at a United Nations forum. SpiceJet CMD Ajay Singh raised the issue of the neighbour’s “whims and fancies” while speaking at UN’s SDG Climate Summit in New York on Sunday. Pakistan had closed its airspace for overflying of all flights on February 27 following Indian Air Force’s Balakot strike, forcing all flights between parts of south Asia with Delhi at its heart and the west taking a longer route. It had re-opened the same after 138 days on July 16. “A disturbing phenomenon of late has been the decision of a member state, Pakistan, to deny overflying rights over its airspace. We must make sure that such decisions are not dependent on the whims and fancies of any member. Closing airspace results in airlines not only burning more fuel but also results in higher carbon emissions. Several Central Asian airlines as well as those providing connectivity to Europe and the United States from Southeast Asia were forced to cancel their flights to India due to the ban by our neighbour recently,” Singh said. SpiceJet, which was the first Indian carrier to operate a trial flight using bio fuel-blended ATF, plans to have all electric ground vehicles at airports. “So while we flew just 1 flight out of the 1,50,000 flown on biofuels so far, we have committed that by 2030, India will fly a hundred million of its passengers, the same number of total passengers that we flew in 2015, using safe aviation fuels,” Singh said. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesHe added: “While aviation contributes only a minuscule percentage of greenhouse gasses, it remains a strong and visible symbol of our times…. quickly adopting new aircraft technology that burns 20% less fuel for every flight flown. We do this every day by advising our pilots the optimum heights at which to fly, the optimum speed at which to fly and remind them to use only a single engine while taxing at airports. We do this by ensuring that all ground vehicles will be electric.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest Business News."

 Could have inflicted heavy damage on Pak during Feb 27 dogfight if possessed 'tech asymmetry': IAF | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: If the Indian Air Force (IAF) possessed high levels of ""technological asymmetry"", then it would have been able to inflict heavy damage on Pakistan during the adversary's unsuccessful aerial raid on February 27, according to an IAF report. The report analysed various aspects of IAF's air strike on a Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26 and the subsequent Pakistani retaliation the next day. India carried out the air strike to avenge the Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. In the report, the IAF said Pakistan Air Force has been consistently enhancing its air defence and offensive capabilities since the Kargil war in 1999 and there was a need for India to bolster its ""technological asymmetry"" for aerial combat, official sources said sharing details from the report. At present, Pakistan has some edge with its fleet of F-16 jets with AMRAAM missile fitted with them, said an official. The sources said the planned induction of Rafale aircraft with deadly Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) and S-400 air defence missile system will provide India a significant advantage over Pakistani Air Force. ""We felt we could not punish the adversaries appropriately. So we need to bolster technological asymmetry so that the enemy does not even dare to come close to the border,"" said a source. On the Balakot strikes, the report said the Israeli Spice 2000 precision guided munitions (PGM) fired from Mirage 2000 jets hit five out of the six designated targets in the JeM training facility. However, one Spice PGM did not leave the aircraft because of a drift in the inertial navigation system. The report said the deception used was successful as Pakistan was caught off guard despite their air force being put on highest alert. Various packages of jets flew in several directions including a fleet of Jaguars went towards Bahawalpur, a key air base of Pakistan Air Force, sources said. In the list of possitives from the strike, the IAF talked about accuracy of intelligence inputs, precise selection of targets, demonstration of its ability to carry out precision strikes and its success in maintaining secrecy of the operation though over 6,000 personnel were involved in it. In its analysis of possible areas for improvement, the IAF sought superior technological asymmetry and air defence system over Pakistan, sources said. It also talked about the need for procuring new weapons and other platforms for enhancing the IAF's overall combat capabilities. Sources said the IAF has began working on all the negative aspects mentioned in the report. Induction of Rafale jets along with Meteor beyond-visual-range missile and S-400 air defence missile system will provide India an edge over Pakistan, according to the report. India is procuring a batch of S-400 air defence system from Russia at a cost of USD 5 billion. India is also buying 36 Rafale fighter jets from France at a cost of Rs 58,000 crore. During the aerial combat of February 27, IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman had engaged with one of the Pakistani F-16s and shot it down before his Mig-21 Bison was downed. Varthaman was captured by Pakistan and was released after spending nearly 60 hours in Pakistani custody. The Indian Air Force had on February 28 displayed pieces of an AMRAAM missile, fired by a Pakistani F-16, as evidence to prove that Pakistan deployed the US-manufactured fighter jets during the raid. Pakistan has been claiming that it had not lost any F-16 during the February 27 dogfight. Rejecting Pakistan's claims, the IAF on April 8 released radar images as part of its ""irrefutable evidence"" to assert that it shot down an F-16 fighter jet of Pakistan during the aerial combat over Nowshera in Jammu and Kashmir.

"IAF strikes Pakistan: Tank up, govt told airfields 6 days before Balakot strike | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: State-run oil companies were asked to top up jet fuel at northern airfields and storage depots six days before the air strike on a terror camp inside Pakistan on Tuesday, while a chain of 500 tankers are on way to the Kashmir region carrying replenishments, including motor fuels and kerosene. “As we speak, some 30 tankers have crossed the Banihal tunnel on way to the Valley as the Jammu-Srinagar road reopened today after being blocked by an avalanche for days. All civil and military airports in the northern and western regions overlooking the Pakistan border have full stock of ATF (aviation turbine fuel),” a top government official told TOI on Wednesday. Ample fuel stock and uninterrupted supply chain hold key to the effective speed and staying power of a military machine. Fuel supply to the northern region has always been strategically important since it is home to some of the most hostile geographies in the country and shares two borders — Pakistan and China. The current tension between India and Pakistan has added a sense of urgency to the issue. That is why, the official said, the oil companies have maintained fuel storage levels for the forces, though civil supplies have faced rationing due to periodic disruptions in the supply chain from Jammu and panic-buying. Avalanches triggered by heavy snowfall and landslides have periodically disrupted traffic on the Jammu-Srinagar highway. This is Kashmir’s sole road link to the rest of the country as the other link through Himachal and Leh-Kargil remains buried under 25-30 feet of snow at this time of the year. The Ladkah region too remains cut off but has the requisite ATF and motor fuel stockpile built up in summer when road links through Kargil and Srinagar as well as Himachal Pradesh open up. “There is enough fuel stock in storage facilities of Ladakh. Barrels can also be airlifted quickly,” the official said. India’s largest oil refiner and fuel retailer IndianOil has storage facilities at Kargil, Leh and Nyoma in Ladakh.

 Balakot message was to tell Pak there will be cost for terror attacks: Former Air Chief Marshal | India News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: The message of the Balakot air strike was to tell the Pakistani establishment and terrorist organisations that there will be a cost to pay for terror attacks in India which was effectively conveyed, said former Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa. He was speaking during a discussion on 'Understanding The Message of Balakot' on the second day of the Military Literature Festival organised here by the Punjab government and the Chandigarh administration. ""The message of Balakot, therefore, was to tell Pakistani establishments and terror organisations that there will be a cost to pay for terror attacks in India which was effectively conveyed,"" said Dhanoa. However, he said, ""on our side.. (there were) stupid mistakes for which remedial measures have been taken and people responsible will be punished."" Dhanoa did not share any details about what the ""stupid mistakes"" were. He also said, ""We could not impose significant costs on PAF (Pakistan Air Force) on 27 of February (when the Pakistan Air Force retaliated a day after the Balakot strike)."" Dhanoa asserted that there was a paradigm shift in the way the Indian government responds to terrorist attacks involving mass casualties. He pointed out that there was no military response from the Indian state after the 1993 bomb blast in Mumbai and the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. ""The first response came after terror attack at Uri in 2016 and it was retaliated by the Army with an attack on destroying terror launch pads inside Pakistan Occupied Kashmir,"" said Dhanoa, who retired from service on September 30. Pakistan got the message that the new government will respond militarily to a major terror attack on its soil, he further said. Dhanoa said that after the Pulwama attack in February in which 40 people were killed, the Pakistani establishment had feared that there would be retaliation. ""There were only two questions -- when and where the retaliation will take place,"" he said. A decision was taken to strike a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot area as the terror organisation was behind the Pulwama attack. ""The government and political will was very clear to tell the Jaish-e-Mohammad and Pakistani establishment that such attacks would come at a cost and no matter where you are, be it PoK or Pakistan, we will get you and that is the message of Balakot,"" Dhanoa said. Pointing towards the poor fiscal health of Pakistan, Dhanoa said that in February 2019, the neighbouring country was reeling under severe financial crisis. ""Their foreign reserves were $50 billion compared to USD 400 billion in our case. Had they gone to war with us, they would have literally eaten the grass,"" he said. The former IAF chief also said that the biggest lesson one could learn from the limited period engagement was that technology matters. ""What about the responsibility of people who were to get this technology and kept negotiating for nearly 10 years to get the MMRCA (Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft)? What would have happened in the same engagement had Wing Commander Abhinandan (Varthaman) been flying Rafale aircraft instead of MiG 21- bison?"" he asked. The Indian Air Force had struck a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot area on February 26 in response to the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in J&K in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.

IAF strikes latest news: NTRO surveillance of JeM camp in Balakot before strikes confirmed 300 active targets | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Before Indian   Air Force jets struck the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) terror camp   in Balakot on February 26, technical surveillance by Indian intelligence agencies had found 300 mobile phones active at the facility, giving a clear indication of the total number of inmates housed there, sources said on Monday. The National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) had started surveillance of the facility after the Indian Air Force (IAF) was given clearance to target the camp in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the sources said. On February 26, 12   Mirage 2000 IAF jets   penetrated deep inside the Pakistani air space and launched 1,000 kg Spice 2000 bombs at the camp in Balakot, which housed terrorists, including commanders and an ammunition dump. Military has proof of hit on Balakot Jaish camp; up to govt to release it“During technical surveillance, it emerged that there was presence of around 300 mobile phones with active signal strength inside the facility in the days leading up to the strike. The facility was destroyed by the IAF fighters,"" the sources, who wished to remain anonymous due to first hand involvement in operational matters‚ said. The sources added that other Indian intelligence agencies had also corroborated NTRO's assessment of active targets with inputs of similar number of Jaish operatives at the Balkot facility. The government is yet to announce the exact number of terrorists killed in the strike. However, IAF chief BS Dhanoa, at a press conference in Coimbatore on Monday, confirmed that the target had been destroyed by Indian fighter jets and that exact casualty numbers was something that the government would release.

 'Operation Bandar': IAF's code name for Balakot air strikes | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: “Operation Bandar (monkey)”. This was the innocuous sounding code-name given by IAF to the pre-dawn air strikes conducted by its Mirage-2000 fighters against the major Jaish-e-Mohammed training facility at Balakot in Pakistan on February 26, with the aim being to maintain overall secrecy of the operation. The Army, in turn, code-named its heightened operational alert and shoring up of defences along the border to thwart a possible Pakistan retaliation to the air strikes as “Operation Zafran"" (saffron flowers used in cooking), said sources on Friday. The Navy, however, did not give any specific name to the deployment of its warships and submarines in the north Arabian Sea because they were already there as part of Tropex-2019 (theatre level operational readiness exercise) underway at that time. The Navy just swiftly changed gears to put its exercise on hold and forward deploy its warships and submarines to deter any misadventure by Pakistan. “The idea behind the name 'Operation Bandar’ was to give a nondescript, mundane tag to the air strikes to maintain operational secrecy. It was chosen to make it sound like a routine, small-time affair,” said a source. A dozen Mirage-2000s, backed by IL-78 mid-air refuellers and AWACS (airborne warning and control system) aircraft, were deployed in the “strike package” against Balakot from Gwalior, Agra and Bareilly, instead of forward airbases to retain the element of surprise in the early hours of February 26, as was earlier reported by TOI. The IAF had also deployed “a decoy package” of Sukhoi-30MKIs ostensibly headed towards the JeM headquarters in Bahawalpur in the Punjab province to ensure Pakistani combat air patrols were lured away from the actual “strike package” meant for Balakot in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The IAF says it achieved its “strategic and operational aim of successfully bombing” the JeM terror facility at Balakot, hitting five of the six designated targets with the Spice-2000 precision-guided penetration bombs let loose by the Mirage-2000s. But the IAF did lose the MiG-21 being flown by Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who shot down an F-16 before he himself ejected and was captured by Pakistani forces, in the aerial skirmish in the Nowshera sector along the Line of Control a day after Operation Bandar. Moreover, at least one senior IAF officer and three others are also facing stringent disciplinary action for the grave operational lapses that led to “friendly fire” bringing down the Mi-17 helicopter – which killed six IAF personnel and a civilian -- at Budgam around the same time as the aerial skirmish, as reported by TOI earlier.

Both Pulwama and Shopian districts are part of the Anantnag Lok Sabha seat, where the third and final phase of polling will be held on Monday.

PM Modi appeals to people not to back 'mahamilawati' alliance - Times of India,"SONBHADRA (UP): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday came down heavily on the opposition alliance in Uttar Pradesh for raising questions on his caste, asserting that he belongs to the caste of all poor countrymen. Addressing an election rally in Sonbhadra, Modi continued to attack the Congress over its leader Sam Pitroda's ""hua to hua"" (It happened, so what?)""   remark on the anti-Sikh riots   in 1984. National security also figured prominently. Modi accused a previous coalition government of weakening the intelligence agencies and recalled that the Pokhran nuclear tests took place on this day 21 years back. ""They have destroyed Uttar Pradesh and now the SP and the BJP have come together to save themselves from destruction,"" he said, calling their alliance ""mahamilawati"" or adulterated. ""They have started a new thing about my caste,"" he said, in an apparent reference to Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati's jibe that he is a "" farzi backward"" - a ""fake"" OBC leader. ""I want to tell them that Modi belongs to just one caste - whatever caste the poor belong to, I belong to that caste,"" he said, listing the schemes that his government has launched for them. He claimed that the country's intelligence agencies suffered when a third front government, which included the Samajwadi Party, was in power at the Centre. ""Our intelligence agencies were weakened by an earlier ' mahamilawati' government, but the (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee government set that right,"" he said. ""Many people connected with our security and intelligence agencies have written a lot about this. They have written how they had made the intelligence network hollow and the country had to bear its consequences for long,"" he said.

I salute the scientists who brought laurels to the country with their hard work. This historic event in 1998 proves what strong political will can do for national security,"" he said. Referring to the Manmohan Singh term, he claimed the country got a weak government run by ""remote control"" after the one headed by Vajpayee. He said that government brought a bad name to the country. ""So many scams took place but the Congress and its people had no remorse as their way of thinking is ' hua to hua',"" he said making a fresh attack on the Congress for its leader Sam Pitroda's remarks. ""It shows the character and mentality of the party,"" he said. ""The hua to hua' remark reflects the arrogance of the Congress,"" he said.

 PM Modi attacks Congress for handling of terror incidents post-26/11 | India News - Times of India,"NOIDA (UP): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday again hit out at those seeking proof of India's air strike in Balakot, Pakistan and slammed the previous Congress government for its handling of terror incidents post-26/11 Mumbai attack. Addressing a public meeting in Greater Noida, Modi said the corrupt are opposing and abusing him in order to get votes. Modi, who became prime minister in 2014, said today India works on ' nayi reeti, nayi neeti' (new methods, new policies), asserting that after the terror attack in Uri (J-K) in 2016, the country for the ""first time taught terrorists a lesson in a language they understand"" with surgical strikes. ""Is it okay for you (the people) to have a government that does nothing? A chowkidar (referring to prime minister) who sleeps?,"" he asked the gathering of thousands. ""After Uri, proofs were sought. Our soldiers did something that has never happened before. Our soldiers struck terrorists inside their home. Terrorists and their guardians had not expected such action. They thought if India once did a surgical strike, they would again do something similar. So they had deployed forces along the border, but we went by air this time,"" Modi said. He said after the pre-dawn air strike on February 24, India was quietly monitoring the situation and it was Pakistan which started ""crying"" around 5.00 am that ""Modi has hit us"". ""They were thinking they can keep wounding India, wage attacks, proxy wars and India would not respond. The reason that enemies of India had this thought was (because of ) the attitude of the 'remote-controlled' government prior to 2014. That is why they (enemies) could nurture this attitude,"" the prime minster said. He said some politicians are making controversial statements which elicit applause in Pakistan and asked the people to identify such persons and decide if they want to trust them or not. "" Aaj har bhrasht ko Modi se kasht hai (Today every corrupt has a problem with Modi). There is a competition among them to abuse this chowkidar (watchman), they think abusing me will get them votes,"" Modi said.

Biggest news of 2019 India: News that defined India in 2019 | India News - Times of India,"The year 2019 proved dynamic for India, to say the least. Marked by key political decisions, space missions and Indians winning honours across the world, 2019 saw much activity round the year. And as we bade farewell to this year, here is a review of the events that defined India in 2019: 1. First time in history women enter Sabarimala TempleFor centuries no woman of menstruating age was allowed to enter the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala until January 2019 when two women, Kanakadurga (39) and Bindu Ammini (40), amid heavy police security, stepped inside the temple for the first time. The entry of women in the temple was banned by a Kerala high court in 1991. But in September 2018, a Supreme Court bench lifted the ban allowing women of all age groups to enter the temple. Following which, in January 2019, Kanakdurga and Bindu became the first-ever women to enter the temple. The SC order drew violent protests from the community which saw the verdict as interference in their religion. The 2018 apex court order, delivered by a five-judge bench, has now been referred to a larger seven-judge bench for review. 2. Terrorists attack Indian Army in Pulwama; IAF retaliates with cross-border airstrikesOn February 26, a vehicle-borne suicide bomber carried out a ghastly attack on a CRPF convoy on its way from Jammu to Srinagar leading to the death of 40 paramilitary personnel. The attack, the deadliest on Indian security forces since 1989, was carried out by Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Defense security force giving gun salute to CRPF jawan Vasanthakumar.A week later, on February 26, India retaliated by launching pre-dawn airstrikes destroying terror camps in Balakot, Pakistan. Within hours, the Pakistan Air Force responded and in the ensuing dogfight, IAF lost a MiG-21 fighter leading to the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman by the Pakistan forces. After 60 hours in captivity, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was released by Pakistan. The tensions between the two countries prevailed for several months. 3. Reservation for economically weaker sectionsAhead of 17th Lok Sabha elections, the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January brought the 124th Constitution Amendment Bill, 2019, which provided 10 per cent reservation to people from economically weaker sections (EWS) in government jobs and educational institutes. The amendment allowed those in the general category with an annual income of up to Rs 8 lakh to seek a reservation in government jobs and education. 4. Lok Sabha elections 2019India witnessed its 17th Lok Sabha elections in 2019 which proved to be historic for the ruling BJP. For the first time in three decades, a party was able to secure a clear majority in the Lok Sabha after BJP won 303 out of 543 seats. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won 353 seats. The massive mandate decimated the opposition parties. The Indian National Congress failed to impress and could win a mere 52 seats. Despite facing a massive anti-incumbency, the saffron party increased its vote share. Out of the 60.37 crore votes polled, BJP's vote share was 37.36 per cent and NDA's combined vote share was 45 per cent. The Congress, the largest party in the opposition, secured a vote share of 19.5 per cent. 5. Instant Triple Talaq becomes a criminal offenceThe Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 was given the presidential assent in July 2019 amidst objections from the Muslim community. In December 2017, the Supreme Court had declared instant triple talaq unconstitutional. Drawing upon Supreme Court's verdict, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill was tabled in the parliament in 2017 but it failed to pass in both the houses. However, in July 2019, the Bill was passed in both the houses and the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, made instant triple talaq by Muslim men a criminal offence punishable by a jail term of up to three years. 6. Jammu & Kashmir loses special statusThe Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government in August announced the scrapping of Article 370 which gave special status to the state. In addition to scrapping to Article 370, the government also announced to split the state into two union territories— one was J&K with a legislature and second was Ladakh without a legislature. Abrogation of Article 370 was heavily condemned by various stakeholders in the country as well as witnessed scepticism from the international community. The abrogation was followed by a massive clampdown in the Valley, which included a heavy deployment of security forces, arrest of political leaders, including former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, and snapping of internet connections and phones lines. 7. Chandrayaan-2It was both a moment of joy and despair for the country after Isro's lunar exploration mission succeeded in reaching the lunar orbit but Vikram lander failed to make the intended soft landing and crashed. The Pragyan lunar rover also crashed along with the Vikram lander. The objective of Isro's Chandrayaan-2 mission is to map and study the variations in lunar surface composition, as well as the location and abundance of lunar water. The spacecraft was launched on July 22 by GSLV Mark III. It reached the Moon's orbit on August 20. 8. Ayodhya verdictThe Supreme Court of India brought the curtain down on one of the longest and the most historic legal disputes in the history of modern India. The apex court on November 9 delivered the final verdict in the Ayodhya land dispute case. The court ordered the disputed land (2.77 acres) to be handed over to a central government-created trust to build the Ram Janmabhoomi temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternate five acres of land in another place to the Sunni Waqf Board to build a mosque. 9. CAA/NRCAfter a heated debate in Parliament, the Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed leading to country-wide protests. The controversial Act grants citizenship status to religious minorities, barring the Muslims, persecuted in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The passage of the Bill led to widespread protest across the country. In several places, the protests turned violent leading to loss of life and property. Opposition parties accused the government of trying to divide the country on communal lines with the introduction of the Act. The government refuted the allegations, claiming that the Act grants refuge to persecuted minorities in neighbouring countries. 10. Abhijit Banerjee wins Nobel Prize in Economics along with two othersBanerjee became the tenth Indian or a man of Indian-origin to win the prestigious Nobel Prize. Banerjee shared the prize with his economist-wife Esther Duflo and another US-based economist Michael Kremer. The Indian-American economist who is currently the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology won the prize ""for an experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.""

Pakistan on July 16 opened its airspace for India after some five months of restrictions imposed in the wake of a standoff with New Delhi earlier this year. Following the Balakot air strikes, Pakistan had closed its airspace on February 26. In March, Pakistan partially opened its airspace but kept it banned for the Indian flights. India also banned its airspace for flights to Pakistan. Federal minister for aviation Ghulam Sarwar Khan had said the CAA suffered a loss of Rs 8.5 billion because of airspace restrictions since February.

Election Commission examining PM's Balakot air strike remarks - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks asking first-time voters to dedicate their vote to those who carried out the Balakot air strike continue to be under the examination of the Election Commission to ascertain whether they violate its directive to political parties against using the armed forces in their campaign, sources said Friday. The Commission is understood to have sought certain details from poll authorities in Maharashtra in this regard. Local poll authorities are learnt to have told the EC here that Modi's remarks are prima facie violative of its orders on armed forces.

Abhinandan Varthaman:  Cooling down process of Wing Commander Abhinandan concludes | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The IAF and security agencies have completed a nearly two-week-long debriefing of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who spent around 60 hours in Pakistan after being captured during a dogfight on February 27, officials said. They said the IAF pilot's medical treatment has also concluded and he will go on sick leave for at least three weeks before resuming duty. A medical board to be constituted by the IAF will review medical fitness of Varthaman to help the IAF top brass decide whether he can return to fighter cockpit as desired by him, they said. Varthaman underwent the debriefing sessions by the security agencies as part of a cooling down process. He was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during an aerial combat. He downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan before his plane was hit. Varthaman was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan. In the national capital, the IAF pilot was first taken to the Air Force Central Medical Establishment, a compact and specialised medical evaluation centre for aircrew of all the three services. Later he was brought to the Army's Research and Referral hospital. After he was captured, Varthaman showed courage and grace in handling the most difficult circumstances for which he was praised by politicians, strategic affairs experts, ex-servicemen, celebrities and people in general. Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa met Varthaman separately on March 2 during which he apprised them about the mental trauma he was subjected to during his captivity in Pakistan. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after Indian fighters bombed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed's biggest training camp near Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. Pakistan retaliated by attempting to target Indian military installations the next day. However, the IAF thwarted their plans.

" Travesty that Congress, allies rallying behind terror-exporting Pakistan: BJP | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Keeping the heat on the Congress over the Balakot air strike issue, the BJP said on Wednesday it was a travesty that the opposition party and its allies were ""rallying behind the terror-exporting Pakistan"" when the whole world is backing India. Taking a dig at the Congress, BJP spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao said that seeing the ""cries and the critical comments"" of the Congress and its political friends, one is left wondering if they have been hit by the strike that ""killed an unprecedentedly large number of terrorists"" in Pakistan's territory. He said in a statement that ""irresponsible"" comments by various Congress party leaders over India's air strike on terror bases in Pakistan show their desperation and frustration at the unprecedented success of the Indian armed forces and their valour. ""At a time when the entire nation is filled with national pride for the success of the forces, the Congress party leaders and many of their friends are speaking the language of Pakistan and hurting the sentiments and morale of our forces,"" Rao said. It was a travesty that the Congress and its allies were ""rallying behind the terror-exporting Pakistan"", he said. Rao said India and its brave forces are brimming with confidence and are celebrating the rising power and stock of a 'New India', while the Congress and their political friends appear to be feeling threatened of their political future in a rising India. ""Putting their political interests above that of the nation and by repeatedly questioning the action by our forces, the Congress and their political friends are guilty of furthering Pakistan's agenda for their narrow electoral considerations. This is not just condemnable but a sure path for their electoral disaster,"" he said. The Congress and its friends are being increasingly seen as ""cheerleaders"" for Pakistan, he alleged. The BJP and opposition parties have been involved in a bitter war of words with the latter asking the government to show proof of the high level of casualties of terrorists in the air strikes, as claimed by many ruling party leaders. The opposition has accused the BJP of politicising sacrifices of armed forces, while the ruling party has hit back, saying its rivals were lowering the morale of armed forces.

Surgical strike today: Four reasons why this is a totally different ballgame | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Indian government has confirmed it carried out pre-emptive strikes against terror training camps in Pakistan. Here are four reasons why this strike marks a paradigm shift in India’s response to Pakistan on terror. Firstly, India’s foreign secretary has confirmed India struck the biggest training camp of Jaish e Mohammed (JeM) in Balakot in the early hours on Tuesday. This is unlike the previous strikes because it is for the first time in recent times that India has struck deep inside Pakistan territory. Earlier, the focus would be mostly along the LoC to hit terror targets. A very large number of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders are believed to have been eliminated in this strike. This includes Maulana Yousuf Azhar (alias Ustad Ghouri), the brother-in-law of JeM chief Masood Azhar. Secondly, this is the first time Indian Air Force (IAF) has crossed the LoC to hit terror training camps in Pakistan. The last time such an attack took place was during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Even during the 1999 Kargil war, IAF jets pounded terror locations but took care not to cross the LoC under any circumstances. Pakistan Army too has acknowledged the airspace violation in Muzafarabad sector. Thirdly, this is a huge embarrassment for Pakistan’s Army that Indian forces crossed their airspace and left after eliminating terror training camps. Just last Friday, Pakistan Army’s spokesperson Maj Gen Ghafoor had said, “Pakistan armed forces will never be surprised by you. But let me assure you, we shall surprise you”. Despite all their claims, they will still have to answer how IAF planes crossed, struck targets and went back without being challenged by Pakistan. Fourthly, till now India’s stand on dealing with Pakistan on terror was more about surgical strikes in LoC and creating international pressure on Pakistan to take action against non-state actors. This is for the first time in many decades that India has taken the fight right into Pakistan territory. The strike at Balakot is ample proof that the Modi government will not think twice before carrying out such attacks again if the need so arises. The Pakistani establishment needs to ‘awaken’ themselves to the new rules of engagement with India.

 'Should I count how many mosquitoes I killed': V K Singh on Balakot casualty debate | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Union minister V K Singh on Wednesday used a mosquito metaphor to address the debate on casualty figures in the Balakot air strikes, asking if he was expected to sit and count how many he killed at night or ""sleep in comfort"".

Now, should I sit and count how many mosquitoes I killed or sleep in comfort,"" Singh tweeted on Wednesday in an apparent reference to Congress demands from the government on proof of casualty figures in the air-strikes. रात ३.३० बजे मच्छर बहुत थे, तो मैंने HIT मारा। अब मच्छर कितने मारे, ये गिनने बैठूँ, या आराम से सो जाऊँ? #GenerallySaying— Vijay Kumar Singh (@Gen_VKSingh) 1551841788000On Tuesday, Haryana minister Anil Vij had tweeted a similar comment.

At the time of the aerial strikes, he was posted at the Western Air Command in New Delhi. Negi has also commanded the 51 Squadron earlier. Wing Commander Abhinandan was also part of this Squadron on February 27 when he flew valiantly and shot down a Pakistani F-16 in aerial combat while thwarting an attack from the Pakistan Air Force.

 Rafale replica erected outside IAF chief BS Dhanoa's residence | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A replica of the Rafale fighter jet has been erected outside Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa's official residence which is situated opposite the Congress party's headquarters. Earlier, a model of a Sukhoi Su-30 was set up at the same place, but that was replaced by a Rafale fighter jet a few weeks ago, official sources said. The Congress has been alleging massive irregularities in the Rafale deal and has been targeting the government over selection of the Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Defence as an offset partner for Dassault Aviation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the procurement of a batch of 36 Rafale jets after talks with the then French President Francois Hollande on April 10, 2015, in Paris. The final deal, worth Rs 56,000 crore, was sealed on September 23, 2016. The government has rejected the allegations by the Congress and other opposition parties. The first Rafale aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in September. Weeks after India's Balakot strikes, IAF chief Dhanoa had said India could have achieved better results if the country had Rafale jets. The first Rafale jet expected to be handed over to the Indian Air Force in September this year. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"IAF chief BS Dhanoa: IAF doesn't count casualties, govt will make statement on Balakot toll | India News - Times of India","COIMBATORE: IAF chief B S Dhanoa on Monday declined to comment on the death toll in the Balakot strike, saying it was for the government to provide details on the number of terrorists killed and the Air Force only sees if a target has been   hit or not   . Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by Pakistan on February 27 and released on March 1,   would fly a fighter jet if he was fit   , Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said. ""We don't take chances with the medical fitness of a pilot,"" he said at a press conference in his first comments since the   February 26 attack   on a Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Balakot in Pakistan's Khyber Paktunkhwa province. The Air Force, he said, is not in a position to clarify how many people were inside. ""We don't count human casualties. We count what targets we have hit or not hit,"" he said. The bomb damage assessment that is done post a mission only calculates the target that has been hit or not hit, the air chief noted. ""We can't count how many people have died. That depends on how many people were there,"" Dhanoa said, adding that a statement on the number of terrorists killed will be made by the government. Asked about reports suggesting that the bombs were dropped away from the target, he said, ""Our report says otherwise."" Referring to Pakistan using F-16 aircraft in its offensive against India last week, Dhanoa said, ""I don't know what is the end-user agreement between America and Pakistan. If the end-user agreement was that they will not use it for offensive purposes, then I think they have violated that end-user agreement."" India, he said, has pieces of the Amraam missile which it displayed. ""Obviously, I think they have lost a F-16 aircraft in that combat. So, obviously, they have been using that aircraft against us,"" he added. According to him, had the Indian Air Force dropped bombs in a jungle at Balakot there would have been no need for Pakistan to respond. ""The target has been clearly amplified by the foreign secretary in his statement. And, of course, if we plan to hit the target, we hit the target. Otherwise, why would he (Pakistan) have responded,"" he said. The Rafale jet should come into India's inventory by September, the Air Force chief said. In response to a question regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that Rafale jets would have a made a difference, he said, ""Honourable Prime Minister has made the statement. I will not comment on that."" When an adversary attacks you, every aircraft is used, Dhanoa said, adding that the MiG 21 jet used in the dog fight with Pakistan is an upgraded aircraft with advanced weapons system. ""The MiG-21 Bison is in our inventory, why not use it?...I will not comment on the ongoing operation because they are still ongoing. MIG-21 Bison is capable. It has been upgraded... It has got a better weapons system, better radars, better air-to-air missiles... whatever it takes to make it from third generation to 3.5 generation (aircraft) or so,"" Dhanoa told reporters. Though he could not comment on the politics, he was happy Abhinandan was home, he said. ""Whether he flies again or not depends on his medical fitness. That is why post ejection, he has undergone a medical check. Thereafter, whatever treatment is required, we have given to him. Once he gets his medical fitness, then only he will get into a fighter cockpit,"" Dhanoa said. The Air Force, Dhanoa said, has to get its act together and find out what caused the mid-air clash ahead of the opening of the Bengaluru air show on February 19 and helicopter crash in Kashmir last week.

 Abhinandan’s statue on display in Pakistan museum | India News - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: A statue of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, whose fighter jet was shot down by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in a dogfight over Jammu and Kashmir earlier this year, has been put on display at a museum in the southern port city of Karachi. Dressed in a copy of his Indian uniform, a large effigy of the pilot has been installed in an exhibit at the PAF Museum in Karachi alongside another statue bearing the likeness of the Pakistan Army officer who had apparently save him from a mob. An entire section has been dedicated to “Operation Swift Retort”, the code name for the PAF’s response to the Indian air strikes on alleged terrorist camps of the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) in Balakot, northwest Pakistan. The tail section and other debris of his MiG-21 fighter jet, which was downed over Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, are displayed front and centre at the very entrance to the newly opened museum section inaugurated by Pakistan Air Chief Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan on November 6. After his capture, the Pakistani military had released a video showing him sipping a cup of tea and politely refusing to answer questions but proclaiming that the tea offered to him was “fantastic”. The mug from which he was seen sipping tea is placed next to his effigy along with a mess receipt framed on the wall jokingly charging Varthaman for the tea. He was released several days later in a bid to defuse the tension. The gallery also contains images re-enacting the moment his plane was shot down, and photographs showing him being handed back to India at the Wagah border crossing. “When Abhinandan tried to attack he was arrested and within two days he was returned as a goodwill gesture to give a message of peace,” Hamna Shaikh, a college student visiting the exhibit, was quoted by Reuters as saying. “All his belongings are now here on display, it felt very good today seeing all these articles,” she added.

This little-known aspect of demonetisation was revealed by former IAF chief B S Dhanoa while speaking at the IIT-B’s annual Techfest on Saturday. Dhanoa mentioned this while highlighting some of the unknown roles of the IAF. He said the air force has risen to the occasion during natural disasters like floods and earthquakes. Dhanoa regretted that indigenisation has not fructified as much as one wished for. He said IAF has to depend upon 32 diverse platforms from nine different countries. At the same time, he said if the defence procurement procedure was politicised, “the whole system will become backward”. “Slowing down defence procurement will affect India,” Dhanoa said. According to him, when the Balakot strike was approved, the government sent a political message to Pakistan that henceforth acts of terrorism will come with a heavy price. “The Pulwama attack made the government change its strategy with regards to the response to terrorist attacks,” he told the huge gathering. According to him, the IAF needs to modernise in order to provide a credible deterrence. The IAF has identified 18 projects in the current financial year under the technology development fund.

At the time of the attack, almost all the trainers and recruits had access to mobile phones, the signals of which were closely tracked by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO). After the IAF strikes, all the signals disappeared without a trace, intel sources said. Those present at the Balakot facility included 18 senior commanders of JeM for training the terror recruits. In a huge blow to JeM, all of them, who were veterans of the war against the US in Afghanistan, are deemed missing. These include Mufti Umar, Maulana Javed, Maulana Aslam, Maulana Ajmal, Maulana Zubair, Maulana Abdul Gafur Kashmiri, Maulana Qudratullah, Maulana Qasim and Maulana Junaid. All of them were close to Masood Azhar and were handpicked by the JeM chief after the Afghanistan campaign.

 India-Pakistan meeting on Kartarpur Corridor begins | India News - Times of India,"ATTARI (AMRITSAR): A meeting between officials of India and Pakistan to finalise the modalities for setting up of a corridor linking the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistani town of Kartarpur with Gurdaspur district in Punjab commenced in Amritsar Thursday, officials said. The talks are being held at the Indian side of the Attari-Wagah border, they said. It is the first meeting between officials of India and Pakistan to discuss the Kartarpur Corridor issue, amid heightened tensions between the two nations over the Pulwama terror attack, followed by India's pre-emptive air strike on Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) camps in Balakot and Pakistan's subsequent retaliation. In the meeting, New Delhi is likely to raise the issue of hassle-free access to the Indian pilgrims besides asking Islamabad to insulate Sikh pilgrims visiting the shrine in Pakistan from pro-Khalistan propaganda. From the Indian side, officials comprised representatives from the Union home ministry, external affairs ministry, BSF, National Highways Authority of India and the Punjab government. Last November, both India and Pakistan agreed to set up the Kartarpur corridor to link the historic Gurdwara Darbar Sahib - the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev - to Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur. Kartarpur Sahib is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. The corridor will facilitate visa-free travel of Indian Sikh pilgrims to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur. Pakistan has committed to open the corridor in November this year on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had on November 26 last year laid the foundation stone of the Kartarpur Corridor in Gurdaspur district. Two days later, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan laid the foundation stone of the corridor in Narowal, 125 km from Lahore. The Punjab cabinet had passed a special resolution to set up a Dera Baba Nanak Development Authority for the development and beautification of the area in and around Dera Baba Nanak. A Kartarpur Gate has also been proposed to be set up on the Indian side of the International Border which would stand out as a monumental symbol to commemorate the 550th 'Prakash Purb' (birth anniversary) of Guru Nanak Dev.

"IAF strike satellite images: IAF rebuts ‘satellite image’ report,says intended targets were hit | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Amid conflicting claims of “satellite evidence” on whether India did strike the Jaish-e-Mohammed camp at Balakot in Pakistan, the Indian air force( IAF) maintained that it had hit the intended targets and that precision ‘Spice’ bombs had pierced the roofs of identified buildings and exploded inside. Isro satellite that could have scanned JeM camp after bombingA Reuters report on Wednesday referred to images produced by Planet Labs Inc, a San Francisco-based private satellite operator, showing at least six buildings on the site of the Jaish camp on March 4. The report claimed the image was virtually unchanged from an April 2018 photo and had no signs of a bombing. “There are no discernible holes in the roofs of buildings, no signs of scorching, blown-out walls, displaced trees around the madrassa or other signs of an aerial attack,” the report said. It quoted Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Non-proliferation programme at Middlebury Institute of International Studies, who “confirmed” that the satellite picture showed the structures in question. Indian government sources have previously said the attack did not target the entire Jaish campus, but only 5-6 specific buildings. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa has said the designated targets were hit even as he did not offer an estimate of how many persons may have died. Even as a political battle raged, with Congress demanding the government clarify the accounts on casualties, and BJP countering, asking why the opposition was doubting the armed forces, television channels on Wednesday played yet another set of satellite images claiming that the targets at the Jaish terror camp had been hit. The images showed areas that were identified as blast impact sites where vegetation was allegedly damaged. The TV reports claimed that this was the result of the blasts at the buildings that were hit. It was also alleged that the bodies of terrorists at the camp might have been buried at the site to hide evidence and there were efforts to rebuild the roofs. So far, though representatives of foreign media have visited Balakot and some accounts had residents claiming that there had been few or no casualties, no one has been allowed at the camp itself that is near Balakot on a hilltop in a wooded area. Some foreign correspondents have reported that locals have spoken of a few dozen bodies being removed from the area. The IAF is sticking to its stand that it hit the intended targets in pre-dawn strikes on February 26. “The bombs, which were pre-loaded with satellite images and geographical coordinates of the JeM facility, pierced the roofs of the targeted buildings and exploded inside. The inmates would have been killed by the blast and shock waves,” a source said. Rejecting commercially-available satellite imagery being used by some experts to claim there was no major visible external damage to the facility, IAF sources said it was up to the government to decide whether it wanted to release the SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and other pictures captured by Indian surveillance platforms during the strikes.

Pakistan to review re-opening of airspace for Indian flights; minister says no change in status quo - Times of India,"LAHORE: Pakistan will review re-opening of its airspace for Indian flights on May 15 amid heightened Indo-Pak military tensions, a civil aviation official said Sunday, but a senior minister indicated that the status quo will remain till the elections are over in India. Pakistan fully closed its airspace after an Indian Air Force strike on a terror camp in Balakot on February 26. However, Pakistan on March 27, opened its airspace for all flights except for New Delhi, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. ""The Pakistani government will decide whether to lift or not its airspace ban for the Indian flights on May 15,"" Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spokesperson Mujtaba Baig told PTI on Sunday. He said that in the May 15 meeting the officials and ministers of all ministries concerned will participate and a decision will be taken about lifting of ban or not on the Pakistani airspace 'operational and overflying' for India. ""The decision will be notified any time on May 15,"" Baig said. However, Prime Minister Imran Khan's close aide and federal science and technology minister Fawad Chaudhry doesn't see any change in the status quo till conclusion of Lok Sabha polls in India. ""Status quo will remain till the elections are over in India. I don't see any improvement in relations between Pakistan and India till the elections are over and a new government is installed. The ban on airspace by each other I think will also continue till Indian polls,"" Chaudhry told PTI. Pakistan and India had closed their airspace for each other on February 26 after rise in tension between the two nuclear countries. When asked had not the CAA written to Imran Khan about huge financial losses the Pakistan International Airlines, other private airlines and CAA were facing because of closure of its profitable routes because of ban of Indian airspace, Baig said: ""It is a bilateral matter to be resolved by the both governments."" Owing to ban on its airspace by India, Pakistan has suspended its operation for Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur which is causing a loss of millions of rupees per day. PIA used to operate four flights to Kuala Lumpur, two to Bangkok and two to New Delhi. A senior PIA official told PTI that the national flag carrier's loss is running into billions of rupees because of suspension of our flights especially to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. ""We are not only facing the huge financial loss but also losing our passengers to other airlines,"" he said, adding that this matter should now be resolved. ""If land and rail routes are operational between Pakistan and India, what's wrong with the air route,"" the official questioned. The airlines and civil aviation authorities of both the countries are enduring massive losses. The flights between Europe to Far-East are not only facing massive financial losses, but the flight duration has also increased, while the airlines have also increased their ticket prices. Pakistan in mid-April had opened one of its 11 air routes for west-bound flights from India and airlines such as Air India and Turkish Airlines have started using it. The operating cost for Air India, which flies to destinations in Europe and the US, reportedly has increased significantly as it had to take longer routes due to closure of Pakistan airspace.

"Air strike good, but diplomacy is way forward: Experts | Bengaluru News - Times of India","BENGALURU: Former diplomat Latha Reddy, while applauding the armed forces and diplomats for their efforts, said bravado, jingoism and domestic compulsions shouldn’t dictate how India acts against Pakistan. Instead, a patient diplomatic route should be seen as the best option. “We are proud of our armed forces, but let’s not rush to attack due to domestic compulsions ... Pakistan hasn’t changed fundamentally by what happened in Balakot or thereafter, and it has not learnt any lesson,” Reddy said during a discussion on “India & Pakistan: Between Pulwama, Balakot and Bhimber, what has changed and what hasn’t?” here on Monday. Conceding that diplomacy is a slow tool, she said it is still the best option to deal with Pakistan given its geopolitical advantage. “Talking about what happened since Pulwama (the attack by JeM on February 14), I must say that in diplomatic terms it has been a success: Not a single country has censured India and neither has any openly supported Pakistan. Our diplomats around the world have done well to prevent a negative stand against India,” Reddy said. Lt Gen (retd) Prakash Menon, while stating that the Indian government had no choice but to respond to Pulwama, however, said it was also important to note how the strike was projected thereafter. “If we think that with this we have managed to deter Pakistan from using terror as a front to further its foreign policy, then we are not completely right. The air strike and the message from it has only limited use. They will carry on,” Menon said. Prof Suba Chandran, dean, School of Conflict and Security Studies at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), argued how Pakistan’s behaviour post Pulwama, especially the way the country reacted after India’s strike, has more to do with its problems on other side of the border and global compulsions than what is being projected.

India Pakistan war: How India and Pakistan differ | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In the last 48 hours, India and Pakistan both struck targets in each other's territory but were quick to assert that they were ""non-military"" targets. But there was a world of difference between the two claims.  India struck a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa early on Tuesday, on receiving intelligence that the group was planning a series of suicide attacks in India. In its statement, the Indian government said, ""This non-military pre-emptive action was specifically targeted at the JeM camp."" The Pakistani foreign ministry's statement on Wednesday morning said that it had struck ""non-military targets"" across the LoC in J&K to demonstrate its ""right, will and capability for self defence"". It further said, ""PAF undertook strikes across LoC from Pakistani airspace. Sole purpose of this action was to demonstrate our right, will and capability for self defence.""  India's rationale for calling the Balakot camp a non-military one was to distinguish between an attack on the Pakistani state as opposed to a pre-emptive strike on a terror camp. In addition, as the Indian statement clarified, the ""selection of the target was also conditioned by our desire to avoid civilian casualties. The facility is located in thick forest on a hilltop far away from any civilian presence"". Pakistan did not have a similar target, so anything they targeted would necessarily be a civilian or military target. Islamabad's reason for describing them as ""non-military"" was to avert any reason for an Indian retaliation.  India rejected Pakistan's contention and in its demarche to Islamabad, accused Pakistan of attacking Indian military targets. This indicates that India saw Pakistan's misadventure today as an act of war. In Video:India issues demarche to PakistanDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Army was ready for conventional war with Pakistan after Balakot: Sources | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In the run up to Balakot strikes, Army chief General Bipin Rawat very categorically conveyed to the top brass of the government that his force was fully ready to deal with any ground offensive by Pakistan and take the battle into the enemy territory, top military sources said. The Indian Army was prepared for a conventional warfare with Pakistan which would have included going inside Pakistan, the sources told PTI. The Army chief informed the government about preparedness of his force when it was considering various options, including carrying out an aerial raid, to punish Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack. General Rawat, at a closed door interaction with a group of retiring Army officials on Monday, said the force was combat ready for any hostilities from Pakistan Army after the Balakot strikes, the sources said. Explaining General Rawat's comments, a military official said what the Army chief meant was that Indian Army was ready to take the battle into Pakistan. The sources said Indian Army had finalised contracts to procure ammunition worth Rs 11,000 crore after the Uri terror attack in September 2016, and it has received 95 per cent of the total order. The Army has also finalised 33 contracts worth Rs 7,000 crore for procuring critical armaments while another set of purchases at a cost of Rs 9,000 crore is at an advanced stage. Indian Air Force bombed terror group Jaish-e-Muhammed's biggest training camp near Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26, in response to the Pulwama attack. Pakistan retaliated by attempting to target Indian military installations on Wednesday. However, the IAF thwarted their plans. The Indian strike on the JeM camp came 12 days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Kashmir that killed 40 soldiers. Sources said that the Indian Army has significantly improved availability of key armaments and ammunition in the last over two years, admitting that their shortage was a major issue earlier. The availability of arms and armaments has improved significantly since the Uri attack, said a senior official. In March last year, the vice chiefs of the three services were granted additional financial powers to carry out specific procurement to ensure operational preparedness. In the wake of the Pulwama terror attack, the government granted emergency powers to the three services to procure weapons and military hardware to enhance their operational preparedness along the border with Pakistan. The government also relaxed certain rules to cut delays in military purchase like allowing the three services to procure required weapons and equipment from a single vendor. In the wake of Pakistan's sharp reaction to India's decisions on Jammu and Kashmir, the Army has been put on high alert along the Line of Control.

 PM Modi himself questioning air strike in Pakistan: Congress | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has himself ""questioned"" the recent anti-terror air strike in Pakistan by his remarks that the country is feeling the absence of Rafale fighter jets as the results could have been different if India had these aircraft. The party also said it had neither sought proof of such strike earlier nor is it asking for it now. ""The Prime Minister has himself questioned the air strike. He said had the Rafale jets been there (with the IAF), the results would have been different. What is the meaning of this?"" Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari posed during a press conference here. Asserting that the Prime Minister should himself explain what would have been different with Rafale jets, he held Modi responsible for the delay in induction of the French-made fighter jets into the IAF by ""cancelling"" the earlier negotiations. Modi had on Saturday hit out at the opposition for doubting the armed forces on the anti-terror air strike in Pakistan and said the country was feeling the absence of Rafale fighter jets as the results could have been different if India had these aircraft. ""India is feeling the absence of Rafale. The entire country is saying in one voice today, if we had Rafale probably the result would have been different. The country has suffered a lot due to selfish interests earlier and now politics over Rafale,"" he had said at the India Today Conclave.

 Attempts being made to reactivate Balakot terror camp: Govt | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday said inputs indicate that attempts are being made to reactivate terror camps at Balakot in Pakistan which was bombed by the Indian Air Force fighters. Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy said in Rajya Sabha that the central government is committed to take all necessary steps to protect the borders of the country and maintain its integrity and sovereignty. ""Inputs indicate that attempts are being made by Pakistan-based terror outfits to reactivate its camp at Balakot and restart their religious and Jihadi indoctrination courses against India,"" he said replying a written question. The fighters of the Indian Air Force had bombed and destroyed the terror camp at Balakot on February 26 after terrorists attacked a convoy of CRPF vehicles, killing 40 jawans on February 14. Reddy said the government has adopted a policy of zero-tolerance towards terrorism and the security forces are taking effective and continuous action in countering it as a result of which a large number of terrorists have been neutralised in Jammu and Kashmir during the past few years. The minister said in Jammu and Kashmir, this year till November 17, as many as 594 terror incidents have taken place in which 37 civilians and 79 security personnel were killed. He said a total of 614 terrorist incidents have taken place in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018 in which 39 civilians and 91 security personnel were killed.

Balakot air strikes hits supplies of surgicals from Pakistan | Nagpur News - Times of India,"NAGPUR: The air strikes on Pakistan after Pulwama terror attack have hit the dealers in surgical equipment in both the countries. Soon after the attack that left over 40 CRPF personnel dead, India withdrew the most favoured nation (MFN) status to Pakistan and levied 200% duty on imports. India depends on imports from Pakistan for instruments used in open surgery. These are procedures in which the body parts have to be cut open. These include instruments like scissors, needle holders or forceps. The items are priced in the range of Rs500 a unit and go up to Rs10,000, said sources in the business. Supplies from Pakistan are preferred because of lower cost and good quality. Though German instruments are considered the best, items from Pakistan rank second because of cost. After MFN status was withdrawn, a 200% duty was imposed on imports. This has now held up deals between Pakistani and Indian traders. TOI talked to members of Surgical Instruments Manufacturers of Pakistan (SIMAP) in Sialkot. The city in Pakistani province of Punjab is a major hub for units making open surgery instruments. Senior SIMAP sources confirmed a sizable trade that used to happen with India has now come to a standstill. “As much as 100 million US dollar business was taking place with India until the MFN status was removed. Now a number of consignments are lying at Indian airports because Indian traders have refused to take the delivery after the duty was hiked. Payment of a number of traders in Pakistan has also been blocked on account of this. This is a helpless situation but businessmen on both the sides know the matter is not in their hands,” said a source. The SIMAP source said Pakistani traders could still find a market for their goods. If India does not buy, goods can be sold to China or any other country, but there is a likelihood of a supply deficit in India in coming days. Traders in Nagpur do not directly import these things. They get their supplies from importers in Punjab and Rajasthan. TOI talked to a dealer in Jaipur who wished not to be named. The dealer said rates of these items had now gone up three times. With no fresh supplies, traders are only managing with the stock lying with them. Another trader at Nagpur said some are planning to route Pakistani consignments through UAE. However, they fear the duty may be lowered in coming days. If it happens, those going by the UAE route would incur a loss, he said. Former chairman of Central India Surgical Dealers Association Prince Uppal said the Indian industry could see it as an opportunity. “Indian units can emerge and capture the market. There is no need for a hue an cry over the issue,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
Surgical strike 2: IAF crosses LoC for the first time since 1971 war | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: It wasn’t a question of whether India will strike back or not, but of when and the timing of the attack. Indian Air Force targeted JeM, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen training camps around 330am on Tuesday. The public anger after the terror attack in Pulwama that killed 40 CRPF jawans on February 14 had put immense pressure on the Narendra Modi government to act. As per reports,   IAF dropped 1,000 kg bombs on targets in Balakot   , Muzafarrabad and Chakoti completely destroying many terror camps.

" Action against terror took place in Kashmir, not in Pakistan: Sharad Pawar | India News - Times of India","MUMBAI: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday slammed the Narendra Modi government's assertion of ""hitting the enemy in his home"", claiming that such actions against terrorists actually took place in Kashmir and not in Pakistan. Stating that cultural communalism had helped the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politically, he warned that one community standing against another was dangerous for the country's social harmony. During his Lok Sabha poll campaign, Prime Minister Modi had said ""ghar mein ghus ghus ke marenge"" (we will enter the terrorists' homes and eliminate them). He had made these remarks after the Indian Air Force targeted a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot following a suicide bomber belonging to the proscribed organisation ramming his explosives-laden vehicle into a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama on February 14, killing 40 men. During a live chat with people on Facebook from his office here, Pawar noted that the public used to like when Modi, during his poll campaign and rallies, said his government would enter the houses of enemies and kill them. However, the Maratha leader was quick to claim that ""the attacks that had taken place did not happen in Pakistan, but in Kashmir. And Kashmir is a part of India"". ""Hence, whatever steps the Modi government took to put a check on the activities in Kashmir, that does not mean you entered Pakistan,"" he said. ""People do not have information about the Line of Control (LoC) and the situation there. So, they felt some action had been taken against Pakistan,"" the former Union minister said. He also alleged that systematic efforts were made to create an aversion towards a particular community. ""Cultural communalism received an indirect boost in the country, which politically benefitted the BJP,"" Pawar said.

He stated that people are coming at regular intervals to demand the N95 masks, but the demand skyrocketed on Sunday. Times ViewGovernments at the Centre and in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and UP need to start behaving as if they recognise that the NCR is facing a monumental public health emergency. This is no time for blame games or cornering credit for what few positive measures have been taken. Even concerted action by all governments may not be enough to deal with the crisis in the short to medium term, but anything less would be criminal neglect of their duty and a complete abdication of leadership. Let’s also not argue about which source of pollution deserves priority action. Every source, minor or major, needs urgent tackling. Central and state governments should jointly commit to a 5-year plan with annual targets of AQI reduction to less than 100 by 2025, and below 50 soon after. Breathing this toxic air is imperiling all of us, particularly children, even if we can ensure we won’t have to do so in future. The damage already done will continue to extract its toll in the years to come, so every extra day of inhaling this poison is one day too many. As citizens and victims, we need to pitch in – through efforts such as car pooling and maximising use of public transport. We need to treat these tasks as if our lives depend on them – because they do.Outside AIIMS, Vinod Kumar of Ambey Medicine corner said that post-Diwali, he has sold at least 20 masks every day. “But we have sold the maximum number of masks today,” Kumar added. “Most people who are buying masks are already aware of the specifications they need to look out for and directly ask for N95 masks.” The sale of masks was also high in residential areas. “Usually we sell around eight masks daily but today we have sold over 20 masks.

Inside Balakot madrassa struck by India: Pakistan not ready to give up secrets - Times of India,"JABA: A madrasaa, or Islamic school, on a remote hilltop in northeastern Pakistan that was the target of the Indian air strike just over six weeks ago is still not ready to give up its secrets. For the first time since the Indian Air Force jets targeted a Jaish-e-Muhammed terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistani authorities on Wednesday allowed a group of journalists working for foreign news organisations, and foreign diplomats based in Islamabad, access to the site. According to BBC Urdu, the group was flown from Islamabad in a helicopter to Jabba in Balakot. The visitors trekked for about one-and-a-half hour to reach the madrassa on the top of a mountain surrounded by lush green trees. The expectation among some of the visitors was that it might help settle a number of mysteries about the attack. But the journalists and diplomats, most of whom spent well over an hour climbing steep slopes to get to the madrasa in the Jaba village area near the town of Balakot, didn’t get enough time to make any kind of informed assessment. They were mostly restricted to looking around the madrassa’s main building. They were hurried away by the Pakistani army, which organised the trip, after less than half an hour. Those arriving by vehicle had even less time. The interactions with teachers and about 100 children at the madrassa - from the very young to older teenagers - were also limited. The visitors were shown a group of children learning passages from the Quran partly by rocking their heads back and forward in rhythm. One teacher said he had worked at the madrassa for six years. The visitors were shown students reciting verses from the Quran at the madrasa situated near the impact site. (Reuters Photo)Too little, too lateAt least three of the diplomats, who were mainly from Western countries and the Middle East and included some military attaches, said it was very difficult to draw any firm conclusions because of the six-week delay in gaining access and the restricted time allowed to look around. On the trek up to the compound, past small sheep and goat farms and through pastoral scenery on a beautiful spring day, journalists and diplomats were shown craters that the allegedly wayward missiles had created on the surrounding hillsides. Tensions had flared up between India and Pakistan after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based JeM killed 40 CRPF personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14.

 Abhinandan leads the men and machines that taught Pak a lesson | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI/GHAZIABAD: The IAF on Tuesday put the men and their flying machines that bombed on February 26 a Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) facility at Balakot and then thwarted Pakistan's counter-offensive the next day at the forefront of its 87th anniversary on Tuesday, even as Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria said the pre-dawn strikes showed India's resolve to punish perpetrators of terrorism. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was awarded the Vir Chakra for shooting down a much more advanced Pakistani F-16 before his MiG-21 was downed on February 27, led a MiG-21 Bison fighter formation at the flypast to a widely cheering crowd at the Hindon airbase.  Three Mirage-2000 fighters, flanked by two larger Sukhoi-30MKI multi-role jets, then flew the 'Avenger' formation to equally huge applause. Interestingly, the two Sukhois were piloted by Wing Commander K P Singh and Squadron Leader Parshuram, who also flew the fighters during the skirmish between the Indian and Pakistani fighters along the LoC.  This, in effect, demolished Pakistan's claim of having shot down a Sukhoi on that day. To rub it in further, the Mirage-2000s during the flypast were piloted by Group Captain Pranav Raj and Wing Commanders Pankaj Arvind Bhujade and Rahul Basoya, who were awarded the Vayu Sena Medals for successfully striking the JeM facility with Spice-2000 penetration bombs in the early hours of February 26. The IAF chief also awarded unit citations to the Srinagar-based No 51 Squadron of Wing Commander Varthaman and the Gwalior-based No 9 'Wolfpack"" Squadron of Mirage-2000s. The 601 Signal Unit of Squadron Leader Minty Aggarwal, who as a ground-based flight controller showed exceptional alertness to vector the IAF fighters scrambled to intercept the ""strike package"" of intruding Pakistani jets on February 27, also received a unit citation. Squadron Leader Aggarwal has been awarded a Yudh Seva Medal for ""distinguished services"" during wartime. The citation for the No 51 Squadron read, ""The squadron displayed exemplary courage, determination and professional acumen to ensure victory in the aerial engagement, claiming an enemy fighter aircraft in the process, the first instance since the 1971 war..."" ACM Bhadauria said, ""The strategic relevance of this (Balakot strike) is the resolve of the political leadership to punish the perpetrators of terrorism and the IAF capability to execute a strike inside Pakistan. This has been a major shift in the government's way of handling terrorist attacks."" Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"Narendra Modi:  Land, air or space, we had courage to do surgical strikes | - Times of India","MEERUT/RUDRAPUR: In his first election address after the poll schedule was announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack on the opposition by saying that 'if Congress is removed, poverty will disappear.' He also referred to the success of 'Mission Shakti', saying, ""It is this chowkidar's government that had the courage to conduct surgical strikes on land, in air as well as in space."" ""For four generations, the Congress family has harped on their slogans of 'garibi hatao'. The family continued to grow but the poor remained poor. For 72 years, Congress has backstabbed the poor of this country but now I assure you that your chowkidar, your Prime Minister will not rest till poverty is truly alleviated from the country,"" Modi said at a rally in Meerut. Coining a new acronym for the SP-BSP-RLD alliance, and terming it 'Sarab', PM Narendra Modi on Thursday said, ""Take 'sa' from Samajwadi Party, 'ra' from Rashtriya Lok Dal and 'b' from Bahujan Samaj Party, and see what you get? Shouldn't we rescue ourselves from sarab for our good health?"" He added that ""Behenji worked hard for over two decades to put opposition leaders into jail and now she has joined hands with them."" The PM alleged that ""mahamilawat (grand adulteration) leaders are competing with each other as to who will become a hero in Pakistan."" ""They are all over Pakistani media. People are clapping for them. You tell me what does our nation want? A hero of India or of Pakistan?"" Referring to the opposition's demand for proof of the Balakot air strikes, the PM said, ""Kya humein saboot chahiye ya sapoot chahiye? Mere desh ke sapoot hi mere desh ke sabse bada saboot hai.

What do you say about a person who doesn't even know the difference between A-SAT and theatre set?"" Taking a jibe at the Congress's poll promise of transferring Rs 72,000 into the bank accounts of the poor every year, the PM said, ""Those people who could not open bank accounts for the poor in the last 70 years are promising direct transfer of money into their accounts."" In his next poll stop at Rudrapur in Udham Singh Nagar district of Uttarakhand, Modi resumed his tirade against Congress by alleging that the party was responsible for corruption, lack of development and migration from villages of Uttarakhand. The PM started his address by greeting the huge crowd that had gathered at the rally venue 'Modi Maidan' (named after the PM) in Kumaoni. Expressing his gratitude for the enormous gathering, he said that everyone who appeared in the rally was a 'Chowkidar'. He asked people to chant after him and complete the sentence, 'Main bhi........Chowkidar'. ""Devbhomi Uttarakhand has Char Dhams, but today I add a fifth one - Sainik Dham as every second house in this state is that of an Army jawan,"" the PM said, adding that ""attempts are being made by the opposition parties to hurt the morale of defence forces."" The PM also added that over 40,000 houses had been built under PM Awas Yojana in Uttarakhand and ""it is my responsibility to provide homes for the homeless.""

 IAF prepared to fight at short notice: Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force is prepared to fight at ""short notice"" and is fully ready to respond to any terror strike from Pakistan, Chief of Air Staff Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria said on Friday. The IAF chief described as ""new threat"" the dropping of consignments of weapons by drones in border areas of Punjab allegedly by Pakistan-based terror groups and vowed to take ""action"" to deal with incidents of airspace violation. At a press conference, Bhadauria also said IAF is monitoring development of military infrastructure by China along the Tibetan region, noting that it was not an issue of great concern. ""The IAF is prepared to fight at short notice in full synergy with the other two sister services... Our operational preparedness has been of a very high order,"" he said. He said the IAF has achieved a number of operational milestones during the last one year including the strikes on a terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot. ""While we are proud of our past, we do not rest on our past laurels. Our primary focus is to continue to build and maintain effective air power for the future,"" he said. Bhadauria reiterated that India shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter aircraft in the aerial engagement on February 27 while losing a MiG-21. Pakistan has been denying that India shot down one of its F-16 jets. Asked whether the IAF was ready for another Balakot-type strike, the Air Chief Marshal said any terror activity or strike from Pakistan would be responded to according to government's directive. ""Whatever be the targets, they will be taken care off,"" he said. Asked whether Pakistan would be able to block IAF's communication network in future, he said necessary infrastructure has been put in place to ensure safe radio communication. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who downed the Pakistani F-16, could not hear radio messages during the aerial combat on February 27 as the communication was jammed by Pakistan. Minutes later his MiG 21 Bison was hit and he was held captive in Pakistan for three days. ""They will not be able to hear and jam our communication network,"" said the Air Chief. On reports that the terrorist training camp in Balakot has been ""reactivated"", he said, ""If we had not carried out the Balakot strikes, then the level of activities would have been in greater intensity."" When asked about incidents of Pakistani terror groups dropping arms in Punjab border using drones, he said, ""I would not say it is a very serious threat. It is a new threat. It is not something which we had not anticipated. Some measures were taken already to deal with the situation."" ""It is an issue of airspace violation and necessary steps will be taken...Action has been initiated,"" Bhadauria added. On China building helipads and other military infrastructure along the border, he said IAF is monitoring their infrastructure development. ""We are working on our own infrastructure. It is not an issue of some great concern. We know exactly what is happening,"" he added. The IAF Chief said the induction of new generation combat aircraft and lethal precision weapons will provide the force with an overwhelming offensive capability to deter and punish the enemy. ""Our air defence network has also been strengthened by the induction and integration of modern sensors and weapon systems. We are progressively nearing our goal of establishing a robust network centric operations capability,"" he added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"MiG 21 missing: Pakistan used its Air Force to target India's military installations, bid foiled: MEA | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Accusing Pakistan Air Force of targeting Indian military installations, India on Wednesday said the attack was foiled successfully but one MIG fighter jet was shot down in the aerial confrontation and a pilot is ""missing in action"". In a very brief press statement, External affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, accompanied by Air Vice Marshal R G K Kapoor, said details are also being ascertained about Pakistan's claim of having captured one Indian pilot. The fresh confrontation came a day after Indian Air Force launched a counter-terrorism action against a training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Pakistan, based on credible evidence that the UN-proscribed terror group intended to launch terror attacks. The JeM had taken the responsibility of the terror strike in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. Against the Indian counter-terrorism action, ""Pakistan has responded this morning by using its Air Force to target military installations on the Indian side. Due to our high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan's attempts were foiled successfully,"" Kumar said. He said the Pakistan Air Force action was detected and the Indian Air Force responded instantly. ""In that aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side."" ""In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts,"" he said. Both officials did not take any questions from the media. Soon after the Indian statement, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan did a live TV address and favoured talks to resolve the issues between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. He, however, claimed that two Indian MIGs crossed the Line of Control (LoC) and they were shot down. ""Our action was only intended to convey that if you can come into our country, we can do the same. Two of their MiGs were shot down (in the ensuing action),"" Khan said. Noting that all wars are miscalculated, and no one knows where they lead to, Khan said that better sense must prevail and the two sides should act with wisdom. ""I ask India: with the weapons you have and the weapons we have, can we really afford a miscalculation? If this (situation) escalates, it will no longer be in my control or in PM Modi's,"" Khan said. ""Let's sit together and settle this with talks,"" he added. Before the MEA briefing, the Pakistan Army had released a 46-second video showing a blindfolded man claiming that he is IAF's Wing Commander Abhinandan. ""I am an IAF officer. My service No is 27981,"" the man is seen as saying in the video. However, the veracity of the video could not be ascertained. The heightened tension also saw Pakistan shutting down its entire airspace and India closing down civilian air traffic in most of its northern region temporarily.

 PM Modi making irresponsible statements on Balakot air strike: Sharad Pawar | India News - Times of India,"PUNE: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of making ""irresponsible"" statements on the Balakot air strike and said it did not behove the PM's stature. The Indian Air Force (IAF), after the Pulawam Terror attack, carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting a JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The BJP leadership is making ""immature"" statements on the February 26 air strike by the IAF, Pawar said addressing reporters after holding a meeting with NCP workers here. ""The prime minister is making irresponsible statements in connection with the air strike. While we are saying that the issue should not be politicised, the PM is going places and giving statements that the Opposition is politicising the issue,"" the former Union minister said. Pawar said, ""Modi is giving statements like 'he will do this and he will do that', which I feel do not suit the stature of prime minister"". Such statements are not good for the country, he said. Amid BJP's charge that opposition parties are lowering morale of the armed forces by questioning the veracity of the air strike, the NCP chief said he never raised any question over the air force's action. ""I have always said that I have 100 per cent faith in the capabilities of our armed forces. They will never hesitate to give their lives to protect our country,"" he added. Pawar said he had made it clear in the all-party meeting held in the wake of the February 14 Pulwama terror attack that this issue should not be politicised.""I remain firm on my stand,"" he added. Responding to a question about BJP chief Amit Shah's claim of 250 terrorists were killed in the air strike, Pawar said it was an ""immature"" statement. ""I have worked in the defence ministry for some years and I know it very well that people outside the ministry never get such figures. However, the way such numbers are being presented, I feel that these leaders are showing immaturity which is not good for our country,"" he said. PM Modi's recent statement that the presence of Rafale fighters would have given greater firepower to the IAF during the February 26 aerial engagement with Pakistan, was ""uncalled for"", Pawar said. ""While I completely agree that if Rafale (aircraft) is there with the air force, it would have been better for us, however, that does not mean that air force has lesser capabilities. ""Today, we have MiG, we also have Sukhoi (aircraft) which is equally capable. Therefore, there was no need on the part of the prime minister to make such statement,"" he said.

" RSS praises Air Force, Modi govt for air strike in Pakistan | India News - Times of India","GWALIOR: The RSS on Friday lauded the Indian Air Force (IAF) for hitting terror launch pads in Pakistan and also praised the government for taking the decision. This was stated in the organisation's annual report presented on day one of the three-day meeting of the Akhil Bhartiya Pratinidhi Sabha, RSS' highest policy-making body in Gwalior. The RSS lauds the IAF for the air strike and also praises the government for this decision, the report said. ""The government has taken the right decision to deal with the anti-national forces and Indians should also remain cautious of such elements,"" RSS joint general secretary, Manmohan Vaidya told reporters. Around 1,400 members of the Pratinidhi Sabha including RSS head, Mohan Bhagwat and Sarkaryavaha Bhaiyaji Joshi are taking part in the meeting, which will also discuss the Sabrimala temple issue, he said. Vaidya said the Kerala government is working against the spirit of Supreme Court ruling on the shrine by playing with the faith of Hindus and forcing entry of women who are not Hindus in the temple. On the Ram temple issue, he said all those associated with the matter are putting their views in the Supreme Court. ""We have full faith in the judicial system and hope the all obstacles will be cleared and the temple constructed,"" Vaidya said. He said no separate discussion will take place in the meeting on the ensuing Lok Sabha elections, adding the RSS believes that maximum number of people should vote. Participants at the three-day meet will share their ideas and experience on issues like social harmony, environment conservation, saving water, reducing use of plastic and tree plantation, Vaidya said. The number of RSS 'shakhas' (branches/units) increased this year, compared to last year, he said. In 2018, there were 58,967 shakhas and the number now is 59,266, he said.

 Rahul Gandhi should be ashamed of seeking air strike proof: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"SAGAR: BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday said Congress chief Rahul Gandhi should feel ashamed of asking for proof of India's air strike on a terror camp in Pakistan. People will give Rahul Gandhi a reply for (saying) it during the ensuing Lok Sabha polls, the BJP leader said. Addressing the party's booth-level workers at Bamora near Sagar town in Madhya Pradesh, Amit Shah said an IAF official at a press conference asserted that the IAF had hit terror targets. Even after this conclusive statement, Rahul Gandhi is insulting thousands of martyrs of India by asking for evidence of the air strike, Amit Shah said. The IAF conducted air strike last month on a camp of Jaish-e-Muhammed in Pakistan, in retaliation to the terror outfit's attack at Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir in which 40 CRPF personnel were martyred. The BJP chief lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his ""work and untiring attitude."" Earlier ""only two countries"" were known for avenging attack on their forces. ""Modiji has now ensured India's name is also counted among such countries,"" he said. In the last 25 years, Modi has not taken a single vacation, Shah said. He targeted Gandhi for ""going on vacations frequently."" The country has got a prime minister who works for 18 out of 24 hours a day and is very dedicated towards the nation, the BJP chief said. ""What the Modi government has done in 55 months of rule, the Congress was unable to do in 55 years with Gandhi family's four generations ruling the country,"" he said. The Modi government brought a major change in the country by implementing 135 welfare schemes, including Ayushman Bharat, Rs 6,000 per annum for small and marginal farmers and Rs 3,000 pension for labourers, Amit Shah said.

"Masood Azhar: Pakistan arrests 44 members of banned outfits, including Masood Azhar's brother | World News - Times of India","ISLAMABAD: Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar's son and brother were among 44 members of banned terrorist outfits taken into ""preventive detention"", Pakistan said Tuesday, amid mounting pressure from the global community on it to rein in terror groups operating on its soil. ""It was decided (at a meeting) to speed up action against all proscribed groups. In compliance, 44 under observation members of proscribed organisations, including Mufti Adbul Raoof and Hamad Azhar, have been taken in preventive detention for investigation,"" the interior ministry said in a statement. Later at a press conference here, minister of state for interior Shehryar Khan Afridi confirmed that 44 people have been taken into custody as part of crackdown on militant groups. Ministry of interior secretary Azam Suleman Khan said Hamad Azhar and Mufti Abdul Raoof were among those detained. Hamad is the son of Masood Azhar while Raoof is his brother. Khan said a dossier shared by India with Pakistan last week also contained names of Raoof and Hamad. ""It does not mean that action is being taken against only those individuals who are mentioned in the dossier,"" he added. The crackdown came amid tensions with India following a suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14 by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group that killed 40 CRPF soldiers. India last week handed over the dossier to Pakistan to take action against the JeM, as pressure mounted on Islamabad to take action against individual and organisation listed by the UN Security Council as terrorists. Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi last week admitted that the JeM chief is in Pakistan and is ""very unwell"", but said the government can act against him only if India presents ""solid"" and ""inalienable"" evidence that can stand in a court of law. ""He is in Pakistan, according to my information. He is unwell to the extent that he can't leave his house, because he's really unwell,"" Qureshi told CNN in an interview. Afridi, however, said the action was not taken due to any pressure. ""This is our own initiative...We won't allow the use of our soil against any country,"" he said. Interior secretary Khan said the action would be taken against all the proscribed organisations under the National Action Plan, which was formulated after an attack on an army school in Peshawar in 2014 that killed nearly 150 people, mostly children. ""This is across the board - we don't want to give the impression that we are against one organisation,"" he said. He said the crackdown will continue for two weeks and actions against the arrested members will be taken on the basis of evidence. Responding to a question, Khan said Hafiz Saeed-led Jamaat-ud-Dawa and its charity wing Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation would be banned within 24 hours. On February 21, Pakistan government had announced that it had banned the JuD and FIF. However, according to the website of the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NCTA), which was updated on Monday, JuD and FIF are still under watch list. The interior ministry statement also said that a high-level meeting was held on March 4 to implement National Action Plan (NAP). It said that actions against extremists will continue, as per the decisions taken in National Security Committee (NSC). The move came a day after Pakistan on Monday promulgated a law to streamline the procedure for the implementation of the UN sanctions against individuals and organisations. Interpreting the order, Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said the order means that the government has taken over the control of assets and properties of all banned outfits operating in the country. The US last month asked Pakistan to ""freeze without delay"" the funds and other financial assets of the UNSC-designated terrorist networks and their leaders. Pakistan is also under pressure from the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to deliver on its commitments to curb terror financing. The FATF in June last year placed Pakistan onto its watch list in a bid to push the country to halt support for militant groups. In June 2018, Pakistan made a high-level political commitment to work with the FATF and APG to strengthen its Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism AML/CFT regime and to address its strategic counter-terrorism financing-related deficiencies by implementing a 10-point action plan to accomplish these objectives. The successful implementation of the action plan and its physical verification by the APG will lead the FATF to clear Pakistan out of its grey list or else move into the black list by September 2019.

 We hit the intended targets: IAF on Balakot strikes | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force on Thursday said that its air strikes on Jaish-e-Mohammed's training camp in Pakistan's Balakot were successful and managed to destroy the intended targets. Addressing a joint press conference, Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor said there is credible information and evidence to show that the IAF strikes were successful and the military action produced the desired result. Kapoor said it was up to the political leadership to decide when and how to release evidence of the Balakot strike's success. Asked about the number of terrorists killed in the attack, IAF said it is premature to assess the casualties and damage. On Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's announcement to release Wing Commander Abhinandan Vartaman, Kapoor said, ""We are very happy he will be freed tomorrow and look forward to his return."" He, however, dismissed suggestions that it was a goodwill gesture by Pakistan, insisting it was in line with the Geneva Conventions. The IAF pilot was taken into custody by Pakistan after a fierce aerial confrontation yesterday during which a MiG-21 Bison shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet. Kapoor was addressing the media along with the representatives of the Army and the Navy, who said the armed forces are on high alert and ready to meet any security challenge on land and sea.

The sources said the location of the air defence units deployed in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Gujarat and Rajasthan were reviewed by the force and it was felt that a number of them can be moved to forward locations to thwart enemy aerial strikes close to the border itself. India's air defence assets include the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems along with the Russian Kvadrat and other old legacy systems. The force is also set to receive the latest MR-SAM air defence system which has been produced by the DRD-Israel joint venture. After India hit the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot town of Khyber Pakhtunwa province of Pakistan, the neighbouring country launched a big aerial attack in Jammu sector along the Line of Control. Even though the attack was thwarted by the Air Force air defence fighters including the MiG-21s and the Su-30MKIs and one Pakistani F-16 was also shot down, it was felt that presence of air defence units in the area could have caused more damage to the Pakistanis. Due to the aggressive response of the Air Force, the Pakistanis could come only a couple of kilometres inside the Indian territory. The Pakistani air attack on February 27 was in response to the Balakot hits by the Indian Air Force a day earlier. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Amit Shah is calling the forces liar, the nation won't tolerate this: Arvind Kejriwal on air strike deaths | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said BJP president Amit Shah took a stand contradictory to that of the armed forces over the number of terrorists killed in the pre-dawn air strikes on terror group Jaish-e-Muhammed's training camps in Pakistan. On Sunday, Shah said the air strikes killed more than 250 terrorists, while the armed forces have not put out any official figure. ""The armed forces are also saying this. Amit Shah is saying that the armed forces are lying, 250 (terrorists) were killed. Amit Shah is calling the armed forces a liar. The country will not tolerate this under any circumstances,"" Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi, referring to a news report which quotes union minister SS Ahluwalia as saying that the purpose of the strike was to send a message and not to kill. क्या अमित शाह के मुताबिक़ सेना झूठ बोल रही है? सेना ने साफ़ साफ़ कहा है कि कोई मरा या नहीं मरा या कितने मरे, ये न… https://t.co/KecSS8FLq3— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) 1551674799000In another tweet, the Delhi chief minister said the whole country stands with the armed forces while the BJP stands against them. ""The armed forces cannot lie but the BJP is lying. The whole country stands with the armed forces but BJP stands against them,"" Kejriwal said. At an event in Ahmedabad, Shah had said: ""After Pulwama attack, everyone was thinking that we can't do surgical strike so what will happen. But the Narendra Modi government, on the 13th day (after the attack), conducted air strikes and killed more than 250 terrorists."" At a press conference this morning, IAF chief B S Dhanoa declined to comment on the death toll in the Balakot strike, saying it was for the government to provide details on the number of terrorists killed. ""We don't count human casualties. We count what targets we have hit or not hit,"" he said. The bomb damage assessment that is done post a mission only calculates the target that has been hit or not hit, the air chief noted. ""We can't count how many people have died. That depends on how many people were there,"" Dhanoa said, adding that a statement on the number of terrorists killed will be made by the government.

 I witnessed Wing Commander Abhinandan shooting down Pak's F-16 aircraft: Squadron Leader Minty Agarwal | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Indian Air Force (IAF) Squadron Leader Minty Agarwal, the first woman who has been awarded the Yudh Seva Medal, on Thursday said that she witnessed Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman shooting down a Pakistani F-16 fighter aircraft during a dogfight on February 27, a day after the Balakot airstrike. Agarwal became the first defence officer to get Yudh Seva Medal, which is awarded to recognise distinguished service of a high order during war, conflict or hostilities. ""From the time Wing Commander Abhinandan became airborne, I was the one who was providing him with the air situation picture. I saw the fading of F-16 blip from my screen,"" she told ANI here, adding that he had launched the offensive on the enemy aircraft at the most appropriate time. Recounting the chain of events of the two operations, the officer said after conducting the Balakot airstrike successfully, the IAF was expecting a retaliation by the enemy, which ultimately came. ""We carried out the strike over non-military camps (in Balakot) very successfully. We were expecting retaliation from the enemy. All of us were extra ready. They retaliated within 24 hours. Initially, there were only a few (Pakistani) aircraft but slowly the density of aircraft increased,"" she said. She also said that Pakistani aircraft had entered the Indian skies with an intention to inflict harm as against the neighbour's claims that the action was to show its capability and will to respond. ""They had come with an intention to carry out any operation but due to the competency of our pilots, controllers and our team, their whole mission was thwarted,"" she added.

Modi insulted my family but I won't insult his: Rahul Gandhi - Times of India,"UJJAIN: Congress president Rahul Gandhi Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi insulted his father and grandmother during the ongoing election campaign but he will never speak ill of the latter's parents. Addressing a rally ahead of the fourth and last phase of Lok Sabha polls in Madhya Pradesh, Gandhi also said Modi should stop talking about ""clouds and mangoes"" and tell people about issues which matter. He the Congress would defeat Modi ""with love"". ""Modi ji talks with hatred. He insults my father, grandmother, great grandfather. But I will never in my life speak about his family, his mother and father. I will die, but will never insult his mother and father. ""This is because I am not a RSS or BJP man, but belong to the Congress. I will return him love if hatred is thrown at me...We will defeat Modi ji with love, hugging you,"" he said. The Congress president was apparently referring to the prime minister's statements made in two interviews: to a news channel and another to Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar. ""Modi ji talks with hatred...he insulted my father, grandmother and great grandfather...I will die, but not insult Modi ji's mother and father,"" he said. Gandhi said Modi talked about cloud cover ""helping"" IAF planes evade Pakistani radars during the Balakot air strikes and about climbing trees and eating mangoes. ""Clouds and mangoes are being talked about, but nothing is being said on the issues which matter,"" he said. Gandhi targeted Modi on the Rafale deal, adding the ""chowkidar"" committed theft in it and hence is unable to speak about corruption. ""Modi ji will not be able to show his face to India if he debates the issue with me,"" he added. Gandhi called MP chief minister Kamal Nath to read out the name of two family members of ex-CM and BJP vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan whose agriculture loans were waived. ""We waived loans of even family members of Shivraj ji and he lying that farmers' loans were not waived. We waived loans of thousands of BJP workers with love.

 Govt rejected IAF proposal to strike Pakistan after 26/11: BS Dhanoa | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: Former IAF chief BS Dhanoa said on Friday the government had rejected a proposal of the air force to strike Pakistani terrorist camps after 26/11. He made the statement while addressing a big gathering of students, among others, at VJTI’s annual festival, Technovanza. “We knew where the terror camps were located in Pakistan and were ready. But it is a political decision whether to carry out a strike or not,’’ he said. Dhanoa was the air chief between December 31, 2016, and September 30, 2019. He said after the attack on Parliament in December 2001, the IAF had proposed punitive action against Pakistan through air strikes. “This was not accepted. Pakistan owes its exalted position in society to its propogation of threat from India,” Dhanoa said. Bajwa assured me Pak army 'ready for India': ImranSaying “if peace were to come, Pakistan would lose several of its privileges’’, former IAF chief Dhanoa emphasised that Islamabad would keep the Kashmir “pot” boiling without allowing it to boil over. According to him, Pakistan indulges in propaganda battles and will continue to attack. “The IAF has the ability to fight short, swift wars tomorrow, and any future war will be on land, air, sea and space,’’ he said. Balakot message was to tell Pak there will be cost for terror attacks: Former Air Chief MarshalAccording to Dhanoa, one of the major challenges faced by India is the fact that it has two nuclear-armed nations in its neighbourhood. Though he chose not to identify the countries, he was obviously referring to China and Pakistan. In a question-answer session later, Dhanoa said while India had nuclear capability on land, and in the sea and air, China had developed a modern air force which relies on quality not quantity. “There has been a significant increase in the deployment of aircraft and air crew in the Tibet Autonomous Region from other military regions as well. It is busy on the eastern front and the South China Sea. They have created unsinkable aircraft carriers,’’ he said, adding, “When I met the Chinese air force chief at the Aero India 2019 in Bengalaru, I said ‘we must meet more on the ground than in the air’,’’ Dhanoa said. On the February 26, 2019, Balakot air strike, he said it created a shock effect in Pakistan and the Pakistan Air Force was caught unawares. “There is lack of joint planning among its defence forces and their morale is low.” He said in the IAF, the Mirage 2000, the Mig-29 and Jaguars had been upgraded and future radars would be indigenous. “While fighting with low tech weapons, there will be a lot of casualties. You do not have the luxury of time. Start indigenisation from low to medium capability and then to high technology.’’ Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
How Pakistani media reacted to IAF strike in Balakot - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A few hours after the air strike by the Indian Air Force on Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camps in Balakot inside Pakistan, the neighbouring country’s media has quoted authorities and ministers to state that they are fully prepared to respond to the situation. Refuting India's statement that a large number of JeM terrorists were killed in the IAF operations early on Tuesday, the Dawn claimed that there were no damages or casualties in the attack. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said a large number of JeM terrorists were killed. The Dawn quoted Balakot police chief Saghir Hussain Shah as saying that he had sent teams to the site which was mostly a ""deserted wooded area: and found ""no casualties or damages on the ground because of the dropping of the bombs”. To Gokhale’s statement that the terror facility at Balakot was headed by Maulana Yousuf Azhar (alias Ustad Ghouri), the brother-in-law of JeM chief Masood Azhar, the newspaper said he did not provide any evidence. The Express Tribune extensively quoted Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s statement that IAF action was a “violation of the Line of Control (LoC)”. He said Pakistan reserved the right to respond to the IAF fighter jets’ air strike. “We have fought a successful war against terrorism… We are a peace-loving nation and are aware of the consequences of terrorism,” the foreign minister further said. The Express Tribune said Qureshi lauded the armed forces for their prompt reply to “Indian aggression” and said that “the defenders of the nation are awake, and the nation has nothing to worry about”. The Daily Times focused on the meeting of Pakistani Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Chief of Air Staff Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan. After the meeting, it said, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released a statement that Pakistani armed forces were fully prepared to give a befitting response to any Indian “aggression or misadventure”. According to The Express Tribune, the two top military officers deliberated upon the operational environment in the region including “threat and response” in the meeting. The joint statement came a day after Bajwa and Khan had released separate but synonymous remarks about Pakistan’s complete preparedness against any aggression.

Congress responsible for lowering political discourse: Rajnath Singh - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: As the bitter Lok Sabha poll campaign heads to a close this week, Union home minister Rajnath Singh has accused the Congress of being responsible for lowering the political discourse, saying never before has the chief of the main opposition party hurled abuses like ' Chowkidar chor hai' at the prime minister. Singh also predicted that the BJP will get a majority on its own and that the party-headed National Democratic Alliance (NDA) can well end up with a two-third majority. He claimed there is a ""wave"" in favour of the BJP in West Bengal and it could win 30 of the 42 seats at stake in the TMC-ruled state. On the prospects of him emerging as a consensus candidate for prime ministership to get the support of regional parties for a majority if the NDA falls short of the magic number of 272, Singh said this question does not arise. The 67-year-old BJP stalwart said he has never sought any post and that he will always abide by the decision of the party. Asserting there is no question of anyone being the prime minister other than Narendra Modi, Singh said, ""Modiji is young, energetic, visionary, dynamic so there is no question of any successor for him."" The seven-phase marathon elections concludes on May 19. Stating there is a need for political parties to maintain high standards of poll campaign, Singh accused Congress President Rahul Gandhi of stooping low during the poll campaign and lowering the dignity of the office of the prime minister. ""Never before has the prime minister been called names by a president of a national party. ' Chowkidar chor hai' slogan was given by Gandhi. This was wrong as prime minister is a prime minister after all,"" Singh told PTI in an interview on Sunday. When reminded about sloganeering against Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi when they were prime ministers, Singh said, ""it must be a slogan by an ordinary party worker and never by a party president of any national party."" Singh sidestepped questions on the accusations by the Congress that it was Modi who lowered the political discourse. ""President or Prime Minister are not any individuals. They are an institutions in itself and in democracy we should ensure that the dignity of the institutions is not lowered. This should be a cause of concern for everyone as otherwise democracy in the country will weaken,"" he said. ""Congress should not have stooped so low by abusing the prime minister."" Singh, a former BJP president and Uttar Pradesh chief minister, said the BJP was on course to retain power with a comfortable majority and could increase its 2014 tally of 282. The strength of the BJP-led NDA in the outgoing Lok Sabha is 337. Unfazed by the alliance of arch rivals Samajwadi Party(SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party(BSP) in Uttar Pradesh, Singh feels it will not hurt the prospects of the BJP and that it will win around the same number as in 2014.The NDA won 73 out of the 80 seats at stake in this politically crucial state with the BJP accounting for 71. Singh said people can see through the motive of the alliance between the SP and BSP. ""Both the parties have enjoyed power in UP for long and they have no credibility among the masses. People are aware that this coalition is only limited to stop the Modi juggernaut,"" he said. He said after the formation of this alliance, the credibility of the BSP and the SP has gone further down. ""Anything which has been done with a negative mindset will not yield any positive results...the alliance myth will be shattered on the day of results"". About the impact of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh politics, Singh said ""let us not talk about this because Congress has no prospect at all"". Asked whether the BJP will enlist the support of regional parties like the TRS or YSR Congress or BJD, Singh, who entered politics in 1977, sought to use the concept of atom in his response. Singh, a former Physics teacher, said the BJP-led NDA was the nucleus -- dense central core of the atom -- and does not require any electrons, which are outside the nucleus. He, however, hastened to add that the BJP was always happy in maintaining good relations with anyone. Singh also claimed that the BJP will throw a surprise in West Bengal winning a majority of seats. ""There is a wave in West Bengal and our tally can go up to a maximum of 30 seats,"" he said. The BJP currently has 2 seats. To a question about the BJP hyping ultra nationalism in the poll campaign in the backdrop of the Balakot air strikes, Singh made it clear that his party was committed to ensure that issues relating to armed forces will never be a poll issue. ""But at times our soldiers have done some exemplary work, praising their hardwork is not a crime. We have done it in the past and we will do it in future. We are not doing it during elections only"". To a question on what is wrong if Congress chose to praise soldiers and not Modi for the Balakot operation, he countered, ""If Indira Gandhi was credited for the 1971 victory in the war with Pakistan, why can't Modi be given credit for carrying out a successful anti-terror operation on the soil of Pakistan."" ""Atal Bihari Vajpayee has often praised Indira Gandhi especially after the victory of 1971. The present opposition should have a large heart like Atalji,"" he said. On the likely outcome for the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls, Singh gave a sarcastic response. ""It is a constant worry for us even in this Lok Sabha too we may not have a leader of opposition. But I wish them best of luck for the next polls."" The Congress bagged only 44 seats in the 2014 polls to emerge as the single largest opposition party but could not stake claim for the status of Leader of the Opposition(LoP) in the Lower House as at least 10 per cent of the total strength of the House (55 seats) is required.

IAF air strikes in Balakot: Indian message aimed at Pakistan military-intelligence complex - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The air strikes against terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed’s biggest camp in Balakot, after the 2016 surgical strikes, have created greater strategic spaces for India in dealing with the terrorist threat emanating from Pakistan. During the 2016 surgical strikes after Uri, India showed that it no longer considered the LoC sacrosanct, that they could cross over to strike terror launch pads in PoK. PoK is a territory India claims for itself, so targets there were deemed legitimate retaliation for terror provocation. In 2019, this argument has been taken to the next level. India’s air strikes today reached deep inside Pakistan, into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, beyond PoK. They went straight to the heart of the Jaish-e-Mohammed’s training facility. The number of terrorists killed is not the most important issue today. JeM has the ability and the wherewithal to raise more armies of jihadis. Despite the ostensible target being a terrorist training camp, the Indian message was aimed elsewhere, at the Pakistan military-intelligence complex, which is the prime sponsor of Pakistani terrorism. The message reinforced what had been conveyed by the 2016 surgical strikes, that India would make the much-touted nuclear threshold a “variable” rather than a “constant.” Pakistan used the fear of the nuclear threshold to launch the Kargil conflict in 1999. That supposed threshold became a tool to psyche India into not retaliating against more lethal terror attacks, including 26/11, the worst of them all. Pakistan uses terror groups as strategic assets, elements of coercive power to leverage religious sentiment for essentially a political war. As one top-level Indian functionary explained, India and Pakistan fell into a cycle of terror and talks – “like the left hand washing the right hand the vice versa.” With the Uri surgical strikes, India inserted a note of uncertainty into the Pakistani calculation, that Indian retaliation too became an option, which raised costs and vulnerability for Pakistan. With the Balakot strikes today, that uncertainty has taken a harder role. So far, Pakistan was writing the rules of the game – they have used terror groups to violate the LOC every time, which Indian forces were bound by them. India has been in a reactive mode for years. With the Balakot strikes, India is slowly retaking the advantage. By using conventional military tools to target a proxy war, India is signalling that it will not be bound by Pakistan's rules. Therefore, one of the most important terms in the government’s statement today was “pre-emptive”. Today, it was used by the government to explain the strikes which were done on the basis of intelligence that more suicide attacks were being planned against India. Pre-emptive strikes may have been made popular by George W. Bush, but there is a legal justification for such strikes in international law. After today, India can use this precedent to launch more pre-emptive strikes in the future. While today’s strikes were clearly in response to the Pulwama attack, there is space now for future governments to undertake such strikes in anticipation of attacks. That will have implications for Pakistan's military calculations vis a vis India. Before the strikes, India played an exhaustive diplomatic routine – the US was the first to say India had the right of self-defense. In the past week, India received endorsement of its stand from key international partners. The US president was briefed on New Delhi’s thinking, and on Tuesday, Sushma Swaraj spoke to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo to brief him on the strikes. She travels to China this evening and will use the RIC foreign ministers’ conference to justify the strikes. Saleh, former spy chief of Afghanistan said, “Today India ended her practice of strategic patience & IAF conducted precision strikes inside Pakistan territory. Does it mean the coin of covert terrorism will be paid in the coin of overt force? The former satisfies ghosts the latter strengthens confidence in a nation state.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
"IAF strikes Pakistan latest news: 5-star Balakot camp was sitting duck target for IAF, 350 terrorists killed while sleeping: Sources | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Hundreds of terrorists and their trainers were shifted from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to a five-star, resort style camp in a hilltop forest in Balakot after the Pulwama attack, providing Indian forces with ""a sitting duck target"" when they carried out an   air strike early Tuesday   , killing up to 350 terrorists, sources said. They said at least 325 terrorists and 25 to 27 trainers were at the camp, the biggest operated by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad group, which had claimed responsibility for the   February 14 suicide attack   on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Kashmir that killed 40 jawans. Everyone at the camp was sleeping and Pakistani defence establishment had no clue that the attack was coming so deep into their country because they had expected a surgical strike on camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir near the Line of Control, said the sources. How Pakistani media reacted to IAF strike in BalakotBut India received intelligence that JeM had shifted many in-training terrorists and hardcore operatives, along with their trainers, to the Balakot camp, which has facilities for 500 to 700 people, and even has a swimming pool along with cooks and cleaners. Fighter and other aircraft took off from several air bases in Western and Central commands at about the same time, leaving Pakistani defence officials confused as to where they were heading, the sources said. A small group of aircraft broke away from the swarm and headed to Balakot where ""the sleeping terrorists were sitting ducks for the Indian bombing,"" said one source. ""They had no idea that Balakot was to be the target ... when the pictures come in you will see only khandhar (ruins) of the once-flourishing camp"", said the source. The terror camp is located 20 kilometres from Balakot town. Balakot is some 80km from the Line of Control near Abbotabad where al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was killed in hiding by covert US forces who had also sneaked into Pakistan to carry out the operation, catching the entire Pakistani military unawares.

Pakistan registers FIR against IAF pilots for bombing trees: Report - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday lodged a FIR against ""unidentified pilots"" of the Indian Air Force (IAF) for bombing and destroying 19 trees in the Balakot area, according to a media report, days after New Delhi launched a preemptive strike against the Jaish-e-Muhammed's largest training camp in the country. The FIR was filed by the forestry department on Friday against pilots of the Indian Air Force (IAF) for bombing and destroying trees in the Balakot area, the Express News reported. The FIR, registered against ""unidentified IAF pilots"", also details the damage suffered by 19 trees after the Indian fighter jets ""hastily dropped their payload"", it says. On March 26, India said IAF jets, in the face of imminent danger, launched a preemptive strike on Balakot in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. ""In an intelligence led operation in the early hours of today, India struck the biggest training camp of JeM in Balakot. In this operation, a very large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis who were being trained for fidayeen action were eliminated,"" foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said in a statement in New Delhi. He said the JeM facility at Balakot was headed by Maulana Yousuf Azhar, the brother-in-law of Masood Azhar, the chief of JeM. The Express News report said Pakistan also plans to lodge a complaint against India at the United Nations, accusing New Delhi of ""eco-terrorism"". The Indian warplanes bombed Jabba top, a hilly forest area near the northern town of Balakot, about 40km from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Pakistan's climate change minister Malik Amin Aslam had said Indian jets bombed a ""forest reserve"" and the government was undertaking an environmental impact assessment, which will be the basis of a complaint at the United Nations and other forums, the report said. ""What happened over there is environmental terrorism,"" Aslam said, adding that dozens of pine trees had been felled. ""There has been serious environmental damage,"" Aslam was quoted as saying. The United Nations states that ""destruction of the environment, not justified by military necessity and carried out wantonly, is clearly contrary to existing international law"", the report quoted the UN general assembly resolution 47/37 as saying.

Delhi: A pre-emptive strike at pollution hotspots | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: To bolster the capital’s fight against air pollution, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) has started identifying pollution hotspots in the national capital region (NCR) three days in advance on the basis of PM2.5 predictions. Till Monday, these were Mangolpuri, Shalimar Bagh, Azadpur, Jasola and Jat Khor in Delhi and Sahibabad, Jhandapur, Mohannagar and Noida’s Sector 56 in the rest of NCR. From Tuesday, the problem areas will be Shalimar Bagh, Vinobapuri, Kakrola, Jat Khor, Mangolpuri and Kundli. The hotspots are calculated with the help of 3D weather chemistry and emission sources. Track the pollution level in your citySAFAR, under the Union earth sciences ministry, had last year developed an ultra-high-resolution emission inventory for Delhi, which took into account 26 sources and concluded that the transport sector contributed the most — 41% — in the total particulate matter concentration in NCR. The industrial sector has been found to be the second most dominating factor contributing 22.3%. The shares from power and biofuel sectors, re-suspended dust and others are found to be 3%, 5.7%, 18% and 11.7%, respectively. “The emission inventory, along with weather forecasts of every one square km area in the region, gives a forecast for hotspots every three days, which remains valid for almost a week. This gives us the weekly hotspots and mitigation measures can be taken accordingly in these areas,” a SAFAR official told TOI. Last year, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had put up a list of hotspots in NCR. Those in Delhi are Okhla Phase-2, Narela, Bawana, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Dwarka, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, RK Puram, Jahangirpuri and Ashok Vihar. In the rest of NCR, the key areas are Sector 16A Faridabad, Vikas Sadan, Gurugram, Haryana, Vasundhara in Ghaziabad, Knowledge Park-III in Greater Noida’s Sector 125, and RIICO Industrial Area III in Bhiwadi. Various agencies have stepped up action in these areas to curb pollution. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court gave Delhi government seven days to fix the 13 spots identified as the most polluted in the capital. “If you do not solve it in seven days, then you are out,” the court had told the Delhi chief secretary, indicating it would not tolerate inaction.

Sharad Pawar on Rafale Deal:   NCP chief Sharad Pawar targets PM Modi over stolen Rafale documents | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday termed as ""shocking"" the Centre's statement that documents related to the Rafale fighter jet deal have been stolen from the defence ministry, and wondered what will then be the country's situation on the security front. He said it was now obvious the deal was done for the ""benefit of some people"" and sought to know why the government hid the theft from Parliament. He also accused PM Modi of politicising the Indian Air Force's (IAF) air strikes on Jaish-e-Mohammed's camp in Pakistan in retaliation to the terror outfit's attack at Pulwama in Kashmir where 40 CRPF personnel were killed last month. The Centre told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that documents related to the Rafale aircraft deal being stolen, prompting the opposition parties to again raise questions over the Rs 58,000-crore defence deal which is already mired in controversy. ""If confidential papers are stolen, then what will be the situation on the security front,"" Pawar wondered while interacting with NCP workers in Kolhapur through video-conferencing. ""How can confidential papers go missing from the ministry of defence. It is clear now that the Rafale deal was done to benefit some people. Why did the government hide the theft from Parliament. The papers definitely had some important information,"" he said. Terming the government's stand on Rafale deal issue as surprising, he said, ""These are the same people who are refusing an inquiry into the deal while having demanded a probe into the Bofors case."" Taking a swipe at the prime minister's earlier remark ""na khaoonga na khane doonga"" (would not take bribes, nor let anyone do so), Pawar alleged that during PM Modi government's rule, the Rafale aircraft cost was increased. ""The contract was taken away from HAL and given to a new company of industrialist Anil Ambani which had no experience in aircraft manufacturing,"" he further charged. The government and Ambani have, however, been denying any wrongdoing. Further hitting out at PM Modi over IAF's air strikes in Pakistan, Pawar said, ""It is not the opposition, but PM Modi politicising the situation, and that's sad."" India wanted peaceful and friendly relations with all neighbours, including Pakistan. ""But Pakistan's intentions are not similar,"" he said. Even the families of martyrs are saying sacrifices of soldiers should not be politicised, he added. Pawar also claimed that during the recent all-party meeting over the issue, the BJP did not have a representative. Criticising the BJP-led government over its demonetisation, he claimed around 15 lakh people lost their jobs due to the note ban decision. There is no record of how much black money was unearthed, but people had to face lot of hardships, he said. Pawar also claimed that in the last two-and-a-half years, ""11,000 farmers have committed suicide"". He acknowledged the role of social media and said it played a ""very important role"" in BJP's victory in 2014. Referring to the Congress-NCP alliance in Maharashtra, Pawar said two joint rallies have taken place so far and discussions are underway for a couple of seats. ""Talks are on for one or two seats. A decision on who will contest those one or two seats will be taken on merits. There will be no issues. By the time elections are announced, seat-sharing formula will be finalised,"" he said.

Pak navy claims it thwarted Indian submarine from entering its waters - Times of India,"KARACHI: The Pakistan navy Tuesday claimed it had thwarted an attempt by an Indian submarine to enter the country's territorial waters. The report comes after tensions flared up between the two nuclear-armed neighbours following a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. Pakistan Navy also shared a footage with the media, which it said was ""actual"". The image showed that footage was made at 20.35 hours on March 4. ""The Pakistan Navy used its specialised skills to ward off the submarine, successfully keeping it from entering Pakistani waters,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. The Indian submarine was not deliberately targeted by the Pakistan to give peace a chance, the spokesperson said. ""The Indian submarine was not targeted keeping in view Pakistan's policy of peace,"" the official said, adding that India must learn from this incident and ""move towards peace"". ""The Pakistan Navy is always ready to guard its territorial waters and is capable of responding to any kind of aggression with full force,"" the navy said. The naval forces claimed it was the second attempt since November 2016 that naval forces have caught the Indian Navy trying to enter the country's territorial waters. Earlier in 2016, the Pakistan Navy successfully repelled an Indian submarine from entering the country's territorial waters, the report said. After the Pulwama attack, the Indian Air Force carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting what it said was a JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The next day, Pakistan air force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 and captured its pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman who was handed over to India on Friday.

" UK minister holds talks with Sushma Swaraj, Shah Mehmood Qureshi | India News - Times of India","LONDON: Britain's foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday held talks with External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and her Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi to prevent a further escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours following the Pulwama attack. Tensions between India and Pakistan rose following the February 14 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district in which 40 CRPF soldiers were killed. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group claimed responsibility for the attack. Following the incident, India bombed and destroyed JeM's biggest training camp in Balakot in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 80-km from the Line of Control (LoC) early Tuesday, killing a ""very large number"" of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders. On Wednesday, Pakistan claimed it shot down two Indian fighter jets over Pakistani air space and arrested a pilot. ""I've been in touch with foreign minister Swaraj of India and foreign minister Qureshi of Pakistan. I have spoken to both of them about the situation. We are urging restraint on all sides,"" Hunt said in a statement issued by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). ""The UK is very concerned about rising tensions in Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Both countries are good friends of the UK,"" he said. ""Neither side wants to see this escalate further but this is going to take really critical restraint in the days ahead and we are doing everything we can to support the de-escalation of the tensions that are happening at the moment,"" Hunt said. The latest development follows a lengthy discussion on the ""security and humanitarian situation in Kashmir"" in the UK Parliament earlier on Wednesday. British Prime Minister Theresa May had informed MPs in the House of Commons that the UK remained in regular contact with both countries and was working towards de-escalating tensions. One of her other ministers in the FCO Mark Field told Parliament that he will be in India on a three-day pre-scheduled visit from Thursday where he will carry on the UK's efforts to encourage dialogue between India and Pakistan. India launched a major diplomatic offensive against Pakistan after the Pulwama attack and highlighted Pakistan's role in using terrorism as an instrument of state policy. The international community led by the US pressed Pakistan to deny safe haven to terror groups operating form its soil and bring the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack to justice. India has asked Pakistan to take immediate and verifiable action against terrorists and terror groups operating from territories under its control. New Delhi also announced the withdrawal of the Most Favoured Nation status for Pakistan and hiked the customs duty by 200 per cent on goods originating from Pakistan.

 Indian Army postpones five-day recruitment drive in Jammu&amp; Kashmir's Samba district | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: Amid the escalating Indo-Pak tension, the Indian Army on Thursday postponed its five-day recruitment drive in Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir. The Army's recruitment drive was scheduled to be held in Samba from Friday. ""The recruitment rally of 157 infantry battalion (Territorial Army - Home and Hearth), which was scheduled from March 1 to March 5 at Bari Brahmana military garrison has been postponed,"" a defence spokesperson said. He said fresh dates would be announced later. The decision to defer the recruitment drive came two days after Indian fighter jets, in a pre-dawn, preemptive, non-military operation on Tuesday pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammad terror facility at Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan in reply to the outfit's February 14 terror strike in Pulwama in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. In reply to the IAF's strikes, Pakistani fighter jets on Wednesday intruded into Indian airspace to target military installations, but their bid was foiled by IAF jets, which shot down a PAF plane. In the aerial skirmishes, however, India too lost one of its jets and its pilot, who bailed out of the damaged plane and landed in Pakistan, was held in captivity by Pakistan Army's five-day recruitment drive in Samba postponed.

"Narendra Modi:  After first two split calls, EC gives PM Modi 4th unanimous nod - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday got yet another clean chit from the Election Commission, the sixth so far, in a complaint relating to his speech in Patan (Gujarat) on April 21, where he had spoken of how his government had kept Pakistan on its toes to ensure the safety of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman in the wake of the Balakot air strikes. Based on a detailed report received from the Gujarat chief electoral officer and after examining the matter in accordance with the provisions of model code of conduct, the commission said it was of the view that ""no such violation of the extant advisories/provisions is attracted"". The decision to give an all-clear to Modi on his Patan remarks was unanimous, unlike its clean chit on his two speeches at Wardha and Latur, as well as the one that was extended to BJP chief Amit Shah over his comment on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's decision to contest from Wayanad. Shah had said it was difficult to make out if Wayanad is in India or Pakistan. One of the election commissioners while considering the PM's remarks at Wardha and Latur put forth a dissenting view. One of the election commissioners had, while considering the Prime Minister's remarks on ""majority in a minority"" at Wardha and appeal to first-time voters in Latur invoking Balakot strikes and Shah's Nagpur speech, put forth a dissenting view that prime facie violations of the model code and March 19 advisory of the commission on defence forces were made out. TOI has learnt that the dissent was recorded on the file in all three cases. The dissent within the Election Commission on clean chits given to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah on Saturday led senior Congress leader P Chidambaram to comment that the election commission was ""finally showing some signs of life"". ""Closer to May 6, 12 and 19, the election commission may actually reprimand Mr Modi and Mr Shah. That means the fear of Modi-Shah is finally weakening,"" he tweeted. The commission meeting on Saturday was attended by chief election commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora and election commissioner Sushil Chandra while election commissioner Ashok Lavasa was on leave. According to a source in the commission, it is not unusual for the three commissioners to air different views while deliberating on a complaint relating to violation of the poll code or its instructions. For instance, it is learnt that there was some debate on the punishment to be handed out in a case relating to abusive remarks made by Gujarat Congress leader Babubhai Rayka in a speech in Salabatpura on April 11. There were initial suggestions that he be barred from campaigning for the rest of the election, but ultimately, it was decided to limit the ban to three days, it being his first violation. ""Since all members in the commission enjoy equal say and status, the majority view prevails. In the cases relating to Wardha and Latur speeches of Prime Minister and Nagpur remarks by Amit Shah, no formal order was issued and only the election commission's reply sent to the respective complainants based on the majority view within the poll panel,"" said an election commission official.

"IAF air strikes: Pakistan military plays it down, but govt calls it ‘grave aggression’ | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s response to the Indian air strikes vacillated between initially admitting that Indian Air Force (IAF) had ``under forced hasty withdrawal’’ dropped payload near Balakot (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) after Pakistan Air Force scrambled to later rejecting altogether that there was an attack at any ``alleged terrorist camp’’ even near Balakot. Throughout the day Pakistan seemed unsure if there was any attack in Balakot. Pakistan’s armed forces spokesperson Asif Ghafoor in his media briefing, and well after Pakistan PMO had denied there was an attack near Balakot, finally admitted that a payload was dropped at the same place in the KPK province. In this change of narrative every few hours, government officials here said there was a sign of civilian-military disconnect. According to Indian government sources, even though this wasn’t officially stated by India, the JeM terrorist camp hit by IAF was located at Balakot in KPK province. While Pakistan armed forces spokesperson Asif Ghafoor admitted in a tweet in the morning that IAF had violated LoC and dropped payload near Balakot, the narrative seemed to have changed later in the day. Ghafoor tweeted hours later that Indian aircraft ``intrusion across LoC in Muzaffarabad Sector within AJ&K (what Pakistan calls Azad Jammu and Kashmir) was 3-4 miles’’. ``Under forced hasty withdrawal aircrafts released payload which had free fall in open area. No infrastructure got hit, no casualties. Technical details and other important information to follow,’’ he said. There was no mention of Balakot in this tweet. According to a statement by Pakistan PMO, Pakistan’s National Security Committee too later ""strongly rejected Indian claim of targeting an alleged terrorist camp near Balakot and the claim of heavy casualties’’. This was even as it described the air strikes as uncalled for aggression and declared that Pakistan was going to respond to it. ``Once again Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim,’’ it said. Just when it seemed that Pakistan had it sorted out, Ghafoor in his media briefing, while declaring that Pakistan was going to respond at a time and point of its choosing, again said that the payload had fallen indeed in Balakot (KP). Balakot in KP, where the strike took place according to India, is about 50 miles from LoC, and different from the Balakot village in the Poonch sector along the LoC. Balakot along the LoC is also not known to be the home of any major JeM training camp, according to Indian officials. Pakistan’s shifting position on Balakot, government sources here said, could be meant to ward off pressure to militarily respond to Indian strikes immediately. ``They would be under a lot more pressure to respond quickly if they admitted that the strikes were deep inside Pakistan and not just along the LoC,’’ said an official. Pakistan had been claiming for days that its air force was in a state of high alert. Pakistan PM Imran Khan too had declared a few days ago that if India attacked Pakistan, Islamabad would not think twice about retaliating.

Addressing a rally in Gosaiganj, about 25 km from this temple town, the prime minister said his is the only government that thinks of the poor. ""Behenji (Mayawati) used Babasaheb Ambedkar's name but acted against his ideals. In the same way, the SP took Lohia's name at every step but sullied the image of the socialist leader,"" he said.

" The old order changes, yields place to Savarkar | India News - Times of India","By wholeheartedly endorsing his party's idea of giving Vinayak Damodar Savarkar or Veer Savarkar the country's top civilian honour, PM Narendra Modi has made absolutely clear his - and his government's - resolve to replace the Nehruvian idea of India with that of the Hindutva icon. Does that mean the end of secularism or equal respect for all faiths, that long-cherished ideal of the Indian republic? Well, the opposition or the dominant ""liberal-secular"" commentators would say it does. But their contention is vigorously disputed by the BJP and Savarkar's other admirers, who say that it actually signifies the collapse of pseudo-secularism and the advent of genuine reverence for all religions as gainst the cruel and rather unfunny caricature that the term ""sarva dharma samabhav"" has been reduced to. And it has Savarkar to quote for it. At length. After he became leader of the Hindu Mahasabha in 1937 and began explaining at mass rallies his theory of Hindutva, Savarkar was asked if a Hindu Rashtra, as conceived by him, meant Muslims would be reduced to the status of second-class citizens. No, he said, it meant simply that ""pseudo-secularism and Muslim appeasement"" - both terms later popularized by LK Advani in the 1980s and 1990s - would have no place in the new India. The one-time revolutionary who had spent a decade in solitary confinement in the Cellular Jail on the Andaman Islands - the worst prison or Guantanamo Bay of the early 1900s -- was categorical that Hindus would not have any special position in the Hindu Rashtra; instead, ""one vote (per person) and one law"" would be the regulating principle of national life, but unlike the policies allegedly practised by Pandit Nehru's government, Hindu refugees of Partition would have the same umbrella of security as Muslim refugees (Sardar Patel and Nehru's fellow UP-ite PD Tandon were among those who felt the first PM of free India was discriminating against Hindu refugees), and India would abjure Gandhian notions of absolutist non-violence in favour of military preparedness and alertness that would thwart any attempt to disturb the country's borders. Savarkar spoke openly against the Nehru-led establishment's professed ideals of non-alignment and dismarmament, not because they were undesirable but because, according to him, the surest way of keeping peace was a readiness for confrontation. This stripping down of the one-time Nehruvian consensus and implementation of a Savarkar-ian vision, it could be argued, is already well under way. If the law to ban triple talaq is projected as the end of the ""appeasement era,"" the embrace of Hindu symbols, right from Modi's performance of an aarti in Varanasi to his Himalayan cave sojourn before the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, is indication that there will be an unreserved recognition of the Hindu underpinnings of Indian civilization. The revoking of Articles 370 and 35A is elucidation of Savarkar's 'one nation one law' idea, and the Balakot airstrikes and the post-Uri surgical strikes the kind of display of military strength the Hindutva hero would've much appreciated. For the Modi regime, a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, followed perhaps by a Uniform Civil Code, would equally be in keeping with Savarkar's vision of an unapologetic Hindu-ness as the genuine guarantor of secular interests, just as the moon and space missions would reflect his desired push - without any attendant rituals, of course -- for an embrace of science and technology. Besides, according to Savarkar's 1921 tract on Hindutva, those who did not consider India their ""pitrubhu"" and ""punyabhu"" - fatherland and holy land - could well find themselves beyond the ambit of Indian nationhood. So factor in the Citizenship Amendment Bill and the National Register of Citizens as well. Savarkar's elevation as Bharat Ratna posthumously, above all, would tick off an all-important point on the BJP's agenda -- of bringing into the spotlight key personalities linked to the freedom movement who were for long overshadowed by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. Savarkar's ideas are a part of government policies; the Bharat Ratna would be his formal anointment as the Modi government's lodestar. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Nyay is like chicken seller’s plan to make Rs 1 lakh with a hen: CM Fadnavis - Times of India,"BHIWANDI: Questioning the feasibility of the Nyunatam Aay Yojana (NYAY) promised by the Congress, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday likened the opposition party’s assurance to a chicken seller’s loan repayment gambit. Under NYAY, Congress proposes to give Rs72,000 per year to the poorest in the country. Addressing a rally in Bhiwandi, he narrated an anecdote where a chicken seller who owes Rs1 lakh gives the lender one chicken. “Asked how this is repayment, the chicken seller says a hen can help make Rs 1 lakh. The seller says the hen will lay two eggs, and the hens from them will lay four eggs and they will go on multiplying. Similar is the Congress's NYAY. The Congress does not know exactly how they will pay the money (to the poor), but makes promises,” he said at the rally while campaigning for BJP MP Kapil Patil. The CM said Congress failed to eliminate poverty despite ruling the country for 60 years, but makes promises of removing poverty during every election. He also slammed the Congress for seeking proof regarding the Balakot air strike. The CM said countries such as the US, Russia and China have confirmed the air strike, but only Pakistan and the Congress are demanding proof of air strike. Fadnavis further said, “Had we known that they would ask for proof, we would have tied a Congress leader with the fighter planes that carried out the air strikes.” Speaking at a rally in Dombivli later, the CM questioned the Congress promise to remove sedition law. “Is it a Congress manifesto or of terror group Jaish- e-Muhammed? Shouldn’t we have a sedition law to deal with those working against the country and our Constitution?” Fadnavis said. Campaigning in Dombivli for Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde, he took a dig at NCP chief Sharad Pawar for his decision not to contest the Lok Sabha election. The CM compared Pawar to 12th player of a cricket team. “Earlier, the NCP chief said he would contest polls from Madha and entered the cricket stadium. But after seeing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Googly, he (Pawar) left the cricket match,” Fadnavis said adding that the NCP is in such a situation that it’s not getting candidates to contest the LS polls.

Addressing a public rally in Hathras in support of party candidate, Rajveer Singh Diler, Rajnath castigated the Congress for demanding proof of the air strikes and urged the people to believe in what he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said on the issue.

NDA has shown that running honest government is possible in this country: PM Modi - Times of India,"UDAIPUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday said the NDA has shown that running an honest government is possible in the country and accused the Congress of cheating people for seven decades. Addressing an election rally in Udaipur, Modi said that his government has taken decisive action against terrorism while the opposition has let down the country with the "" saboot gang"" seeking proof of the Balakot air strike. ""The NDA has shown that running an honest government in the country is possible. With your support a new tradition of honesty is being established in the entire country,"" the prime minister said. The prime minister targeted the previous UPA government saying that it pressured the banks to give loan to ""its millionaire friends, but our government gave loans to poor, tribals and youths under the Mudra scheme"". ""Now, if someone has fled abroad, either he will have to return or he will be extradited just like Michel 'mama' of naamdaars. If any rich does not return money taken as loans from bank, then he will not be able to sleep comfortably,"" he said referring to British-national Christian Michel, alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper case who was arrested after his extradition from Dubai.

Balakot strike the theme of Young Boys Club’s Puja | Kolkata News - Times of India,"This year, the Young Boys Club will celebrate its golden jubilee with the theme of Balakot Air Surgical Strikes. The club, which turns 50this year, is recreating the entire sequence of the Balakot strikes along with a fighter plane, a mock-up of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who went deep into Pakistani territory and the subsequent jubilation that gripped the entire nation.  The strike was conducted by India in the early morning hours of February 26, when Indian warplanes crossed the de facto border in the disputed region of Kashmir and dropped bombs in the vicinity of the town of Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. The airstrike was the first time since the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 that attacking warplanes had crossed the Line of Control.  Dev Shankar Mahesh, from Midnapore, is the artist of the pandal that is about 40 feet in height.  Rakesh Singh, from the club, said, “After the huge success of our 49th year, the entire team is fully charged up for the golden jubilee celebration. We will be showcasing Balakot Air Surgical Strike as our theme, since we decided to pay homage to our soldiers who sacrifice their lives for the country.”  The strike is a very important event for this country. “We are depicting the event totally from the perspective of our armed forces, whose contribution is immense in keeping the country safe from external threats. We are recreating the entire sequence just outside and at the entrance of the pandal. It will give visitors an idea about how the entire offensive was executed. There will also be a mock-up of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who became a national hero after the strikes,” said Vikrant Singh, another club member.

 JeM chief Masood Azhar on constant move since Balakot air strikes | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Jaish-e-Mohammad chief   Masood Azhar   who had been shifted by the Pakistani Army from Rawalpindi base hospital to Goth Ganni, Bhawalpur, after the Indian air strikes against his terror camp in Balakot, is now lodged in an Islamic seminary in Sheikhupura, Gujrawala, around 300 kms from Islamabad. Highly placed intelligence sources told TOI that Azhar, who was designated by the UNSC on Wednesday as global terrorist, has been on the move from one hideout to another since the Balakot air strikes. Following the terror attack in Pulwama on a CRPF convoy that killed 44 jawans, Azhar was provided 10 Pakistan Special Service Group commandos as additional security cover. Interestingly, Azhar last week visited and stayed in Athmuqam, a major camping town for terror groups, in Neelam valley near the Line of Control, sources said. Just four days ago, sources said, he stayed with Pakistani Army in Jura town of Pakistan occupied Kashmir, over 100kms northeast of Islamabad. Sources said the Indian security establishment perceived Azhar’s visit to Athmuqam as an “important development”. “Given the fact that Azhar has been suffering from a serious ailment and requires constant medical care and attention, his visit and meeting with the Army is significant. Instead of sending his younger brother Rauf Azghar, who is now the operational incharge of the terror group, he went himself. It is an indicator that Azhar had been anticipating the move by China at the UNSC,” a source said. Azhar may have gone to discuss the future of his outfit and persuade the Pakistani Army to allow his cadres, who have now joined and merged with another terror outfit Al Badr, to infiltrate into Kashmir, sources said. “The window for infiltration begins in April when the snow begins to melt on the mountains along the LoC. Jaish, which is now essentially Al Badr, is desperate to send its men into Kashmir but given the international pressure since the Pulwama terror attack and the subsequent Balakot strikes, its not easy for Pakistani Army to provide cover to the infiltrators. Azhar went to meet the Army on behalf of his cadres who are ready to enter Kashmir under their new name Al Badr,” a senior officer, who tracks the movement of terror groups across LoC, said. Since the Pulwama terror attack, Indian security forces in Kashmir killed around 25 Jaish terrorists including its top leadership.

"Narendra Modi:  Congress moves EC against Modi 'roadshow' after voting, calls him 'uncaring offender' - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday moved the EC alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took out a ""road show"" after casting his vote as well   as made political remarks in violation   of the model code of conduct, and demanded that a campaign ban of 2-3 days be imposed on him for being an ""uncaring offender"". The opposition party also made a representation to the Election Commission (EC) over alleged model code of conduct violation by BJP chief Amit Shah and demanded a 72-hour campaign ban on him. The Congress delegation comprising Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Jairam Ramesh and K Raju told the EC that Shah ""openly raised Balakot air strikes, Pulwama attack and armed forces"" while seeking votes in Krishnanagar, West Bengal. The party strongly raised the issue of alleged violation of the model code of conduct by the Prime Minister. After casting his vote in Ahmedabad, Modi walked some distance from the polling booth and interacted briefly with mediapersons. ""Prime Minister is occupying a high post. The bigger the post, the bigger the responsibility. We have told the Election Commission that instead of caring about the responsibility, the Prime Minister is repeatedly violating the model code of conduct,"" Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters outside the EC. He said the Congress had written to the EC last night complaining about the ""violation of the model code of conduct"" by Modi after casting his vote in the past. ""Our prediction came true as in today's polling after casting his vote, the Prime Minister took out a long road show, gave speeches and political statements soon after voting,"" Singhvi said. There has never been such clear and transparent violation of the model code of conduct, Singhvi alleged. ""We told the EC that he is a habitual, egregious, and completely uncaring offender. He doesn't care for the EC,"" the Congress leader said. ""It is very distressing and sad. There is no point taking 5-10 days before responding. We said action should be taken against the PM within hours and a campaign ban be imposed on him for 48 or 72 hours,"" he said. The Congress memorandum to the EC alleged that the Prime Minister had made detailed plans to undertake, in defiance of electoral laws, a roadshow before and after he voted. ""We urged the Commission to take preventive steps as the Prime Minister has a history of violating the law by taking out elaborate road shows in the general elections 2014 and Gujarat Assembly Elections in 2017,"" the memorandum said. ""If the EC doesn't enforce what it commands uniformly and without fear or favour then the sanctity of this Commission stands compromised. Such brazen violations call for immediate exercise of this Commission's wide powers against the offenders,"" it said. Singhvi said the EC has not taken action on earlier complaints against the Prime Minister, while action has been taken against UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. ""So, there cannot be double standards as laws are the same for everybody,"" he said. The Congress' memorandum against Shah called for urgent and necessary directions against the BJP chief for what it termed as ""continuous and repeated"" violation of the model code of conduct.

 Wish India possessed Rafale jets during Balakot strike: Rajnath | India News - Times of India,"THANE: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said had India possessed Rafale fighter jets earlier the IAF would not have needed to enter Balakot in Pakistan to hit the terror camps. Addressing a poll rally for BJP's Mira Bhayander nominee Narendra Mehta in Maharashtra's Thane district neighbouring Mumbai, Singh defended performing 'shastra puja' while taking delivery of the first Rafale jet in France recently. ""Had we possessed Rafale fighter jets we would not have required to enter Balakot and launch a strike. We could have struck at Balakot while sitting in India,"" he said. Singh reiterated that the fighter planes were meant only for self-defence and not for aggression. On a controversy surrounding the ""shastra puja"", Singh said, ""I wrote 'Om' on the plane, broke a coconut (as per tradition). Om depicts never-ending Universe"". ""I acted as per my faith. Even other communities like the Christian, Muslim, Sikh etc worship with words like Amen, Omkar etc. Even when I was performing 'shastra puja', people from communities like Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists were present at the event,"" he said. At a ceremony in France on Tuesday, Singh formally took the delivery of the first of the 36 long-awaited French-made aircraft acquired by the Indian Air Force. He also took a sortie in the two-seater jet. The Congress has accused Singh of ""drama"" over performing ""shastra puja"". On his Rafale sortie, Singh said he had asked the flight captain to fly at supersonic speed. ""Only I and the captain, who was from Paris, were there inside the plane. I wanted to experience the supersonic speed,"" he said. Linking the supersonic speed with governance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said, ""Our government is progressing at supersonic speed while the Congress and the NCP are going down at supersonic speed"". In his speech, the BJP veteran accused the Congress of practicing ""divide and rule"" policy to pit one religion against another. ""But the BJP government does not want such feuds between communities and castes,"" he said, adding that no communal riots had taken place under the BJP rule since 2014 unlike the days when the Congress used to be in power. He also praised Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for his performance. ""Unlike some other chief ministers of the past, Fadnavis never embroiled in any controversy. The CM plays the role of a 'Sevak' (servant of people),"" Singh added. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" Post-Balakot, Indian Navy hunted for Pakistani submarine for 21 days | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Soon after the   Pulwama terror attack   , India pulled out its Navy from an exercise and deployed a major part of its fleet, including nuclear and conventional submarines, close to Pakistani territorial waters. During the aggressive deployment of the naval assets by the Indian side, the Pakistanis were getting an impression that New Delhi might use its maritime force to avenge the killing of its 40 CRPF personnel in the suicide bombing by Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM). India was continuously keeping an eye on the movement of the Pakistani military but after Indian Air Force hit the Jaish terrorist facility in Balakot, one of the most advanced Pakistani Agosta-class submarines - PNS Saad - vanished from the Pakistani waters, a senior government source said. Having accounted for all other surface warships and all the submarines, the vanishing act done by the PNS Saad fitted with Air Independent Propulsion (a technology which allows the submarines to stay for a longer period under the water than normal submarines) swung the entire Indian Navy into action. ""The location near Karachi from where the PNS Saad vanished, it could reach the Gujarat coast in three days and the headquarters of the western fleet in Mumbai within five days and was seen as a major threat to the security of the country,"" the sources said. The anti-submarine warfare specialist warships and aircraft were positioned to help in the hunt for the missing Pakistani submarine. ""All the areas where it could have gone in the given timeframe, extensive searches were carried out by the Indian Navy. P-8Is were pressed into service to locate the submarine along with the coastal areas of Gujarat followed by Maharashtra and other states,"" the sources said. All precautionary measures had been taken by the Navy to ensure that even if the PNS Saad had entered Indian waters, all necessary actions were to be taken to force it to come on the surface, and if required take military punitive action against it, the sources said. Nuclear submarine INS Chakra had also been deployed in an aggressive posture along the Pakistani waters and instructed to keep looking for the missing Pakistani submarine. The Indian Navy's latest induction, Scorpene-class submarine INS Kalvari, was also deployed in the hunt while their posture kept threatening Pakistan against doing any misadventure in the Indian waters. As the days progressed, the Indian Navy kept expanding its area of search for the Pakistani boat and satellites were also used to locate it, meanwhile, the force was almost certain that the Pakistanis may have kept it hidden somewhere else. After 21 days of extensive search, the Indian Navy finally located the PNS Saad on the western side of Pakistan. It was sent there for hiding to ensure a covert capability in case of extension in hostilities in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes. Sources said the Navy is maintaining complete surveillance of the Arabian Sea, especially Pakistani waters, and is aware of Pakistan's naval activities in the area. Soon after the tensions spiked, the Navy had deployed over 60 warships, including the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, along with its battle group as part of a rapid redeployment in the North Arabian Sea. ""The overwhelming superiority of Indian Navy in all three dimensions forced the Pakistan Navy to remain deployed close to the Makran coast and not venture out in the open ocean,"" a statement by Indian Navy spokesperson Captain DK Sharma had said at that time.

 No decision yet on airspace closure to India: Qureshi | India News - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said that no decision has been taken yet to close the airspace to India, underlining that any such step would be taken after looking into each and every aspect of the move through consultation. Qureshi dismissed as speculative reports suggesting that the airspace was being shut for India, the Dawn reported. Pakistan shuts 3 international air routes till Aug 31Talking to reporters during a visit to the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) on Wednesday, he said the issue did come up for discussions during the recent federal cabinet meeting but the final decision in this regard would be taken by Prime Minister Imran Khan. “A decision to this effect will be taken after due consideration and looking into each and every aspect of the move through consultation,” he was quoted as saying. Qureshi's statement came after science and technology minister   Fawad Chaudhry took to the twitter   on Tuesday and announced that the government was considering complete closure of airspace to India and complete ban on use of Pakistan land routes for Indian trade to Afghanistan. Pakistan had fully closed its airspace in February after an Indian Air Force strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot. The country opened its airspace for all flights except for New Delhi, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur on March 27. On May 15, Pakistan extended its airspace ban for flights to India till May 30. It fully opened its airspace for all civilian traffic on July 16. Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after India abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories. Pakistan expelled the Indian high commissioner after it downgraded the diplomatic ties with India in protest to India's decision to end Jammu and Kashmir's special status.

Modi: Opposition playing to Pakistan gallery on air strike | Kanpur News - Times of India,"KANPUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday attacked the Opposition for questioning the airstrikes on terror camps in Balakot in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack. He said Pakistan is playing upon the statements of Opposition leaders to spread lies against India. Such irresponsible behaviour demotivates the Army, he said. “The way, the Opposition is demanding proof of airstrikes in Balakot is actually benefiting Pakistan, which has been harbouring terrorism. I am making this allegation against my political rivals as they have become blind in their dislike for me and are damaging the interests of the nation,” said Modi. “The whole world is putting pressure on Pakistan, but statements by some people in our country are actually helping it. It’s unfortunate that attempts are being made to demean the valour of Army. How can we forgive those who make such statements that please Pakistan and give it a chance to criticise India despite being under tremendous global pressure,” he said. PM asked the crowd to tell him if they are satisfied with airstrikes on terror camp in Balakot after the dastardly attack in Pulwama. When the crowd responded with cheers and a loud ‘yes’, he said: “While your chest has swelled with pride on air strikes, they (opposition) are using it to settle political scores with me. Will you forgive them?” Terming the proposed grand alliance as a ‘huge adulteration’, PM said that Opposition hates him because he’s fighting a decisive war against terrorism, corruption and poverty. “Mahagathbandhan is actually ‘mahamilawat’ (huge adulteration), which people will reject in coming elections,” said PM. PM Modi was addressing a gathering in Kanpur after launching development projects of Rs 66.20 crore and flagging off Lucknow Metro’s 23 km North-South corridor, through video conferencing on Friday. Paying tributes to CRPF’s Shyam Babu who was martyred in Pulwama attack and IAF corporal Deepak Pandey who lost his life in Budgam chopper crash, Modi said many brave men and women were born in Kanpur and made a huge contribution in the country’s freedom struggle. “These projects launched on the soil of bravehearts of freedom struggle, will transform lives of people in Kanpur and the state,” Modi said. PM also laid the foundation of Agra Metro Rail project, and handed keys of houses to PM Awas Yojana beneficiaries. Earlier Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed ‘bhoomi pujan’ and laid the foundation stone of the development and beautification project in the premises of Kashi Vishwanath Temple (KVT). He claimed that “non-cooperation” of the previous government in the state was responsible for the delay in start of the ambitious Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham project (corridor extension and beautification plan) in his Lok Sabha constituency. “In the first three years there was non-cooperation by the state government. Developmental projects took pace after you made Yogi Adityanath the chief minister,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Pakistan threatens to close its airspace for India once again | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan yet again threatened to close its airspace for overflying to and from India on Tuesday, less than one and a half months after   it had re-opened the same   . Pakistan PM Imran Khan chaired a cabinet meeting following which his cabinet colleague Fawad Chaudhry tweeted, “PM is considering a complete closure of air space to India, a complete ban on use of Pakistan land routes for Indian trade to Afghanistan was also suggested in cabinet meeting, legal formalities for these decisions are under consideration... #Modi has started we’ll finish!” PM is considering a complete closure of Air Space to India, a complete ban on use of Pakistan Land routes for India… https://t.co/BCne20klFT— Ch Fawad Hussain (@fawadchaudhry) 1566912470000Earlier, the 138-day-long closure of Pakistan airspace after the Balakot strike had seen airlines operating between parts of South Asia, with Delhi at its heart, and the West taking the longer Mumbai-Arabian Sea-Muscat-Gulf route and beyond. This led to rise in flying time; more travel time for east coast-bound flights to the US, including an additional stop; increased expenses due to more fuel burn; crew requirement and fuelling stops; and decreased connectivity with airlines like United and Air Canada pulling out of some India routes. However, Indian airlines were expecting a rerun of this after escalation of tension between India and Pakistan in recent days. A senior Air India (AI) pilot said: “We prepared our contingency plans on August 5 itself (when India nullified Article 370 and Pakistan started issuing threats). We will simply repeat what we did last time. Kicking in those plans will take from three hours to a day depending on the time of day when and if Pakistan actually closes its airspace as new flight plans will have to be filed and new time slots at airports abroad will need to be sought.” However, to implement these plans the government will have to give funds to AI for extra expenses on more fuel burn, crew requirement and additional fuelling stops. Oil companies have since last week stopped supply at six airports to AI group due to huge arrears. “We have designated a person just to monitor notice to airmen (Notam) that Pakistan issues and are monitoring the situation constantly. Pakistan’s threat won’t work and we are ready for their action of airspace closure if the government gives us funds for the extra expense that this move will again force us to incur,” said another senior pilot. India’s biggest airline IndiGo is also in a state of readiness — financially too, unlike AI — to deal with the airspace closure whenever it happens. Chaudhry’s tweet comes a day after Khan vowed during a televised address to the nation on Kashmir that Pakistan “will go to any lengths” to support the cause of the Kashmiri people. The threat comes at a time when some routes pulled out by foreign airlines during the 138-day-long closure (from February 27 to July 16) are yet to see any activity. US mega carrier United had suspended its Newark -Delhi nonstop on April 5 due to closure of Pakistani airspace and is supposed to restart the same from September 6. Air Canada had suspended its daily Delhi-Toronto nonstop on June 14 and had restarted it on August 1. Air India had also suspended operations on some routes like Delhi-Birmingham which restarted recently. Closure of Pakistan airspace may again see a re-run of longer flying times and particularly more expensive tickets due to airlines’ enhanced expenses.

" IAF missile brought down Mi-17 aircraft in Budgam, says probe | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: A surface-to-air missile of the Indian Air Force brought down the Mi-17 aircraft in Kashmir's Budgam on the morning of February 27 when the Indian and Pakistani air forces were engaged in a fierce dogfight, a high-level probe has concluded. After nearly six months of investigation, the IAF's court of inquiry also held five personnel of the force responsible for the crash, top government sources said Friday. Six IAF personnel on board the chopper and a civilian on the ground were killed in the crash. The CoI into the incident found that the Mi-17 V-5 helicopter was hit by a ground-based missile of the Indian Air Force when the chopper was on its way back to Srinagar air base, the sources said. Five IAF personnel, including the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Srinagar base, were held responsible for the crash and all of them are likely to face severe punishment, sources said. ""The guilty personnel will face severe punishment as per provisions of the military law,"" said a source, adding that the IAF top brass will decide on the quantum of punishment for those held responsible for the incident. The IAF will initiate strong action against the guilty based on the report of the CoI. This could include charging the guilty with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the sources said. There is no immediate comment from the IAF on the findings of the probe. The probe found that the 'Identification of Friend or Foe' (IFF) system on-board the helicopter was switched off and there were ""vital gaps"" in communication and coordination between the ground staff and the crew of the chopper. It also found violations of standard operating procedures. The IFF helps air defence radars identify whether an aircraft or helicopter is friendly or hostile. The helicopter crashed in Budgam around 10 am on February 27 when Indian and Pakistani fighter jets were engaged in fierce aerial combat in Nowshera, a day after India's air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan. The helicopter went down around 10 minutes after taking off. Official sources said the helicopter was asked to return because of the dogfight 100 km away from Srinagar. A missile was fired at the helicopter as the IAF ground staff thought it was an enemy chopper. The IAF headquarters had ordered a CoI into the incident under an Air Commodore-ranked officer. In early May, the IAF transferred the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) of Srinagar base to ensure a thorough probe into the incident. Sources said the CoI was also specifically focusing on examining the role of various people, including those controlling the air defence system when the helicopter was hit by the surface-to-air missile.

 No Pakistan soldier or citizen died in Balakot air strike: Sushma Swaraj | India News - Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: External affairs minister and BJP leader Sushma Swaraj on Thursday said no Pakistani soldier or citizen died in the air strike carried out by the Indian Air Force across the border in response to the Pulwama terror attack in February. Addressing women party workers here, she stressed on a 2014-like full majority BJP-led government this time also, saying former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee could not do everything which he wanted to because he was heading a coalition administration. The IAF had struck a Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot area on February 26, in response to the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. Swaraj said the air strike was carried out in self- defence. ""When we carried out air strike across the border after the Pulwama terror attack, we had told the international community that we took that step in self-defence only."" ""We had told the international community that the armed forces were instructed not to harm any Pakistani citizen or its soldier during the strike,"" she said. ""The Army was told to target only the terror camps of the Jaish-e-Mohammad, which had taken the responsibility for the Pulwama attack. ""And, our Army did the same without harming any Pakistani citizen or soldier,"" said Swaraj. The foreign minister said the entire international community had supported India over the air strike. Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she said he has emerged as a top international leader who sets the agenda for the world. Referring to the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, Swaraj said the then Congress-led UPA government had failed to take along other countries to isolate Pakistan in the world despite the fact that 40 foreign citizens belonging to 14 countries had also died in the strike. The external affairs minister said Pakistan had raised objection to the invitation extended to India for a meet of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Abu Dhabi last month, but the host county UAE snubbed Islamabad. Stressing on a full majority government led by the BJP this time also, Swaraj said Vajpayee could not do all the things he wanted because he was heading a coalition government (1998-2004). Swaraj, who was a minister in the Vajpayee cabinet also, said coalition governments face pressure. ""You must be wondering how Modiji could do so many things in these five years. He could do it because he was heading a full majority government. ""If he was running a coalition government, then he might have been in some pressure,"" she said. ""I have seen it.

Many observers see 2019 election as inflection point in Indian history: CRS - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: Many observers see the 2019 election as an inflection point in Indian history, according to a latest US Congressional report which said that a repeat performance by the ruling BJP in the polls could herald a new era of single-party dominance. In the report prepared primarily for US lawmakers, the independent Congressional Research Service (CRS) on the ongoing elections said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""has become the primary, if not sole target of the opposition"", but no individual challenger has emerged. The CRS reports warns that a continuation of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led administration could entail an ""unwelcome continuation of its perceived illiberal policies"". ""A repeat performance could thus herald a new era of single-party dominance. Perhaps more crucially, the election pits an unabashedly Hindu nationalist prime minister and ruling party against an array of more secular minded parties, some focused on the interests of India's large lower-caste and Muslim minorities,"" said the CRS report. The CRS is the bipartisan and independent research wing of the US Congress which prepares reports on various domestic and global issues for the lawmakers for information purposes only. The reports, prepared by subject experts, are not considered an official view of the US Congress. While Congress president chief Rahul Gandhi, ""the inheritor of a family dynasty that includes three past prime ministers"", has the highest profile among potential leaders of an opposition coalition, the CRS report says the opposition's zeal to oust the NDA has led to some unusual alliances ""In January, the leaders of two powerful Uttar Pradesh-based parties agreed to set aside their bitter rivalry to cooperate in defeating the BJP. Other influential regional parties are maneuvering toward a potential opposition grand alliance,"" said the report dated March 28. Prime Minister Modi and his BJP aspire to win another five-year term with a ruling majority. The Congress party -historically dominant, but badly defeated in 2014-seeks to build on recent state-level wins and potentially ally with powerful regional opposition parties to dislodge the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in New Delhi, according to the report accessed by PTI. ""Many observers see the upcoming election as an inflection point in Indian history. BJP's 2014 win, with 52 per cent of Lok Sabha seats, marked an end to 30 years of coalition politics at the national level,"" it said. ""Coalition governments are sometimes faulted for instability, but they may also compel leaders to negotiate and take account of a wider variety of perspectives, while secure majority governments can lead to complacency and arrogance,"" the CRS said. Noting that secularism has been a more-or-less enshrined value in India, although its conception in both theory and practice varies widely, the Congressional report says Indian voters may face a landmark choice between two overarching identities for their country - one, a pluralist, secular polity where religious minorities enjoy full equality; the other, a nation in which roughly 250 million non-Hindu citizens must accept Hindu majoritarianism, with potentially dire consequences for for India's civil liberties. Authored by CRS's South Asia specialist K Alan Kronstadt, the report observes that given weak economic performance, the BJP-led government arguably is seeking to generate voter enthusiasm through Hindu identity. The February Pulwama terrorist attack and Balakot air strikes by India is likely to benefit the ruling party, the report said. ""The February 2019 bombing in Kashmir, blamed on a Pakistan-based terrorist group, and an unprecedented retaliatory airstrike on Pakistani territory, pushed foreign affairs into the headlines and triggered a sharp spike of Indian nationalism that is widely expected to benefit the incumbent BJP,"" it said. As far as India-US relationship is concerned, it is unlikely to have any impact irrespective of any government that comes to power after the May general elections, it said. The trend toward closer bilateral ties most likely will continue regardless of a leadership change in New Delhi, it said. ""Many analysts contend that Modi and the BJP have been and would continue to be more open to aligning with US regional strategy- perhaps especially that seeking to balance against growing Chinese influence-and more energetic in pursuing economic reforms than would be any likely alternative Indian leadership,"" it said.

"Indian Air Force:   Post air strikes, LoC peaceful, troops on high alert | India News - Times of India","JAMMU: Tranquillity prevailed along the Indo-Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) on Monday after India carried out air strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) and destroyed terror camps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. However, the troops are on high alert, a senior Army officer said. ""The situation is peaceful along the LoC in J&K. There are no reports of any untoward incident reported from anywhere,"" the officer told PTI. Though, there was a brief ceasefire violation by the Pakistan army before the air strikes, he added. The situation was peaceful along 190km long International Border (IB) in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts as well with no reports of ceasefire violations, Border Security Force (BSF) officials said. ""There is no ceasefire violation anywhere (along IB) today. Border is peaceful, but alertness is being maintained,"" a BSF officer said. There was intermittent firing along the IB in Kanachak sector in Jammu district on Monday night, he added.

Make Balakot air strike the new normal: Major General GG Dwivedi | Chandigarh News - Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: Major General G G Dwivedi on Monday said make air strike like that in Balakot, the new normal as India needs more such strikes after Pakistan-supported terrorist organisations carry major terrorist attacks in the country. He said this at a special lecture on the theme 'Balakot: A Strategic Shift' organised by the department of Defence and National Security Studies, Panjab University, here on Monday. ""Our aim should be to give this message to Pakistan that there will be retaliation for every terrorist attack on India. There is a need to build a favourable international opinion for India as well as to aim to weaken Pakistan economically,"" said Dwivedi. Dr Jaskaran Singh Waraich, chairperson, department of Defence and National Security Studies, introduced the theme as well as the speaker to the audience. Speaking on the aftermath of the Balakot strikes, Dwivedi stated that it reflects a strategic shift in India's policy towards terrorism. ""The Pakistani state since its inception has always aimed at proving themselves superior to India and in this quest has initiated various wars to inflict defeat on India. However, as every nation learns from history, post the crushing defeat it suffered in the 1971 war, Pakistan realised that it cannot defeat India in the battlefield because of India being a bigger power in every sphere. Thus, Pakistan initiated proxy war against India which proved to be a profitable act on their part. Where India has lacked is dealing with this situation as a counter terrorism situation instead of following a counter proxy war approach,"" he added. He said Pakistan's strategy has three basic characteristics, first being using terrorists as a strategic asset, second being its reliance on nuclear weapons, and third, taking advantage of various military alliances such as NATO and SEATO in the past and its alliance with China in the present. Through its relations with Pakistan, China is aiming at keeping India marginalised through its preoccupation with Pakistan.  The lecture was followed by Q&A session with the audience.

Congress was in mourning after Balakot air strike: Amit Shah - Times of India,"NAGPUR: BJP president Amit Shah Tuesday targeted the Congress, saying when the whole country was rejoicing over the air strikes on a terror camp in Balakot, there was mourning only in Pakistan and the Rahul Gandhi-led party. Addressing a rally here, he said the Modi government's biggest success was that it had made India secure which was not the case when the Congress-led UPA was in power. ""During the UPA rule, there would be no response to terror attacks. After the Pulwama terror attack, there was anger and despondency all over. ""But, the present government is not that of `mauni baba' (silent PM) Manmohan Singh. On the 13th day of the Pulwama attack, the IAF (Indian Air Force) went deep inside Pakistan and destroyed terror camps,"" Shah said. ""When the country was rejoicing (over the air strikes), there was mourning only in Pakistan and Rahul Gandhi -led Congress. When 40 jawans are martyred, should we not bomb the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack,"" he asked. Hitting out at the Congress president, he said, ""Rahul baba .. you can do ILU ILU with terrorists, but we will give ""eent ka jawab patthar se"" (a resolute and befitting reply)."" Shah also accused the Congress of maligning Hindus by coining words like ""Hindu terror and saffron terror"". Shah was campaigning for Union minister and BJP leader Nitin Gadkari, who is pitted against Nana Patole of the Congress in the Nagpur Lok Sabha constituency, which goes to the polls on April 11. Shah said the Congress did not find a nominee against Gadkari and hence it had to ""import"" its candidate from outside. Patole had won the 2014 Lok Sabha election on a BJP ticket from the Bhandara-Gondiya seat in Vidarbha. He quit the BJP in 2017 and later joined the Congress. Patole was earlier an MLA of the Congress. During his speech, Shah also listed the promises made in the BJP manifesto for farmers and traders, among other sections of the society. Nagpur is among the seven Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra that will vote on April 11. Tuesday was the last day of campaigning in these parliamentary seats.

" IAF Chief awards units for Balakot airstrikes, thwarting Pakistan attack | India News - Times of India","GHAZIABAD: Indian Air Force on Tuesday awarded the different squadrons involved in the Balakot airstrikes and thwarting Pakistan aerial attack on February 27.  Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman's 51 Squadron was awarded unit citation by Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria for thwarting Pakistani aerial attack and shooting down enemy F-16 fighter aircraft on February 27, earlier this year.  Actively involved in operation Balakot in February this year, the squadron displayed exemplary courage and professional acumen to ensure victory in the aerial engagement claiming an enemy fighter aircraft in the process, the first instance since 1971 war. Squadron Leader Minty Agarwal's 601 Signal unit was also awarded for their role in Balakot aerial strikes and foiling the aerial attack by Pakistan in February.  The number nine squadron, whose Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft carried out the Balakot aerial strikes on February 26 was also awarded.  No 9 Squadron undertakes the in-depth analysis of the intelligence documents to assess the tactics of the enemy. The knowledge gained is then imparted to other fighter squadrons.  Post Pulwama terror attack, the Mirage 2000 aircraft were tasked to neutralise the terrorist camps in Pakistan's Balakot. The target was located approximately 1500 km from the airbase. Air-to-air refuelling was carried out in one of the heaviest operational configurations in inclement weather at 20,000 feet.

Air strike in Balakot has dwarfed other discussions ahead of polls - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Opponents of BJP see in the 2019 LS polls an opportunity to restore domination of their “idea of India” which sees the country as a “secular” polity and a collective of diverse social groups better served by a coalition marked by collegiate-style leadership. This is under serious challenge by BJP and Sangh Parivar, and a victory for Modi will entrench the vision which sees India defined by the primacy of Hindutva that overarches its diversity and which has failed to actualise its potential due to a Nehruvian negation of nationalism as a unifying factor and inspiration. It sees a strong leader as a pre-requisite for realisation of the project of national revival. The clash of ideas will be decided by numbers the ballot boxes yield on May 23. Meanwhile, speculation has intensified whether BJP can repeat its feat of winning a majority on its own and what will be the implications for its leadership if it falls short. While Modi and BJP have been frontrunners, the dynamics may have changed with the air strikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan. Just as more “ordinary” issues like employment, farm incomes, cow vigilantism, intolerance, economic growth and welfarism seemed to be framing the elections, the military action has dwarfed other discussions, at least for now. The contrast the PM’s offers between his “decisive” action and Congress-UPA’s cautious approach — and his linking this to the majority he enjoys in Lok Sabha — separates two differing visions. Modi has emerged as a symbol of unapologetic Hindu cultural assertion, which also blends a potent mix of economic growth and welfarism appealing to aspirational and youthful voters. In contrast, his political rivals — regional, OBC and Dalit leaders such as Mamata Banerjee, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati — rely on caste alliances and secular-communal politics to attack BJP as an upper caste party that subsumes lower caste aspirations in the name of Hindu assimilation. Congress, looking to retrieve its centre space, has attacked the efficacy of every major policy from demonetisation, GST, surgical strikes to air raids on Pakistan’s Balakot. While the challenge for BJP is to ensure the public response to the air strikes sustains while hoping its pro-poor schemes along with low food inflation create a new vote bank, Congress and opposition parties will bank on incumbency and a consolidation of anti-BJP votes, particularly the minorities. The big challenge for Modi is the SP-BSP combination in UP, which threatened BJP’s sweep of the state in 2014. BJP has sought to counter this through Modi’s stature (and his OBC background) and an ambitious outreach to non-Jatav Dalits and non-Yadav OBCs. Other spoilers are regional leaders holding their own in big states like West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. A major part of the poll action will be fought in states where BJP and Congress face off. Last time round, BJP did well in Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Maharashtra, MP, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Goa, Assam and Haryana, which add up to 216 seats. With BJP having already reached saturation point in these territories and in UP, Congress naturally hopes to do better, with the results of assembly elections in November whetting its ambition. The outcome might turn on the scale of its losses in states it swept and whether it will be able to make up for those with gains elsewhere.

 How Pakistan failed to do a Balakot-type strike on India on February 27 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A day after the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out aerial strikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist camp in Balakot, the Pakistani Air Force tried to carry out a similar attack against Indian military targets but failed to do so. ""On February 27, the Pakistani Air Force with its package of more than 20 planes led by the American F-16s along with the French Mirage-IIIs and Chinese JF-17, fired 11 H-4 1,000 kg bombs from ranges of around 50 kms inside their territory at military targets at three locations but failed to hit any of them,"" government sources revealed to ANI. The H-4 bombs fired by the Mirage-IIIs of the Pakistan Air Force are classified as stand-off weapons which can be launched from a distance to aid in quicker evasive manoeuvres of jets that fire them, similar to the Spice-2000 bombs used by the Indian Air Force in the Balakot strikes. H-4 bombs are made by Pakistan with the assistance of South Africa. ""The H-4s are not very accurate and missed their targets. In one of the attacks on an army camp in Jammu and Kashmir, the building was protected by a tall and thick tree which suffered extensive damage but deflected the Pakistani bomb,"" the sources added. It is learnt that senior officers were present inside the campus when the attacks took place. The three locations where the bombs fell are in Poonch and adjoining sectors. A Board of Officers has been formed to analyse the remains of the Pakistani bombs and other debris from the explosion caused by the bombs. The government sources speaking on condition of anonymity to ANI due to their close proximity to operational knowledge, speculate that the reason for Pakistani jets missing their targets could be the quick response of Indian jets flying at high speeds to repulse the attack. In haste, the H-4 bombs were let off thereby missing their intended targets. The Pakistani fighter planes had taken off from different bases on February 27 and started gathering over Pakistan occupied Kashmir and their Northern Areas before they turned around to launch attacks on Indian military targets. The most advanced Pakistani fighter F-16s were used for launching the air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets defending air space while the Mirage IIIs were used for launching air to ground missiles in the attacks. It was during this aggression that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman shot down an F-16 plane using his R-73 air-to-air missile fired from his MiG-21 plane. Indian Su-30MKIs flying in air defence roles used Chaffs, a tactic of offloading flares to dodge missiles and deft flying manoeuvres to dodge the AIM-20 AMRAAMs fired by the F-16s.

 Balakot extends Pak woman’s wait for Indian citizenship | India News - Times of India,"HYDERABAD: For the past seven years, Sumayra Farooqui, a Pakistani national living in India, has been eagerly waiting to become an Indian citizen. But because of a cruel twist of fate — and the Balakot air strikes — she may have to wait another seven years before she can call herself an Indian. Sumayra (36) got married to Shaik Ajaz Mohiuddin of Hyderabad in Karachi in 2011, and last year finished seven years in India — the period needed to apply for citizenship. Just before the Balakot strikes, she had gone to Pakistan with her two kids (who were born here and have Indian citizenship) to visit her ailing father. She was to return on a Lahore-Delhi flight on February 27, a day after the surgical strikes, but was offloaded as the airspace between the two countries had become a no-fly zone. “I was forced to overstay in Pakistan because I was offloaded. The flight would not go to Delhi because of restrictions on airspace. I wanted to be allowed to travel up to Dubai but even that was not allowed, and I was stranded in Lahore,” Sumayra told TOI. Three days later, her Indian visa expired. Sumayra, who had gone to Pakistan on December 4, 2018 on a three-month no obligation to return to India visa, made a fresh application and returned Hyderabad on June 1 this year. She reported, as per rules, at the foreigners’ regional registration office in Shamshabad on June 2 and was informed that her file had been closed as she had overstayed in Pakistan. She would have to apply afresh to become an Indian citizen. “It was not my fault. Technically, I was on the flight back to India on February 27 and I was offloaded by the authorities there,” Sumayra insists. She has now written to the Hyderabad joint commissioner of police to help her out. “My husband is an Indian national and my children are Indian nationals. I also want to be an Indian,” she said in the letter, and requested that her previous file be continued so that she could apply for Indian nationality. At the time of Partition, Sumarya’s parents settled in Pakistan. They are related to her husband Ajaz’s parents. Because of the family relationship, Ajaz and Sumayra got married in Karachi in 2011 with Ajaz travelling to Karachi for the wedding. Sumayra moved here soon after. “I have not received any application personally from the lady seeking Indian citizenship,” Hyderabad joint commissioner of police (special branch) Tarun Joshi told TOI. “When she was stuck in Pakistan, her family had approached me and I guided them on who to approach in Pakistan. I am not aware about her return to India but if her file is stuck due to technical reasons, I will look into it and forward it to the Union ministry of home affairs.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
China welcomes goodwill message exchange between PM Modi and Imran Khan on Pakistan National Day - Times of India,"BEIJING: China on Monday welcomed the goodwill messages exchanged by Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan on the occasion of Pakistan National Day, saying it will play a constructive role and supports resolving the differences between the two nations through dialogue and consultations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeted his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan on the occasion of Pakistan Day on March 23, saying : ""It was time for the people of the sub-continent to work together for a democratic, peaceful, progressive and prosperous region, in an atmosphere free of terror and violence"". Welcoming PM Modi's greeting, Khan in a tweet said: ""As we celebrate Pakistan Day I believe it is time to begin a comprehensive dialogue with India to address & resolve all issues, esp the central issue of Kashmir, & forge a new relationship based on peace & prosperity for all our people"". PM Modi's message to the Pak PM came in the midst of severe strain in ties between the two nuclear-armed neighbours following the Pulwama attack and the subsequent air strikes by India on a Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot. China welcomed the goodwill message sent out to each other by Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan. “We noted the relevant reports. We welcome the goodwill (messages) sent out to each other by India and Pakistani leaders. We support the two sides in maintaining engagement and improve of their relations, stabilise the situation and resolve their differences. China will continue to play a constructive role to this end,” Geng Shuang, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told a media briefing here. Answering a question whether China recalibrated its position on India-Pakistan to mediate between the two countries to resolve the differences, he said that China's position on India and Pakistan relations is consistent. “China's position on India and Pakistan relations is consistent. These two countries are important South Asian countries, and we hope they will resolve the issues through dialogue and consultation. China hopes to stay in friendly relations with both of them and we will continue to play a constructive role in promoting the peace talks between these two countries,” he said. Following the recent tensions between India and Pakistan, China called for restraint between the two countries and sent its vice foreign minister, Kong Kong Xuanyou, to Pakistan for talks with the Pakistani leaders. Also, the India-Pakistan tension arising out of the Pulwama terrorist attack became the focal point of the first strategic dialogue between Pakistan foreign minister Shan Mahmood Qureshi and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi here on March 19 during which Wang had “commended” the restraint shown by Pakistan in the recent tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad. Recently, China for the fourth time blocked a bid in the United Nations Security Council to designate the Pakistan-based chief of Jaish-e-Mohammed Masood Azhar as a ""global terrorist"" by putting a technical hold on the proposal, a move India termed as disappointing. The JeM has claimed responsibility for the February 14 Pulwama terror attack that left 40 CRPF personnel dead and raised tensions between India and Pakistan. The proposal to designate Azhar under the 1267 al-Qaida Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council was moved by France, the UK and the US on February 27.

"Congress manifesto: Congress to vow dwelling place for homeless SCs/STs, OBCs | India News - Times of India","(This story originally appeared in  on Mar 26, 2019)(This article was originally published by The Economic Times on 26/03/2019.) NEW DELHI: Congress intends to promise a farm loan waiver similar to the one the UPA government implemented in 2008 in its manifesto the party working committee finalised on Monday. Universal healthcare, right to land to all homeless Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs, amending Constitution to allow reservation in promotions and passage of women’s reservation bill in Parliament’s first session are some of the other promises. The manifesto also proposes to tap the “great potential” of the farm sector by setting up cold storage plants, food processing industries and farm based industries to provide employment. Any homeless person belonging to SC/ST/OBC would be provided land or a dwelling unit. The Congress has also promised a constitutional amendment to introduce reservation in promotions, considered a political hot potato. Improved representation of Backward Classes in the judiciary is another promise. The manifesto has proposed setting up of a National Law Commission for judicial appointments to introduce transparency and ensure better representation of SCs/STs/OBCs in the judiciary. A universal healthcare scheme and jobs for educated youth would also find a place in the Congress manifesto. It also promises a range of reforms in education, including easy loans, filling vacancies in educational institutions in a year and enhanced scholarships with improved disbursal system to win over the youth. The party has also promised to fill vacancies in government institutions and corporations in a year. The CWC meeting also saw detailed discussions on national security. Aware of the impact of the Balakot air strikes, the Congress manifesto will showcase its commitment to fight terrorism. A ‘balance’ of foreign policy and an ‘iron hand’ in fighting terrorism will be the line the manifesto will take on national security. The manifesto is likely to be released on April 2, eight days ahead of the first phase of polling. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Air strike kills 8 Iraq paramilitaries in east Syria: monitor - Times of India,"BEIRUT: An air strike in eastern Syria killed eight fighters of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force overnight, a war monitor said on Friday. ""Unidentified aircraft targeted vehicles and arms depots in the Albu Kamal area, causing a large explosion. At least eight Iraqi Hashed fighters were killed,"" the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdel Rahman, said. He said several others were wounded. Through a spokesman contacted by AFP, the US-led military coalition operating in Syria and Iraq denied carrying out the strike. Abdel Rahman said three villages in the Albu Kamal area known for housing forces loyal to Tehran have been targeted by drone strikes since Wednesday, causing no casualties. The deadly strike comes in a context of spiralling tension between the United States and Iran, much of which has played out in Iraq. Late last year, a US air strike in Iraq killed 25 hashed fighters from the Kataeb Hezbollah militia, considered one of the closest to Tehran. Hashed supporters subsequently stormed the huge US embassy compound in central Baghdad, further escalating the situation. On January 3, a US strike near Baghdad airport killed Qassim Soleimani, Iran's feared external operations supremo, in one of the Middle East's highest-profile assassinations of recent years. Also killed in the strike was Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a founder of Kataeb Hezbollah and seen as Iran's man in Iraq. Tehran has vowed bloody revenge and has so far responded with ballistic missiles on a base in western Iraq housing US and other coalition troops. Iran claimed the strikes killed 80 people but neither the US nor the Iraqi military reported any casualties. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
Pak stands isolated on world stage post Balakot air strike: Kota | Mangaluru News - Times of India,"Mangaluru: Pakistan stands isolated on the world stage ‘post-surgical strike 2’. A few leaders of ‘Mahagathbandhan’ and intellectuals in India are the only ray of hope for the neighbouring nation, said Kota Srinivas Poojary, leader of the opposition in state legislative council. On the other hand, India’s action in levelling terror camps at Balakot has received global backing from the super powers on its right to defend territorial sovereignty, he said. Addressing reporters on Monday, Poojary said the clamour from disparate voices seeking proof of air strike on Balakot notwithstanding an audio tape admission by Maulana Ammar, brother of JeM chief Masood Azhar that air strikes had taken toll on training centre for jihadis, is misplaced. The political parties seeking proof for the strikes are seeking to politicise the bravery and valour of our armed forces who strike at the enemy, he said. In the same vein, a reported statement of CM H D Kumaraswamy decrying street celebrations following the Balakot air strikes in that it would hurt sentiments of a particular community is also sad, he said. “I can’t believe this statement has come from him,” Poojary said, adding this (statement) is now a sad reality. The CM must take back his words, Poojary demanded, noting that using caste and religious equations for the armed forces is wrong. On PM Krishi Samman Nidhi Yojana, he slammed the tepid reaction of the state government in receiving applications from farmer beneficiaries in Karnataka. Against 76-lakh-odd farmer beneficiaries, the state government thus far has received only 16 lakh beneficiaries, he said, adding the government must extend facility to obtain applications to the grassroots level. If the government fails to do so, BJP reserves the right to launch an agitation, he said. Slamming the election eve announcement of formation of new taluks in Karnataka, Poojary said the state government is yet to provide facilities and transfer government offices to taluks already formed by the previous government. Claiming a mood favouring the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, Poojary advised the Congress to get their doubts regarding EVMs cleared now rather than crib over it once the general elections are over.

" Rahul Gandhi confidant Sam Pitroda questions death toll in Balakot air strike, bats for dialogue with Pakistan | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Close confidant of Rahul Gandhi and chairman of the Overseas Indian National Congress has questioned the death toll in the Balakot airstrike conducted by the Indian Air Force in Pakistan in retaliation to the Pulwama terror attack. ""If they (IAF) killed 300, its ok. All I am saying is can you give me more facts and prove it,"" said Pitroda in a wide-ranging interview to ANI. When asked on his views on the airstrike against the Jaish-e-Mohammad camp in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, he added that international news outlets had an alternate view of the impact of the air strike and that the people of India deserved to know the facts of the Air Force operation. ""I would like to know a little more because I read reports in the New York Times and other newspapers. Did we really attack? We really killed 300 people? I don't know that. As a citizen, I am entitled to know and if I ask it is my duty to ask, that doesn't mean I'm not a nationalist, That doesn't mean I am on this side or that side. We need to know the facts. If you say 300 people were killed, I need to know that. We all need to know that, people of India need to know that and then comes global media which says nobody was killed. I look bad as an Indian citizen,"" said Pitroda. Pitroda, who is part of the Congress's manifesto committee for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and is considered a senior ideologue of the party, sought a dialogue with Pakistan. ""I am a Gandhian, I believe in more compassion and respect. I believe in more dialogues personally. I think we should have a dialogue with everybody. Why just Pakistan? We are having dialogue with the whole world,"" added Pitroda. Pressed further to clarify if talks with Pakistan was an option post the Pulwama terror attack which killed 40 CRPF jawans, Pitroda said that it would be naive to assume that if some people came here and attacked, every citizen of that nation is to be blamed. ""I don't know much about (Pulwama) attack, it happens all the time, attack happen in Mumbai Taj hotel and Oberoi hotel. We could have reacted then and sent our planes but that is not the right approach according to me that's not how you deal with the World. Eight people come (referring to Mumbai 26/11 attacks) and do something, you don't jump on the entire nation,"" said Sam Pitroda in an interview to ANI. When asked if he questioned the Indian Air Force's version of the Balakot air strikes, Pitroda clarified that an attack is different from making a claim of 300 dead. ""We cannot be emotional. Data has to be neutral. So you come in today and say 'I killed 300 people' and I say wait a minute, the World is saying we didn't kill anybody or kill less or kill more.. I don't know,"" added Pitroda. Sam Pitroda added a caveat to his remarks on the Pulwama terror attack and Balakot air strikes by saying that the views expressed by him were his personal views and not those of the Congress party. ""I am talking as an individual. I am talking as a scientist. I believe in reason. I believe in logic. I believe in data. I don't believe in emotions,"" he added.

Pitroda also said that he disagreed with the way PM Modi acted post-Pulwama attack. Pitroda went on to say in the interview that since 2014, a populist government had risen in both India and the United States.

US to Pakistan: Further terror attack on India will be extremely problematic - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The United States has asked Pakistan to take sustained, verifiable and irreversible action against the perpetrators of terrorism, while warning the country that another terror attack on India will prove to be ""extremely problematic"". ""We need to see Pakistan taking concrete and sustained action to reign in the terrorist groups, mainly the Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Lashkar-e-Taiba in order to ensure that we don't have re-escalation (of tension) in the region,"" a senior administration official told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. ""And, if there's any additional terrorist attack without Pakistan having made a sustained, sincere effort against these groups, it would be extremely problematic for Pakistan and it would cause re-escalation of tensions, which is dangerous for both countries,"" the official said on the condition of anonymity. Asked about the steps being taken by Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot air strike by Indian fighter jets, the official said the US and the international community needed to see ""irreversible and sustained"" action against the terror groups. China has responsibility to not shield Pakistan: US""It's early to make a full assessment,"" the official said. In the recent days, the official said Pakistan has taken some ""initial"" actions. They have frozen the assets of some terrorist groups and made some arrests. They have taken administrative control of some of the JeM facilities, the official added. Pakistan constitutes 7-member SC bench to define ‘terrorism’""But we clearly need to see more. We need to see irreversible action because in the past, what we've seen is they made some arrests and then a few months later, they released these individuals. The terrorist leaders are sometimes still allowed to travel around the country, hold rallies,"" the official said. Reiterating that the United States is looking for ""irreversible action"", the official said America is working with its international partners to increase pressure on Pakistan. ""Because it has been too long that these groups have been able to operate."" Observing that Pakistan has economic concerns as well, the official said the Financial Action Tasks Force (FATF) is one area which demonstrates the need for them to take these actions against terror groups. ""Otherwise, they're at risk within the system and the FATF to be grey-listed,"" the official said. Pakistan needs to decide if it wants to be viewed as a responsible international player and have access to all the financial mechanisms that are available or is it going to continue to fail to take the steps necessary against these terrorist groups and see itself further isolated. ""The choice is Pakistan's,"" the senior administration official asserted. While the situation between the two south Asian neighbours have de-escalated, the two armies are still on high alert and that concerns the US, the official said. ""So, we realize that if there, God forbid, would be another terrorist attack that you could quickly see the escalation in the situation once again. So that's why, we're making clear that any additional military action by either side runs an unacceptably high risk, for both countries and for the region,"" the official said. The Trump administration, the official said, has taken sort of a ""zero tolerance policy"" on the issue of safe havens to terrorists. ""The terrorist attack on February 14th on India was a demonstration that Pakistan's continuing provision of sanctuary for any terrorist group is not acceptable,"" the official said. During the height of the crisis -- February 26-28 -- the United States was in continuous contact with Indian and Pakistani officials, both on the ground in New Delhi and Islamabad. ""They were working the phones continuously and were deeply engaged in seeking to deescalate what was a very dangerous moment in India-Pakistan relations,"" the official said. The United States has also reached out to influential countries to have them help deescalate the situation, the senior administration official said. Some of these countries are China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan and Australia.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal targets Amit Shah for ‘lying’ on Balakot strike | Delhi News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday hit out at BJP following party president Amit Shah’s claim that 250 terrorists were killed in the air strikes on terror training camps in Balakot, Pakistan. Kejriwal said Shah’s stand was contradictory to that of the armed forces. Referring to a news report that the purpose of the air strike was to send a message and not to kill, Kejriwal said on Twitter that “Shah is a liar, and lies about the armed forces will not be tolerated in the country.” In tweets in Hindi, Kejriwal said the whole country stands with the armed forces but BJP stands against them. “Are the armed forces lying according to Amit Shah? The Army has categorically stated that there is no clarity on how many died or whether even someone died or not. Are BJP and Amit Shah contradicting the armed forces for political advantages? The country trusts the armed forces. Do the BJP and Amit Shah not trust the armed forces?” Kejriwal tweeted. “The armed forces cannot lie. The BJP is lying. The entire country is with the Army but the BJP is against the armed forces,” Kejriwal added. Indian Air Force has declined to comment on the death toll in the strikes it carried out on a Jaish camp. A couple of days earlier, Kejriwal had taken strong exception to the remarks of BJP leader B S Yeddyurappa that the air strike would win the BJP the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. “How many jawans will you get martyred to win 300 seats? How many families will be destroyed for it? How many women you want to make widows, how many mothers do you want to lose their sons? How many jawans will be sacrificed?” Kejriwal had said in Delhi assembly. Kejriwal had also slammed the BJP for “counting bodies” to win elections. “BJP is counting bodies and comparing it with the seats that they will get in the elections…has the BJP done this at the border for this (winning elections)? The antics of the BJP have angered the entire nation,” Kejriwal had said, adding that he was ashamed of such a government. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"US civil flights banned over Gulf, Iraq, Iran - Times of India","WASHINGTON/MONTREAL: The US Federal Aviation Administration said it would ban US carriers from operating in the airspace over Iraq, Iran, the Gulf of Oman and the waters between Iran and Saudi Arabia after Iran launched a missile attack on US-led forces in Iraq. Tehran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles from Iranian territory against at least two Iraqi military bases hosting US-led coalition personnel, the US military said on Tuesday. The FAA said it issued the airspace ban ""due to heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the Middle East, which present an inadvertent risk to US civil aviation operations."" Several non-US airlines had flights over parts of Iraq and Iran at the time, according to FlightRadar24 data. They are not directly affected by the FAA ban, but foreign carriers and their national regulators typically consider US advice carefully when deciding where to fly. Iran attacks US forces in Iraq in retaliation for killing of General SuleimaniBefore the latest guidance, the FAA had already prohibited US carriers from flying below 26,000 feet over Iraq and from flying over an area of Iranian airspace above the Gulf and Gulf of Oman since Iran shot down a high-altitude US drone last June. Singapore Airlines Ltd said after the attack on US bases in Iraq that all of its flights would be diverted from Iranian airspace. Carriers are increasingly taking steps to limit threats to their planes after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down in 2014 by a missile over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. An international aviation team has been activated to support ""effective coordination and communication"" between airlines and countries as tensions mount in the Middle East after a US drone strike killed an Iranian military commander, global airlines body IATA said on Tuesday. Airlines and the United Nations' aviation agency have started to monitor strategic airspace over Iran and Iraq. With some commercial carriers still serving those countries and others flying over their airspace, the International Air Transport Association also issued a statement reminding countries of their obligation to communicate potential risks to civil aviation. ""It is critical that states live up to this obligation as tensions in the Middle East rise,"" the group said, days after the killing of General Qassem Soleimani on Friday plunged the region into a new crisis. On Monday, Germany published a new warning for Iraq, indicating areas of concern for overflying traffic, according to a report published by the site OPSGROUP. The coordination team operated by IATA and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was activated as a ""standard precautionary measure,"" in the event that contingency measures are required by airlines, IATA said in a statement to Reuters. The team brings together airlines, regulators and air navigation service providers to ensure any potential risks to aviation are shared quickly, an industry source familiar with the group said. ""Everyone's urging restraint,"" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Airspace controlled by Iran and Iraq are seen as strategic for commercial aviation in the Middle East. If there were the need to shut down the airspace, carriers would have to be rerouted which would lead to greater congestion and fuel costs, said the source.

 Election Commission to ask parties afresh not to politicise defence forces | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Mar 19, 2019)(This article was originally published by The Economic Times on 19/03/2019.) NEW DELHI: Days after advising political parties to stop using photos of defence personnel in ads, the Election Commission is preparing to comprehensively counter the larger issue of “politicisation” of defence forces during elections. Highly placed sources told ET that the EC is preparing to write afresh to all parties asking them not to politicise activities related to the defence forces during campaigning. The commission is looking at ways to ensure such instructions are effectively implemented and adhered to by the parties. Ensuring compliance of such advisories is a challenge because instances of violation often involve broadbased cases of political rhetoric and messaging. References to Balakot air strikes and the Indian action on the border are already being made in political speeches. Some leaders have raised concern over the “politicisation” of the forces. The EC also recently shot off a showcause notice to a BJP legislator for a Facebook post with Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s photograph. The EC had also received a representation from former Navy chief Admiral L Ramdas who expressed “dismay and deep concern” over some political parties “using images, uniforms and other examples, showing pictures of the armed forces with political figures, in public spaces, in media, election rallies and so on.” The EC, ET has learnt, is expected to send a fresh communication to all political parties expanding on its first communication on the matter. The EC had issued an advisory to all political parties on March 9, after complaints that BJP advertisements have pictures of Varthaman after the Balakot air strikes.

 US closely following legislation on territorial status of J&amp;K: Official | India News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The US is closely following India's legislation regarding the new territorial status and governance of Jammu and Kashmir, a State Department official said on Wednesday, hours after Pakistan expelled the Indian envoy and downgraded its diplomatic ties. The developments came after the Indian Parliament on Tuesday approved a resolution abrogating special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution and a bill for splitting the state into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. ""The US is closely following India's legislation regarding the new territorial status and governance of Jammu and Kashmir. We note the broader implications of these developments, including the potential for increased instability in the region,"" a State Department spokesperson told PTI. The spokesperson was responding to a question on the situation in the region after Pakistan on Wednesday expelled Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria and downgraded the diplomatic ties with India over what it called New Delhi's ""unilateral and illegal"" move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. On Wednesday, the US had also said there was an ""urgent need"" for dialogue among all actors to reduce tensions and to avoid a potential military escalation in South Asia. The State Department spokesperson said that ""the US calls for calm and restraint by all parties"". Expressing concern over detention of people in Jammu and Kashmir, the spokesperson said, ""We continue to be concerned by reports of detentions and the continued restrictions on the residents of Jammu and Kashmir."" ""We urge respect for individual rights, compliance with legal procedures, and inclusive dialogue with those affected."" The US, the spokesperson said, calls on all parties to maintain peace and stability along the Line of Control, including ""taking firm and resolute steps"" to combat cross-border terrorism. ""We continue to support direct dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir and other issues of concern,"" the spokesperson said. India has maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is its integral part and the issue of withdrawing special status to the state and its bifurcation are strictly internal to the country. Early this year, tensions flared up between India and Pakistan after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) killed 40 CRPF personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district. Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting the biggest JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The next day, Pakistan Air Force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured Indian pilot, who was handed over to India on March 1.

"Pakistan latest news: Balakot camp located on bank of Kunhar river in KPK, also used by Hizbul | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Balakot-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp destroyed by the Indian Air Force Tuesday was located on the bank of the Kunhar river in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan and was also used by the Hizbul Mujahideen terror group, government sources said. The Balakot camp was an important training centre for the JeM and other terror organisations and it had several structures to accommodate terrorist trainees and facilities to train them. Situated on the Kunhar river, the Balakot camp offered possibility of aquatic training to terrorists and housed hundreds of terrorists, the sources said. The camp, 20 kms from the Balakot town, was used for ""battle inoculation"" and its trainers were ex-officers of the Pakistan Army. Several ""inspirational lectures"" were delivered by JeM founder and terror mastermind Masood Azhar and other terrorist leaders on several occasions. Masood Azhar's relatives and cadres were trained at Balakot in advanced weapons and tactics and before the inception of JeM, the camp was also used by the Hizbul Mujahideen, the sources said. In the Balakot camp, the terrorists were imparted the advanced 'Daura-e-Khaas' training in weapons, explosives and field tactics, attack on convoys of security forces, planting and making of IEDs, suicide bombing, rigging vehicles for suicide attacks and survival tactics in high altitudes and extreme-stress situations, they said. The JeM specialises in suicide actions and gives immense importance to religious indoctrination and ideological brainwashing, they said.

Body of Iranian commander Soleimani killed in US strike arrives for burial in southeast Iran - Times of India,"DUBAI: The body of the senior Iranian military commander killed in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq last week has arrived in his home town of Kerman in southeast Iran for burial, the official IRNA news agency said on Tuesday. State TV broadcast live images of thousands of people in the streets of the town, many of them dressed in black, to mourn Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was widely seen as Iran’s second most powerful figure behind Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 80, who wept in grief along with hundreds of thousands of mourners who thronged the streets of Tehran for Soleimani’s funeral on Monday. Khamenei led prayers at the funeral in the Iranian capital, pausing as his voice cracked with emotion. Soleimani, 62, was a national hero even to many who do not consider themselves supporters of Iran’s clerical rulers. He was killed leaving Baghdad airport last Friday. Mourners packed the streets, chanting: “Death to America!” - a show of national unity after anti-government protests in November in which many demonstrators were killed. The crowd, which state media said numbered in the millions, recalled the masses gathered in 1989 for the funeral of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The killing of Soleimani has prompted fears around the world of a broader regional conflict, as well as calls in the U.S. Congress for legislation to keep President Donald Trump from going to war against Iran.

The Sangh Parivar is mobilising its units across Madhya Bharat Prant on national security and the Balakot air strikes as the Ram Janmbhoomi has been pushed to the backburner. Sangh karyakartas have already begun their field exercise through public contact. Sources said that RSS’s ‘NaMo’ campaign, online and offline, is based on its database of more than 10 crore voters in saffron-dominated states. The campaign covers 1 crore voters in MP. The aim is to ensure BJP-led NDA gets at least 300 seats. “Our nation will have elections in the coming months. It is necessary that 100% voters exercise their franchise. The development of nation is possible only by a group that is committed to the unity and integrity of the nation. Therefore, it is our national duty to be alert and to discharge our responsibility in the election process,” RSS deputy Bhaiyyaji Joshi had said at the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha in Gwalior last week. As a part of the strategy, RSS has mobilised its units in all three prants — Madhya Bharat, Malwa and Mahakaushal — in Madhya Pradesh. Letters have been issued to volunteers to highlight security issues. “External forces, with the help of some anti-national elements, are indulging in violent incidents. The attacks on the camps of Army and defence forces, attacks in border areas by Pakistan Army, the recent Pulwama terror attack, are very tragic. Nobody should take our tolerance as a sign of weakness,” said a senior RSS functionary. “The Sangh Parivar has lauded the combined efforts of the NDA government and society against evil forces. It is necessary that the government takes stern action against anti-national forces and people should feel secure. The present government is taking praiseworthy efforts in this direction,” he added. RSS Madhya Bharat publicity in-charge Omprakash Sisodiya said, “There is a clear objective — to encourage voters to exercise their franchise. RSS has clarified its stand on Ram temple and Article 370, which are sub judice. Hence, creating awareness to ensure 100% voting will help society think more for the betterment of the nation.""

"Tens of thousands march in Baghdad to mourn Qassim Suleimani, others killed in US air strike - Times of India","BAGHDAD: Tens of thousands of people marched in Baghdad on Saturday to mourn Iran's military commander Qassim Suleimani and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who were killed in a US air strike that has raised the spectre of wider conflict in the Middle East. Friday's attack, authorised by President Donald Trump, signalled a major escalation in a Middle East ""shadow war"" between Iran and the United States and American allies, mainly Israel and Saudi Arabia. Gholamali Abuhamzeh, a senior commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, said Tehran would punish Americans ""wherever they are in reach"", and raised the prospect of possible attacks on ships in the Gulf. The US Embassy in Baghdad urged American citizens to leave Iraq following the strike at Baghdad airport that killed Qassim Suleimani. Dozens of American employees of foreign oil companies left the southern Iraqi city of Basra on Friday. Close US ally Britain warned its nationals on Saturday to avoid all travel to Iraq, outside the autonomous Kurdistan region, and avoid all but essential travel to Iran. Suleimani, a 62-year-old general, was Tehran's most prominent military commander and - as head of the Quds Force, the foreign arm of the Revolutionary Guards - the architect of Iran's spreading influence in the Middle East. Muhandis was the deputy commander of Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) umbrella body of paramilitary groups. An elaborate, PMF-organised procession to mourn Soleimani, Muhandis and other Iraqis killed in the U.S. strike began in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone. The marchers included many militiamen in uniform for whom Muhandis and Soleimani were inspirational heroes. They waved Iraqi and militia flags. They also carried portraits of both men and plastered them on walls and armoured personnel carriers in the procession. They chanted, ""No No Israel"" and ""No No America"". Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi and Iraqi militia commander Hadi al-Amiri, a close Iran ally and the top candidate to succeed Muhandis, attended. The procession was due to proceed by car to the Shi'ite holy city of Kerbala and end in Najaf, another sacred Shi'ite city where Muhandis and others will be laid to rest. The U.S. strike followed a sharp increase in U.S.-Iranian hostilities in Iraq since last week when pro-Iranian militia attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad following a deadly U.S. air raid on the Kataib Hezbollah militia, founded by Muhandis. A senior Trump administration official said Soleimani had been planning imminent attacks on U.S. personnel across the Middle East. Democratic critics of the Republican president said Trump's order was reckless and that he had raised the risk of more violence in a dangerous region. Soleimani's body will be transferred on Saturday to the southwestern Iranian province of Khuzestan that borders Iraq. Then on Sunday it will be taken to the Shi'ite holy city of Mashhad in the northeast and from there to Tehran and on to his hometown Kerman in the southeast for burial on Tuesday, Iranian state media reported. 'Vital American targets' On Friday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed harsh vengeance against the ""criminals"" who killed Soleimani and said his death would intensify the Islamic Republic's resistance to the United States and Israel. Abuhamzeh, the Revolutionary Guards commander in Kerman province, mentioned a series of possible targets for reprisals including the Gulf waterway through which a significant proportion of shipborne oil is exported to global markets. “The Strait of Hormuz is a vital point for the West and a large number of American destroyers and warships cross there,"" Abuhamzeh was quoted as saying on Friday evening by the semi-official news agency Tasnim. ""Vital American targets in the region have long since been identified by Iran...Some 35 U.S. targets in the region as well as Tel Aviv are within our reach,"" he said, referring to Israel's largest city. 'Revenge on the murderers' In Baghdad, many condemned the U.S. attack, regarding Soleimani as a hero for his role in defeating the Islamic State militant group that had seized wide swathes of north and central Iraq in 2014. ""The broad participation in this procession proves the public's condemnation of America and its allies for their human rights abuses while claiming to fight terrorism,"" said one of the marchers, Ali al-Khatib. ""It is necessary to take revenge on the murderers. The martyrs got the prize they wanted - the prize of martyrdom."" Some Iraqis at first reacted with joy to the U.S. strike only to become quickly fearful of the fall-out, particularly for those involved in months of street protests against the Iranian-backed Baghdad government over alleged misrule and corruption. They said that Soleimani and Muhandis had backed the use of force against unarmed anti-government protesters last year and established militias that demonstrators blame for many of Iraq's social and economic woes. Protesters now worry they could become a target for reprisals from Shi'ite militias, who had been portraying the wave of anti-government demonstrations as a US conspiracy.

 Up to government to decide on release of IAF strike images | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Even as a political battle raged, with Congress demanding the government clarify the accounts on casualties, and BJP countering, asking why the opposition was doubting the armed forces, television channels on Wednesday played yet another set of satellite images claiming that the targets at the Jaish terror camp had been hit. The images showed areas that were identified as blast impact sites where vegetation was allegedly damaged. The TV reports claimed that this was the result of the blasts at the buildings that were hit. It was also alleged that the bodies of terrorists at the camp might have been buried at the site to hide evidence and there were efforts to rebuild the roofs. Indian government sources have previously said the attack did not target the entire Jaish campus, but only 5-6 specific buildings. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa has said the designated targets were hit even as he did not offer an estimate of how many persons may have died. So far, though representatives of foreign media have visited Balakot and some accounts had residents claiming that there had been few or no casualties, no one has been allowed at the camp itself that is near Balakot on a hilltop. Some journalists have reported that locals have spoken of a few dozen bodies being removed from the area. The IAF is sticking to its stand that it hit the intended targets in pre-dawn strikes on February 26. “The bombs, which were pre-loaded with satellite images and geographical coordinates of the JeM facility, pierced the roofs of the targeted buildings and exploded inside. The inmates would have been killed by the blast and shock waves,” a source said. Rejecting commercially available satellite imagery being used by some experts to claim there was no major visible external damage to the facility, IAF sources said it was up to the government to decide whether it wanted to release the SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and other pictures captured by Indian surveillance platforms. The Reuters report said, “Lewis and Dave Schmerler, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation studies who also analyses satellite images, said weapons that large would have caused obvious damage to the structures visible in the picture.” It then quoted Lewis saying, “If the strike had been successful, given the information we have about what kind of munitions were used, I would expect to see signs that the buildings had been damaged.

New air strike on pro-Iran convoy in Iraq ahead of General Soleimani's funeral - Times of India,"BAGHDAD: A fresh air strike hit pro-Iran fighters in Iraq early Saturday, as fears grew of a proxy war erupting between Washington and Tehran a day after an American drone strike killed a top Iranian general. It came hours ahead of a planned mourning march for Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary heavyweight Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, slain in a precision drone strike by the US in Baghdad on Friday. The assassination was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Iran and the US, which pledged to send more troops to the region even as US President Donald Trump insisted he did not want war. The killing was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between the US and Iran, which Iraqis fear could play out in their homeland. Almost exactly 24 hours later, a new strike targeted a convoy belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi paramilitary network whose Shia-majority factions have close ties to Iran, the group said in a statement. It did not say who was responsible but Iraqi state television reported it was a US air strike. A police source told AFP the bombardment north of Baghdad left ""dead and wounded,"" without providing a specific toll. There was no immediate comment from the US. The assassination of Soleimani, who had led the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' foreign operations branch and was Iran's pointman on Iraq, rattled the region. US officials said the 62-year-old, who had been blacklisted by the US, was killed when a drone hit his vehicle near Baghdad's international airport. A total of five Revolutionary Guards and five Hashed members were killed in the strike. Their bodies were to be taken through an elaborate mourning procession on Saturday, beginning with a state funeral in Baghdad and ending in the holy shrine city of Najaf. The bodies of the Guards would then be sent to Iran, which had declared three days of mourning for Soleimani. Tehran has already named Soleimani's deputy, Esmail Qaani, to succeed him.

 'Hafiz ji' comment was pun; video should be shown in entirety: Ravi Shankar Prasad | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Under attack by the opposition over his 'Hafiz ji' comment, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad Tuesday said his one-year-old statement was kind of a pun and it should be seen in its full context of the video, where he had slammed terrorists. A day after the BJP targeted Congress president Rahul Gandhi for referring to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as 'Masood Azhar ji', the Congress put out a video of Prasad referring Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed as 'Hafiz ji'. Speaking at a Times Network event here, Prasad said, ""You have to show that one-year-old video of mine in its entirety. The day we exposed Hafiz Saeed in our press conference... and showed video of that terrorist and killer. I said it in 'vyang' (satire). I say they are murderers and killers and terrorist and we will continue to expose them...It was kind of pun"". When asked about his statement being described as a pun while the remark by Gandhi becoming a subject of BJP's attack, Prasad said that his remark should be seen in the totality. ""I would earnestly request... please show my entire press conference of that day, then you will see how belligerent and blistering I was against the terrorists,"" Prasad, who is in charge of IT and Law ministries, said. ""Show that video... Our commitment to India, and commitment to fight against terrorism is complete. We don't make a political bargain of it. It is our commitment that India should become a global power in the fight against terrorism and also in the field of economic, digital and other sectors,"" he said. On Monday, Prasad criticised Gandhi for calling Masood Azhar ""ji"". ""Come on Rahul Gandhi Ji! Earlier it were the likes of Digvijay Ji who called Osama Ji and Hafiz Saeed Sahab. Now you are saying Masood Azhar Ji. What is happening to Congress Party?,"" Prasad had tweeted. On Tuesday, Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi shared a video of the minister referring to terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed as ""Hafiz ji"". At the event Tuesday, Prasad continued his attack on Gandhi and the Congress party. ""When evidence is being sought on whether the Balakot attack has happened or not... You are seeking to disbelieve the narrative of India and, wittingly or unwittingly, you are seeking to weaken the morale of forces of India. Surely, those questions will be asked,"" he said. Asked about Priyanka Gandhi's statement that BJP was raising useless issue like Balakot when the real issues are unemployment and demonetisation, Prasad said, ""This is a question that country should understand. If she says Pulwama is a useless issue, is terrorist attack really a useless issue? That 40 CRPF jawans were killed is that 'fizool' (useless)?"". ""Distinction under Modi government is that we have given a clear message to terrorists that if you commit terrorism against India you have to pay the price... After 1971, for the first time our forces crossed border inside Pakistan. That is the message. If Priyanka ji considers that useless what can I say,"" the minister said. He said the Indian economy is attracting the biggest FDI in the world and had transformed into the biggest electronics manufacturing hub. ""Is it fizool to her?,"" he quipped. Prasad said India is rising and emerging as a world power on the back of transformative reforms like GST. On the issue of demonetisation, he said, ""I want to say when such (black money holders) people are caught Congress has a problem"". To a question on the BJP website being down after being hacked, Prasad said the information was wrong and the website was hacked for a few minutes. Asked when the website will be back, he said: ""We are operational"". ""There are certain rogue element in the world. It also happened in America for sometime, also in China. There are certain people in Pakistan. We keep fighting that. ""On a national highway there are accidents. Should we stop making national or information highways then? You must fasten your seat belts tight. You must maintain speed limit.

BJP garnered maximum service votes in hills | Dehradun News - Times of India,"DEHRADUN: Call it the effect of the surgical strike after the Balakot terror attack or the implementation of the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme, the BJP could sway a number of service voters in the Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh in this election. Among the constituencies where BJP got the maximum votes from the defence fraternity across the country were Pauri Garhwal (19,367 out of 34,433), Almora (14,196 out of 28,718) and Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh (13,880 out of 24,214) as per data available on the Election Commission website.

Rajasthan election results: Balakot strike swings votes in BJP’s favour | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: The Balakot airstrike after the Pulwama attack appears to have worked in BJP’s favour especially in Barmer, Jodhpur, Sikar and Jhunjhunu with large population of defence personnel voting for BJP. While the BJP candidates themselves did not highlight Balakot during their campaigns, Modi spoke about it extensively in all the rallies. The concepts of ‘nationalism’ and ‘standing with the soldiers’ translated into votes for BJP with Modi emphasising on them in almost every speech. However, the voters in these and some other constituencies lamented that just Balakot did not decide the votes but rather enhanced the issue of national security. “The votes went to BJP because they took decisive actions for national security in the last five years which includes Balakot airstrike. Previously also the party carried out surgical strikes in 2016 to ensure high levels of national security. As voters, we had belief that in case there is a threat from external forces, the government will take concrete defensive measures,” said Tanay Singh, a native of Kirdoli in Sikar which has a large population of armed force personnel. While the Pulwama attack remains fresh in the memory of voters, the Balakot airstrikes have also been given similar importance. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
"Qassem Soleimani was Iran's celebrity soldier, spearhead in Middle East - Times of India","Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, the top commander of the elite Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, helped Iran fight proxy wars across the Middle East by inspiring militias on the battlefield and negotiating with political leaders. His death on Friday in a U.S. air strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport marked the end of a man who was a celebrity at home and closely watched by the United States, Israel and Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon said the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. Soleimani was responsible for clandestine overseas operations and was often seen on battlefields guiding Iraqi Shi'ite groups in the war against Islamic State. He was killed along with top Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Both men were seen as heroes in Iran's fight against its enemies and state television heaped them with praise shortly after their deaths were announced. The television showed footage of him with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and in war zones in military garb, including as a young high-school graduate commanding a unit in Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s. After that, he rose rapidly through the ranks of Iran's Revolutionary Guards to become chief of the Quds Force, a post in which he helped Iran form alliances in the Middle East as it came under pressure from U.S. sanctions that have devastated the Islamic Republic's economy. The United States designated the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization in 2019, part of a campaign of maximum pressure to force Iran to negotiate on its ballistic missile program and nuclear policy. Soleimani had a pointed reply: any negotiation with the U.S. would be ""complete surrender."" Soleimani's Quds Force shored up support for Syrian President Bashir al-Assad when he looked close to defeat in the civil war raging since 2011 and also helped militiamen defeat Islamic State in Iraq. Its successes have made Soleimani instrumental to the steady spreading of Iran's clout in the Middle East, which the United States and Tehran's regional foes Saudi Arabia and Israel have struggled to keep in check. Khamenei made Soleimani head of the Quds Force in 1998, a position in which he kept a low profile for years while he strengthened Iran’s ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad's government, and Shi’ite militia groups in Iraq. In the past few years, he has acquired a more public standing, with fighters and commanders in Iraq and Syria posting images on social media of him on the battlefield, his beard and hair always impeccably trimmed. ""WE ARE CLOSE TO YOU""Soleimani's growing authority within Iran's military establishment was apparent in 2019 when Khamenei awarded him the Order of Zolfiqar medal, Iran's highest military honour. It was the first time any commander had received the medal since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. In a statement after Soleimani's death, Khamenei said harsh revenge awaited the ""criminals"" who killed him. His death, though bitter, would double the motivation of the resistance against the United States and Israel, the Iranian leader said. ""Soleimani is ... not a man working in an office. He goes to the front to inspect the troops and see the fighting,"" a former senior Iraqi official, who asked not to be identified, said in an interview in 2014. ""His chain of command is only the Supreme Leader. He needs money, gets money. Needs munitions, gets munitions. Needs material, gets material,"" the former Iraqi official said. Soleimani was also in charge of intelligence gathering and covert military operations carried out by the Quds Force and in 2018 he publicly challenged U.S. President Donald Trump. ""I’m telling you Mr. Trump the gambler, I’m telling you, know that we are close to you in that place you don’t think we are,"" said Soleimani, seen wagging an admonishing finger in a video clip distributed online. ""You will start the war but we will end it,"" he said, with a checkered keffiya draped across the shoulders of his olive uniform. ""GETS WHAT HE WANTS""Softly-spoken, Soleimani came from humble beginnings, born into an agricultural family in the town of Rabor in southeast Iran on March 11, 1957. At 13, he travelled to the town of Kerman and got a construction job to help his father pay back loans, according to a first person account from Soleimani posted by Defa Press, a site focused on the history of Iran’s eight year war with Iraq. When the revolution to oust the Shah began in 1978, Soleimani was working for the municipal water department in Kerman and organised demonstrations against the monarch. He volunteered for the Revolutionary Guards and, after war with Iraq broke out in 1980, quickly rose through the ranks and went on to battle drug smugglers on the border with Afghanistan. ""Soleimani is a great listener. He does not impose himself. But he always gets what he wants,"" said another Iraqi official, adding that he can be intimidating. At the height of the civil war between Sunni and Shi’ite militants in Iraq in 2007, the U.S. military accused the Quds Force of supplying improvised explosive devices to Shi’ite militants which led to the death of many American soldiers. Soleimani played such a pivotal role in Iraq’s security through various militia groups that General David Petraeus, the overall head of U.S. forces in Iraq at the time, sent messages to him through Iraqi officials, according to diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks. After a referendum on independence in the Kurdish north in 2017, Soleimani issued a warning to Kurdish leaders which led to a withdrawal of fighters from contested areas and allowed central government forces to reassert their control. He was arguably even more influential in Syria. His visit to Moscow in the summer of 2015 was the first step in planning for a Russian military intervention that reshaped the Syrian war and forged a new Iranian-Russian alliance in support of Assad. His activities had made him a repeated target of the U.S. Treasury: Soleimani was sanctioned by the United States for the Quds Force's support for Lebanon's Hezbollah and other armed groups, for his role in Syria’s crackdown against protesters and his alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States. Soleimani’s success in advancing Iran’s agenda had also put him in the crosshairs of regional foes Saudi Arabia and Israel. Top Saudi intelligence officials looked into the possibility of assassinating Soleimani in 2017, according to a report in the New York Times in 2018. A Saudi government spokesman declined to comment, the Times reported, but Israeli military officials publicly discussed the possibility of targeting him.

2019 LS elections:   Will air strikes help Narendra Modi? This is how wars have impacted govts | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: As India faces Lok Sabha elections from April 11 to May 19 in seven phases, the Pulwama terror attack and the following air strike by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in Pakistan’s Balakot is being touted to help boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s chances to retain power. This may be true to only some extent if history is to be believed. Before the February air strikes on Pakistan followed by the April-May Lok Sabha elections, India had faced similar situations on three occasions - the 1967 Lok Sabha elections after the 1962 India-China war and 1965 India-Pakistan battle, the 1977 Lok Sabha elections after the 1971 India-Pakistan war and the 1999 Lok Sabha elections after the Kargil war. However, only the 1999 Lok Sabha elections after the Kargil war come closest to this year’s general elections which are being held under the shadow of the February 26 air strikes in Balakot. The reason is the gap between the wars and the next Lok Sabha election. The performance of the ruling party before and after the war gives an insight into the impact the military engagement had on the following Lok Sabha elections. 1962 India-China war & 1965 India-Pakistan warLet us take the 1962 India-China and 1965 India-Pakistan wars first. The 1962 Lok Sabha elections had taken place in February. The Congress, led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, was already in power. Out of 543, the Congress fielded candidates on 488 constituencies. It registered about 74 per cent victory with 361 of its candidates winning elections. The party garnered 44.72 per cent of the votes polled. The India-China war took place in October and November the same year. This was followed by the India-Pakistan war in 1965. The next Lok Sabha election was held two years later in 1967. The Congress’s performance deteriorated as compared with that in 1962. The ruling Congress fielded candidates on 516 seats. At 54.84 per cent strike rate, 283 candidates registered victory. The party’s vote share also came down to 40.78 per cent. 1971 India-Pakistan Bangladesh warThe war took place in December 1971 when Indira Gandhi was the prime minister while the Lok Sabha elections had already been held in March. The next election after the 1971 war took place in 1977. During the interregnum, Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency and her government got defamed. The 1977 Lok Sabha election saw the crushing defeat of the Congress and coming to power of the Janata Party led by Morarji Desai. The Bangladesh war, which had taken six years ago, failed to have any impact on the elections. 1999 Kargil warNext came the Kargil conflict. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led 24-party National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had formed government with Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the prime minister in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections. However, the AIADMK led by J Jayalalithaa withdrew support to the Vajpayee government on April 14. In the confidence vote that took place on April 17, Vajpayee lost by just one vote. Subsequently, then President KR Narayanan dissolved the Lok Sabha on 26 April and called for early elections with Vajpayee as the caretaker PM. The Election Commission announced the Lok Sabha election schedule on May 4. However, barely a week after the announcement of the poll schedule, India learnt about Pakistani infiltrators having taken position in Kargil. Operation Vijay to flush out the infiltrators from the peaks of Kargil was undertaken for more than two months. Finally, on July 26, 1999, India declared victory and the day is celebrated as Kargil Vijay. The Lok Sabha elections were held in two phases - on September 5 and October 3 - while the counting of votes took place on October 6. All this while, Vajpayee remained as the caretaker PM. The Kargil war, which had taken about two months before the Lok Sabha elections, seems to have an impact on the results. The Vajpayee government was voted out of power in April, albeit by one vote. Then Congress president Sonia Gandhi also could not muster the magic number of 272. In the 1998 Lok Sabha election, the BJP contested on 388 seats and won 182. The Congress contested 477 seats and won 141. In the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP again got 182 seats though it had contested on lesser number of seats. On the other hand, the Congress’s performance registered a worse performance than in 1998. Out of the 453 seats it contested, it won 114 won, 68 less than the BJP. This gap was less in 1998 - just 41 seats. However, with the help of its allies and their better performance, the BJP formed the government again in 1999, with Vajpayee as the PM. Either the Kargil victory did not help the Vajpayee government or it helped marginally but crucially. Had there been no Kargil war, the Vajpayee government might have failed to form government. Almost like the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, which were held about 40 days after the Kargil Victory Day, this year’s elections are being held after 43 days of the air strikes. The air strikes, also called ‘Surgical Strikes 2.0’, may either not help the Narendra Modi government. Or, if it does, it may just be marginal as had happened with Vajpayee after the Kargil war in 1999. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Pak air traffic controller saves Jaipur-Muscat flight after pilot sounds alert - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: An air traffic controller from Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority saved a plane flying from Jaipur to Muscat, the capital city of Oman, after its pilot sounded alert due to bad weather. Sources in the aviation authority have said that the plane encountered abnormal weather conditions near the Chor area of the southern Sindh province. According to a report in The News International, the plane, carrying 150 passengers, was flying over Karachi region on Thursday when it got caught in the middle of lightning and dropped down from an altitude of 36,000 feet to 34,000 feet almost immediately. As a result, the pilot initiated emergency protocol and broadcast ""Mayday"" to nearby stations. The air traffic controller from Pakistan responded to the call of pilot and directed it through the dense air traffic in the vicinity for the remaining journey in the Pakistani airspace. Pakistan on July 16 opened its airspace for India after some five months of restrictions imposed in the wake of a standoff with New Delhi earlier this year. Following the Balakot airstrikes, Pakistan had closed its airspace on February 26. Pakistan last month denied India's request to allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi's VVIP flight to use its airspace for his visit to Saudi Arabia over the Kashmir issue. Pakistan downgraded diplomatic relations with India after New Delhi on August 5 revoked special status given to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into two Union territories.

" British NSA Mark Sedwill speaks to Ajit Doval, offers all assistance to deal with terrorism | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: National security adviser of the United Kingdom Mark Sedwill on Thursday spoke to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval and offered all assistance, including intelligence-sharing, in dealing with any form of terrorism, official sources said. Sedwill also expressed solidarity with India in the aftermath of the Pulwama terrorist attack, they said, adding the call was initiated by the British NSA. The British NSA said all assistance in dealing with any form of terrorism will be extended to India bilaterally through counter-terrorism cooperation, intelligence-sharing and by bringing the perpetrators of terrorist attacks to justice, the sources added. The telephonic conversation between the two NSAs came amid heightened tension between India and Pakistan triggered by the Pulwama attack. The Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility of the strike in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. On February 26, Indian Air Force combat jets struck JeM's biggest terrorist training camp in Balakot deep inside Pakistan.

"ISRO Chandrayaan 2: How response of opposition parties was different after surgical, Balakot strikes | India News - Times of India","Cutting across ideologies, political parties supported Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) after its Chandrayaan-2 mission failed to meet its cent per cent expectation on early hours of September 7. However, they were not similarly united in backing the armed forces even though the latter had claimed to have returned after killing terrorists and destroyed their launch pads in Pakistan and the portion of Kashmir occupied by the neighbouring country. While the politicians of different political parties consoled Isro and its chairperson K Sivan, they had demanded proof from the Army and the Air Force of the September 2016 surgical strikes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and the February 26 air strikes in Balakot, Pakistan. The politicians had also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP of politicising the surgical strikes and the air strikes. However, they have not yet made similar charges against them so far even though similar circumstances have existed. PM Modi visited the Isro control centre before the scientists were supposed to attempt to land Vikram lander on the Moon. He remained there till Isro chairperson K Sivan announced that Vikram lander had gone incommunicado. Narendra Modi returned to the Isro centre in the morning to address the scientists and boost their morale. He was seen embracing and comforting a distraught Sivan who had broken down. While addressing an election rally in Haryana a day later on September 8, Modi talked about the Chandrayaan-2 incident and said how the country exhibited “Isro spirit” by uniting during the 100 seconds at 1.50 am when Isro had lost contact with Vikram lander. Despite these, the opposition is yet to accuse the PM of politicising Chandrayaan-2 as they had done for surgical and air strikes. However, there is a slight difference between Chandrayaan-2 and the military operations against Pakistan. While the former was being witnessed live, the latter two exercises did not have proofs. This is how various prominent opposition leaders responded to different situations differently. Chandrayaan-2After Vikram lander went incommunicado at 1.50 am on September 7, Congress president Sonia Gandhi applauded the entire team of space scientists and researchers at Isro for their “incredible and praiseworthy efforts” on the Chandrayaan-2 mission. “Chandrayaan-2’s journey may take us slightly longer but Isro’s history is replete with examples of their determination in the face of seemingly hopeless odds. They never give up. I have no doubt that we will get there, if not today, then tomorrow; together as a nation,” she said. Her son and predecessor Rahul Gandhi too hailed Isro and sought to boost the morale of the scientists. In a tweet, he said, “Congratulations to the team at Isro for their incredible work on the Chandrayaan-2 Moon mission. Your passion and dedication is an inspiration to every Indian. Your work is not in vain. It has laid the foundation for many more path breaking and ambitious Indian space missions.” Congratulations to the team at #ISRO for their incredible work on the Chandrayaan 2 Moon Mission. Your passion & de… https://t.co/Dhiu0hmix4— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) 1567805450000Sonia Gandhi’s daughter and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra expressed pride for each and everyone in the Isro team. “Setbacks are a part of the journey. Without them, there is no success. The whole nation stands with you and believes in you,” she tweeted. Proud of each and everyone on the #ISRO team. Setbacks are a part of the journey; without them, there is no success… https://t.co/lhHRj8UHhz— Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) 1567835465000However, the reaction of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav were different before and after the Chandrayaan-2 setback. On September 6, Mamata Banerjee criticised the BJP for “taking the credit” of Chandrayaan-2 Moon mission. ""Suddenly, today he (Narendra Modi) has gone there (at the Isro headquarters in Bangalore)... Now for the next four days the issue of Chandrayaan will continue to dominate. As if they (the BJP) have done everything in the country. (As if) they have invented science ...,"" she said. The same day, Akhilesh Yadav said they would not only see the Moon that night but would also witness on the Moon the result of the relentless dedication of the Indian scientists who had devoted 50 years of hard work. Wishing Isro the best, he hit out at the BJP ruling Uttar Pradesh and the Centre and said, “Hope that along with this historic space achievement, the country will also be free from the present day violence and corruption which is a ground reality.” But the tone and tenor of both Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav changed after the fiasco. Mamata said, “We are proud of our scientists. The Isro team worked hard for Chandrayaan-2... My sincere gratitude and congratulations to Isro. We are all with you. May you continue to make us proud!” On his part, Akhilesh said, “Today we made the way. We will reach the destination also tomorrow. This is the effort of high morale. It will definitely be successful one day.” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was also forthcoming in his words of praise for Isro scientists. “They have created history. No need to lose heart. Our scientists have done a great job. Jai Hind!” he said. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati profusely hailed the Isro scientists. “The Chandrayaan-2 mission of stepping on the Moon has enthused all Indians... Also, in order to keep moving forward, it is necessary not to feel despair and grieve at all. It is also worth noting that only warriors fall in battles whereas infants who crawl on their knees do not fall. Scientists need to be encouraged to keep working in the national interest,” she said. Surgical strikes and Balakot air strikesHowever, the response of the same leaders was not the same after the surgical strikes and the Balakot air strikes. Rahul Gandhi, who was Congress vice-president then, had hailed PM Narendra Modi in his first reaction to the surgical strikes of September 29, 2016. He said Modi had done his first good work as PM. However, within a week he changed his stance and accused Modi of indulging in “khoon ki dalali” (trading in the blood of soldiers). Rahul Gandhi, as the then Congress president, was equally critical of Narendra Modi after the Balakot air strikes. Sarcastically, he said, “The prime minister says he did it. You (PM Modi) did it? Could you please show (us) how to hold a rifle? Hold a rifle, the way our CRPF men do, for just five minutes… Or travel in a bus alone in Jammu and Kashmir. Show us. You did the air strikes? What did you do? The Air Force carried out the bombing… It is Narendra Modi who did it (the air strike). He did it sitting on Race Course Road (now Lok Kalyan Marg, where the prime minister’s official residence is located).” The Congress also started competing with the Modi government and said its government had also conducted several surgical strikes but did not make them public. The party lashed out at the BJP for “politicising” the military exercises. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal made ambiguous comments after the surgical strikes. He released a video in which he first congratulated Modi. But towards the end, he said Pakistan was indulging in false propaganda and asked the PM to counter the neighbouring country. His comments were seen as demanding proofs of the surgical strikes and Pakistan used his remarks to mock Modi. After the Balakot air strikes, Arvind Kejriwal hit out at the then BJP president Amit Shah for claiming that 250 terrorists were killed in the military exercise while the armed forces did not comment on the number of terrorists killed in the operation. Kejriwal accused Shah of lying as his statement was contradictory to that of the armed forces. Much like Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati initially praised both the surgical strikes and air strikes. However, she made a volte face within a few days. While she called the surgical strikes as “drama”, she demanded Modi to specify the number of terrorists killed in Balakot air strikes. The Samajwadi Party’s response to the surgical strikes and the air strikes were different. It tried to take a portion of credit for the surgical strikes claiming that the prime minister had acted on the advice of “Netaji” (Lok Sabha MP Mulayam Singh Yadav). However, Akhilesh Yadav criticised Modi and alleged that he was seeking votes in the name of the Balakot operation. Though the opposition leaders have not accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of politicising the Chandrayaan-2 Moon mission, it may be too early to predict their next move. After all, they had changed their position on surgical strikes and air strikes about a week later. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Not a game of marbles: V K Singh on opposition demand for proof of air strikes | India News - Times of India,"RANCHI: Union minister VK Singh on Tuesday trashed Congress demand for proof on the Balakot terror strikes as ""waste of time"" and on the opposition party's quest regarding casualty figures, he said it was not a ""game of marbles"". The minister of state for external affairs said no proof is given about action by the forces and asked whether anybody had got proof during wars since 1947. Seeking to put the government on the back foot, opposition parties had on Monday latched on to BJP chief Amit Shah's claim of 250 casualties in the Indian Air Force's air strike in Pakistan's Balakot to ask how he got such top secret information. On the varying casualty figures in the Balakot strikes, Singh told reporters, ""One way is to go there and count and come back. Secondly, what the information you have, you can assess it (figure) and that number is told to the people. Exact figure will be known only when you are there. ""This is not a game of marbles. This is a serious matter. Any action by the forces, no proof is given,"" he asserted. Asked about his reaction on Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh describing the February 14 Pulwama terror attacks an ""accident"", the former Army chief said, ""With due respect, I would like to ask Digvijaya Singh, whether Rajiv Gandhi's killing was a terror act or an accident?""

We have never taken such a decision since 1947, going deep inside (striking in Pakistan), which is a big decision. It showed India's state of mind in the fight against terrorism. A big decisive turn has come and has come under a leadership, he said. The MoS, who is here to interact with different sections of people to include their desires and thoughts in the BJP's poll manifesto, dismissed Congress leaders Kapil Sibal and Digvijay Singh's demand for proof on the Balakot strikes as ""valueless and waste of time"".  Sibal had on Monday cited international media claiming there was no proof of militant losses at Balakot in Pakistan and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi must answer. To a query on PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti making a jibe at Air India's 'Jai Hind' order, the former Army chief said he never trusted the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister as he knew her when he was posted in Srinagar and Avantipur in 2004 and 2006. ""Neither believe her nor take her seriously,"" Singh said. An official advisory of the national carrier had on Monday said that Air India crew will have to say ""Jai Hind"" after every flight announcement ""with much fervour"". Reacting on the news, Mehbooba Tuesday tweeted, ""Little surprise that with general elections around the corner, the josh of patriotism hasn't even spared the skies."" Citing how America was 'united' when Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was killed, Singh said, ""Such unison produces the required impact as the enemy will try not to talk in unison. So, we want that the entire country should be united. ""I felt the whole country was united (post Pulwama and Balakot air strike).

 Naxalism flourishes whenever Congress comes to power: Amit Shah | India News - Times of India,"RAIPUR: BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday said Naxalism flourishes whenever Congress comes to power, but the menace weakens whenever the party does not rule. Shah, while addressing a convention of the BJP's booth-level workers here, also said that the air strike by Indian armed forces has sent out a message to the world that no one can violate India's borders. ""When Naxalism took birth in West Bengal, Congress was in power there. Similarly, when Naxalism flourished in Andhra Pradesh, Congress was in power and the same party was ruling, when the menace entered Chhattisgarh,"" Shah said. In these states, Naxalism weakened after the Congress moved out of power, he said. ""In Chhattisgarh, after the Raman Singh government came to power, Naxalism vanished. Whenever the Congress comes to power, Naxalism flourishes and whenever it goes out of power, the menace weakens. What is the relation the Congress has with Naxals?"" he asked. ""When anti-national slogans were raised at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the Congress president had stood in their support which shows his commitment,"" he added. ""Rahul Gandhi used to ask what Narendra Modi government has done. What the Congress did not do in 55 years of its rule in the country, we did in 55 months. The biggest work our government has done is to safeguard our borders."" ""In the 10 years of Sonia-Manmohan rule, anybody infiltrated Indian borders from Pakistan and chopped off heads of our soldiers and insulted them, but there was nobody to give a reply,"" he said. ""We conducted a surgical strike after Uri (attack). After Pulwama, India conducted the air strike and demolished terror camps in Pakistan. It is the Narendra Modi government which has done this. After the air strike, a message was sent to the world that no one can violate the India's borders. The BJP has shown to the world how a strong nation can be built,"" he said. ""Before the surgical strike and the air strike, only two nations were there in the world which had avenged the death of their soldiers.

Last week after the Indian Air Force struck a Jaish-e-Mohammad camp in Balakot, PM Modi had said, ""Rafale fighters could have delivered even better results"". His reference was apparently to the stealth of Rafale, an air-dominance aircraft. The Indian Air Force had deployed a dozen Mirage-2000 aircraft to hit the target. Earlier in the rally, laying out the achievements of his government, the PM said, ""Drinking water was the biggest problem in Gujarat, seven years out of 10 were drought hit and the government was spending it's energy to get water.

"Pakistan questions strike, but says will hit back - Times of India","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday vowed to respond to Indian airstrikes in its territory “at the time and place of our choosing” even as it dismissed India’s claim of targeting the Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Balakot, saying there was no loss of life or property. Director-general of Pakistani army’s Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major General Asif Ghafoor, denied reports that Indian Air Force jets were in Pakistani airspace for 21 minutes and challenged Indian jets to “spend 21 minutes in Pakistani airspace”. Ghafoor said the Indian jets did cross the Line of Control, but they were challenged by the Pakistani side. “For four minutes, they were seen coming towards LoC and when challenged, they were seen going back,” he said. Denying media reports that 350 terrorists were killed in the strike at the Jaish hub in Balakot, the ISPR chief said: “Not even a single brick or debris is present there. They are claiming 350 deaths. But even if there had been 10 casualties, there would have been blood, funeral prayers, injuries, etc.” He added that Pakistani army wanted to take journalists to the spot on Tuesday, but could not do so due to bad weather. The ISPR now plans to take journalists to the site on Wednesday. Elaborating on the Indian jets crossing the LoC, the army spokesperson said: “The Indian jets entered from Kashmir’s Tangdhar. They were timely and effectively challenged, and repulsed by the Pakistani Air Force. On their way back, they jettisoned their payload. Four of their bombs fell in Balakot’s Jabba area and they went back.” He said Pakistani radars had been observing Indian jets on Monday night. “They had earlier come close to our border but did not cross it. Their first visibility was observed near the Sialkot and Lahore border. They were seen approaching the border. Our combat air patrol team... challenged them. They did not cross,” he said. Warning of a Pakistani response to India, Ghafoor said: “We will surprise you. Wait for that surprise. I said that our response will be different. See it for yourself. The response will come, and the response will come differently.” Local residents and journalists at Balakot said they heard sounds of fighter jets at 3:00 am which was followed by thundering explosions in the Jabba area of Mansehra district in Pakistan’s north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

 IAF prepared to fight at short notice: Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force is prepared to fight at ""short notice"" and is fully ready to respond to any terror strike from Pakistan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria said on Friday. The IAF chief described as ""new threat"" the dropping of consignments of weapons by drones in border areas of Punjab allegedly by Pakistan-based terror groups and vowed to take ""action"" to deal with incidents of airspace violation. At a press conference, Bhadauria also said IAF is monitoring development of military infrastructure by China along the Tibetan region, noting that it was not an issue of great concern. ""The IAF is prepared to fight at short notice in full synergy with the other two sister services... Our operational preparedness has been of a very high order,"" he said. He said the IAF has achieved a number of operational milestones during the last one year including the strikes on a terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot. ""While we are proud of our past, we do not rest on our past laurels. Our primary focus is to continue to build and maintain effective air power for the future,"" he said. Bhadauria reiterated that India shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter aircraft in the aerial engagement on February 27 while losing a MiG-21. Pakistan has been denying that India shot down one of its F-16 jets. Asked whether the IAF was ready for another Balakot-type strike, the Air Chief Marshal said any terror activity or strike from Pakistan would be responded to according to government's directive. ""Whatever be the targets, they will be taken care off,"" he said. Asked whether Pakistan would be able to block IAF's communication network in future, he said necessary infrastructure has been put in place to ensure safe radio communication. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who downed the Pakistani F-16, could not hear radio messages during the aerial combat on February 27 as the communication was jammed by Pakistan. Minutes later his MiG 21 Bison was hit and he was held captive in Pakistan for three days. ""They will not be able to hear and jam our communication network,"" said the Air Chief. On reports that the terrorist training camp in Balakot has been ""reactivated"", he said, ""If we had not carried out the Balakot strikes, then the level of activities would have been in greater intensity."" When asked about incidents of Pakistani terror groups dropping arms in Punjab border using drones, he said, ""I would not say it is a very serious threat. It is a new threat. It is not something which we had not anticipated. Some measures were taken already to deal with the situation."" ""It is an issue of airspace violation and necessary steps will be taken... Action has been initiated,"" Bhadauria added. On China building helipads and other military infrastructure along the border, he said IAF is monitoring their infrastructure development. ""We are working on our own infrastructure. It is not an issue of some great concern. We know exactly what is happening,"" he added. The IAF Chief said the induction of new generation combat aircraft and lethal precision weapons will provide the force with an overwhelming offensive capability to deter and punish the enemy. ""Our air defence network has also been strengthened by the induction and integration of modern sensors and weapon systems.

US must ensure tensions between India and Pakistan dont go out of control: Former American diplomat Albright - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The US needs to figure out some way to make sure that there is no nuclear confrontation between Pakistan and India, a former top American diplomat said. Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan after the February 14 Pulwama attack claimed by Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). Forty CRPF soldiers were killed in the attack. India carried out air strikes against the biggest training camp of JeM in Balakot on February 26. Pakistan also tried to target Indian military installation the next day. Madeleine Albright, who was the US secretary of state 1997 to 2001 in the second term of the Clinton administration, said, ""I do think that we do need to figure out some way to make sure that we don't have a nuclear confrontation. ""I think the US needs to get involved in this, and I think that it is — it would be a good idea, actually, to have some kind of an envoy trying to deal with this. We can't allow this to get out of control,” Albright said responding to a question from Congressman Brad Sherman during a hearing on “Trump Administration Foreign Policy Assessment” on Wednesday. Albright said the confrontation between India and Pakistan is a test case to see whether Trump administration is equipped to manage a serious international crisis.

" Avoid 'opposition-bashing', convince world on air strikes: P Chidambaram to Centre | India News - Times of India","CHENNAI/TUTICORIN: As the debate over India's February 26 air strikes in Pakistan rages on in the country, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday asked the Centre to avoid ""opposition-bashing"" and convince the world on its stand. Chidambaram said he was prepared to ""believe the government"" as a ""proud citizen"", but the Centre has to ""make efforts for the world to also believe"" its stand. He recalled party chief Rahul Gandhi was the first to laud the Indian Air Force after the strikes. Chidambaram faced sharp rebuke from Union minister Piyush Goyal for his comments, with the senior BJP leader charging the Congress with believing in ""Pakistan propaganda,"" but not the Indian armed forces. ""As a proud citizen, I am prepared to believe my government. But if we want the world to believe, the government must make the effort (to explain), not indulge in Opposition-bashing,"" Chidambaram said in a tweet. Chidambaram's response came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi slammed the opposition for doubting the IAF air strikes in Pakistan amidst a debate in the country over the casualty inflicted by the IAF. Incidentally, on Monday, IAF Chief BS Dhanoa said the figure on casualty will be given by the government, even as Union minister SS Ahluwalia had said the purpose of the strike was not to cause human casualty but to send out the message that India is capable of hitting deep inside enemy lines. Neither Modi nor any government spokesperson had given any figure on casualty of air strikes. Rather, it was the Indian media and social media where the unconfirmed figures of terrorists killed were being circulated, he had said. Last Tuesday's air strikes were seen as retaliation to the February 14 attack on CRPF jawans in Pulwama in Kashmir, in which 40 personnel were killed. At a political rally in Patna on Sunday, Modi had said the opposition parties were speaking a language that ""suits"" Pakistan. ""Leaders of the neighbouring country are using it as a shield to protect themselves against the charge of promoting terrorism. They are clapping gleefully,"" the PM had said. On Monday, without taking any names, in another tweet, Chidambaram said, ""IAF Vice Air Marshal declined to comment on casualties."" ""The MEA statement said there were no civilian or military casualties. So, who put out the number of casualties at 300-350,"" he asked. ""Congress president Rahul Gandhi was the first to salute the Indian Air Force for its splendid achievement. Why has Mr Modi forgotten that,"" Chidambaram, former Union Minister, said. Goyal responded sharply to Chidambaram's attack, saying it was ""condemnable and shameful."" The railway minister said it was ""shameful"" that the Indian opposition was raising questions about our armed forces. ""It is an insult to the Air Force, an insult for our jawans who are willing to lay down their lives to protect the country,"" he told reporters at Tuticorin. ""..and this shows Congress party believes in Pakistan propaganda and not in our own armed forces and what our Army, Navy and Air force said."" ""It is thoroughly condemnable and I am ashamed that we have such leaders like P Chidambaram in this wonderful state of Tamil Nadu,"" Goyal said. Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala in a tweet on Monday said, ""Modi-ji, your central government ministers are stating that TV channels' news is fake, stating that the prime minister never stated that 300 terrorists were killed during the Balakot air strike. Is this true? If no, the prime minister should tell the truth. Regards, citizens of country.""

The bench said no further orders were required at this stage in view of the Centre's submissions and posted the PIL filed by lawyer Tariq Adeeb for further hearing after two weeks. The court asked the states, which have not filed their responses, to do so within a week. The SC had sought a response from the Centre as well as the states where incidents of threat and violence against Kashmiris took place after the February 14 terror attack in which over 40 CRPF personnel were killed. ""The chief secretaries, the DGPs and the Delhi Police Commissioner are directed to take prompt and necessary action to prevent all the incidents of threat, assault, social boycott and other coercive acts against Kashmiris and other minorities in the aftermath of the terrorist attack of February 14,"" the court had said. The bench had perused the advisories issued by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) to the chief secretaries and DGPs of the states from time to time and had said that they ""shall be reiterated from time to time"". The court had also directed that the police officers, who were earlier appointed as nodal officers to deal with cow vigilantism and lynching incidents, would now be responsible for dealing with the cases of assaults on Kashmiris as well. The SC had asked the home ministry to publicize the details of the nodal officers so that Kashmiri people can approach them in case of ""assault, intimidation, social boycott and threat"". Besides the Centre, top officials of Maharashtra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Delhi were directed to prevent incidents of ""threat, assault and social boycott"" of Kashmiris, including students. The plea had alleged that students from Kashmir Valley were being attacked at different educational institutions across the country after the Pulwama attack and authorities concerned should be directed to take action. Venugopal had said that the ministry had issued the requisite advisory to states and Union Territories (UTs) on this issue on February 17. Such advisories were issued earlier as well, he said. The PIL sought a direction to the Centre and other authorities for prosecuting people engaging in hate speech, and to appoint a nodal officer in every state and UT, including politically-sensitive districts, to prevent acts of violence, discrimination and vigilantism. It had also sought immediate setting up of a nationwide helpline number and a website with the contact details of the nodal officers appointed in politically-sensitive districts. ""There is a sudden rise in the incidents of crimes against Muslims and Kashmiris after the Pulwama terrorist attack on February 14 in which over 40 soldiers were killed,"" the petition said. ""Immediately after the attack, mobs and vigilante groups engaged in vitriolic hate speech and began attacking, and threatening Muslims and Kashmiris throughout the country,"" it added. ""These incidents are a part of organised hate campaign against Muslims and Kashmiris, most cases which are fabricated and the hysteria that now surrounds India has been engineered to gain political mileage,"" it said further. ""The extremist groups have led vigilante mob attacks across the country to enforce nationalism by leaders of various groups who claim to promote and instigated hate crimes,"" it added.

Balakot surgical strike: Pakistani parliamentarians demand befitting response to 'aggressor' India | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Pakistani lawmakers have expressed unhappiness over Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj being invited by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a ‘guest of honour’ at the 26th Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) States meet which is set to take place in Abu Dhabi on March 1 and 2. The attack by the Indian Air Force at the terror camps in Balakot early on Tuesday has added to the pain of the Pakistani lawmakers. The Pakistani parliamentarians have asked the Imran Khan government whether they were consulted before Sushma Swaraj was invited to the meet. Some speakers suggested that Pakistan should boycott the session. The invitation to Sushma Swaraj is being considered a huge diplomatic victory for India and, conversely, a massive setback for Pakistan because this is the first such invite in five decades. The Pakistani government is at the receiving end of the wrath of its lawmakers following the strike by Indian Air Force (IAF) at the terror camps. One speaker after the other expressed anguish over the attack by 12 Indian Mirage 2000 jets. On air strike by the IAF, the Pakistani lawmakers have asked their government to convene a joint session of their Parliament and demanded a befitting response to India. ""Pakistan's sovereign status has been challenged by India,"" was the general refrain in Parliament. Some criticised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him ""narrow minded"". They demanded a joint session of their Parliament to give a befitting response to the ""aggressor India"". A speaker in the Pakistani Parliament remarked it was a shame when terrorist Osama bin Laden was killed by intruding forces in Abbottabad. ""We could do nothing to the aggressor due to our limitations. But we have no limitation this time. We must act against India,"" the speaker demanded.

" IAF air strike in Pakistan: Mirages took off from Gwalior, not forward base, to retain surprise | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Fighter jets, mid-air refuellers and early-warning aircraft from at least five airbases closely coordinated to unleash the ""strike package"" on the Balakot terror facility. The aim was to blow six targets within the facility to smithereens in two waves of firing. ""The six were first hit with one wave of weapons. The second wave was executed once the dust settled after the first hit. The battle damage assessment was 100%,"" a top defence source said here. On February 16, TOI had reported that precision airstrikes were the government's favoured option for retaliatory action following the Pulwama terror attack. Four Sukhoi-30MKI ""air dominance"" fighters from the Bareilly and Halwara airbases were tasked with ""an air defence role"" for the mission, with an additional number on hot stand-by. ""Pakistan scrambled some fighters but they went back after seeing the large IAF formation...they never came close,"" said the source.

""ISI informants are active around forward IAF bases on the western front and promptly report unusual fighter activity,"" said a source. The Mirage-2000s, which underwent mid-air refuelling by ILyushin-78s based in Agra, also took a circuitous route to the Muzaffarabad sector along the LOC by avoiding congested airspaces like the one over New Delhi. IAF also deployed a Phalcon AWACS from Agra and an indigenous mini-AWACS from Bathinda to vector the fighters towards the target as well as track Pakistani jets.

" After Imran’s threat, Modi recalls surgical strikes | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned from his US trip to an enthusiastic welcome organised by BJP, recalled the surgical strike India carried out inside Pakistan-controlled territory exactly three years ago to avenge the ISI-engineered terror attack on an Army camp in Uri. “Today is September 28 and it was exactly three years ago when I could not sleep for whole night. I stayed awake entire night waiting for the phone to ring. Three years ago it was on this day, our brave soldiers wrote a golden chapter of their bravery. After successful surgical strikes, they demonstrated power of India. Recalling that night, I salute the great soldiers of our country,” he said. His remarks came a day after Pakistan PM Imran Khan, in a bellicose speech at the UNGA, fulminated against the Modi government’s decision to end special status for J&K, and held out dire warnings of “bloodbath” in the state, terror attacks and communal strife across India and a nuclear conflagration. The “ surgical strike” marked the advent of a tougher posture towards the hostile neighbour, marking the end of “strategic restraint” where the fear of use of nuclear arms by Pakistan forced India to circumscribe its response to terror attacks planned across the border. The Modi government followed the 2016 raid on terror camps across the LoC by sending IAF fighter jets to attack Jaish-e-Mohammad’s terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot in February this year. In his speech, Modi said BJP’s return to power with a bigger mandate has enhanced India’s stature resulting in greater acceptance for India’s position. “This all because of you,” Modi told cheering crowds who had gathered at the airport to fete the PM for the “diplomatic win over Pakistan” at the UN. The crowds and lusty cheers were ample indication that the end of special status of J&K and tough line towards Pakistan will be big themes of BJP’s campaign in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections. Welcoming Modi, BJP chief and home minister Amit Shah said, “I join millions of Indians in welcoming PM Narendra Modi after a historic US visit, which has given India a new aura on the world stage. His leadership is a beacon of hope.” While Shah was not in Delhi, BJP working president J P Nadda led the party leaders to receive Modi at the airport. Lok Sabha MPs from Delhi were also present. The PM said the world’s view towards India has changed immensely in the past five years as the country’s acceptance and respect has gone high, which he attributed to the grand mandate his party received in the recent Lok Sabha polls. “After winning polls, I had gone to the United Nations and America in 2014 and went again in 2019. I could sense the difference as respect for India in the entire world has increased. One principal reason behind this change of the world view towards India are the 130 crore Indians, who chose the government with more emphatic mandate,” he said. The PM said the presence of US President Donald Trump at the “Howdy Modi” event and the way the entire event was perceived globally demonstrated an unprecedented show of strength. “There were Democrats, Republicans at the Howdy Modi event. But when I met the world leaders at the UN, most of them greeted me with ‘Howdy Modi’, which reflected that India’s power has increased globally,” he said.

He claimed that National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) system had informed about presence of around 300 active mobile phones at the site before the air strike by India. Charging the opposition of doing politics over the strike, the home minister suggested the Congress to go to Pakistan and count the bodies if they want to know how many terrorists were killed. ""Some leaders of the other political parties are asking how many terrorists were killed in the IAF strike. Today or tomorrow, it will be known.

" 15 years on, DRDO’s supersonic missile ready for IAF fighters | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: India’s first indigenous beyond visual range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) for fighters, Astra, is now finally ready for induction after 15 tortuous years of development, with the DRDO expecting the IAF to initially order at least 200 missiles for its Sukhoi-30MKI jets. The Defence Research and Development Organisation is also already working to increase Astra’s strike range from the existing 110-km to over 160-km. “Astra is one of the best BVRAAMs in the world today. We have the capability to develop it for longer ranges,” said DRDO chief Dr G Satheesh Reddy, talking to TOI. India has joined a handful of countries like US, Russia, France and Israel in developing such advanced air combat missiles that can destroy highly-agile enemy supersonic fighters packed with “counter-measures’’ at long ranges, say officials. The importance of having deadly air-to-air missiles was underscored during the skirmish between Indian and Pakistani fighters along the Line of Control on February 27, a day after IAF jets bombed the JeM facility at Balakot. Could have inflicted heavy damage on Pak during Feb 27 dogfight if possessed 'tech asymmetry': IAFThe sleek 3.57-metre long Astra, with a mass weight of 154-kg, flies over four times the speed of sound at Mach 4.5. To be produced by defence PSU Bharat Dynamics for about Rs 7-8 crore per unit, Astra will be a much cheaper indigenous alternative to some of the expensive Russian, French and Israeli BVRAAMs currently imported to arm IAF fighters. After the Russian-origin Sukhois, the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft will also be equipped with the all-weather Astra. The missile, which is capable of handling multi-target scenarios, has “state-of-the-art ECCM (electronic counter-counter measures) to tackle jamming by hostile aircraft, active radar terminal guidance and “highly accurate complex end-game algorithms for high single-shot kill probability” in both head-on and tail-chase modes. The DRDO is all gung-ho after it conducted five   successful trials of the Astra from Sukhoi fighters   against Jet Banshee target aircraft or UAVs, simulating all possible threat scenarios, off the Chandipur coast in Odisha last week. “The targets were hit at distances of 80 to 86-km with pinpoint accuracy. The technologies developed under the programme will be the building blocks for developing future variants of air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles,” said an official. India may have developed long-range nuclear missiles like the Agni-V, which has a strike range over 5,000-km, but had faltered in building BVRAAMs till now. Astra suffered from several technical glitches like a defective aerodynamic configuration since the missile project was first sanctioned in March 2004 at an initial cost of Rs 955 crore.

In an interview to PTI, Vardhan, who is BJP's Chandni Chowk candidate, asserted that his campaign is centred around development issues and not the air strike as people were already hailing the valour of the defence forces. ""For us all, these issues which are related to the nationalistic sentiment of this country, to the valour of the army men, to the holistic and comprehensive nationalistic vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are not political issues and not the ones about which you think in terms of votes."" ""I don't raise this issue (Balakot air strike) on my own. I have hundreds of other issues related to development done by me in my constituency and other issues where we have brought science and technology to higher pedestal internationally,"" Vardhan said when asked about whether he too will use the issue in his election campaign, like the Prime Minister did. Recently, at a poll rally in Patan, Gujarat, PM Modi told people that he had warned Pakistan of consequences if it had not returned Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman. The Prime Minister has been referring to national security and the recent strikes by India against terrorists in his poll campaigns across the country. Sixty-four-year-old Vardhan, who is the minister of science and technology, earth sciences and environment, forests and climate change, said he himself does not talk about the air strike and national security in campaigns but ""there is nothing abnormal even if it is raised"". Hailing the BJP-led Central government and the Prime Minister, Vardhan said that the government has shown the world that India cannot be taken for granted. ""There are thousands of other things to talk about. When I talk to people, I don't talk about Balakot. However, there is nothing abnormal if I raise it on my own. The government has shown not only to Pakistan but to the whole world that we really mean business, you cannot take us for granted. For us, it is not a political issue and it will never be. Even if you ask the most illiterate person in the country, he will praise the army men and the leadership of the PM,"" he said. Vardhan, incumbent MP from Chandi Chowk and a four-time MLA from east Delhi's Krishna Nagar, refuted the allegations of the opposition that BJP was ""blatantly politicising"" Balakot air strike and seeking votes in the name of martyrs, saying it showed the ""sheer frustration"" of opposition parties. ""This is just out of sheer frustration that they (opposition) are talking about all these illogical, irrelevant things. Any issue related to valour will be engrained in history. Balakot incident was done in such a meticulous manner, that it will be recorded as one of the most sophisticated air strikes carried out by any country that went to another country and destroyed terror camps. It's an achievement worth recognising internationally as well as nationally,"" he said. He said issues cannot be manufactured in a cabinet meeting or at a political party's office but are those which are discussed by the people. ""Issue is something which you cannot manufacture in a cabinet meeting or in a political party's office. Issues are those about which people of India think. I have strongly observed that today we don't have to talk about the valour of the PM before people. It is the people who talk about Balakot, Uri and these air strikes and accomplishments in space,"" he said. The Indian Air Force had struck Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist training camps in Pakistan on February 26 in response to the February 14 Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.

 Arvind Kejriwal lambasts Yeddyurappa for remarks on air strike in Balakot | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday slammed Karnataka BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa for his remark that India's preemptive air strike on a terror camp in Pakistan has created a wave in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kejriwal also raised question whether the tension between the two countries was orchestrated by the BJP for reaping political benefits. ""Former BJP CM Yeddyurappa's statement has come that 40 Jawans have been martyred now we will win 22 seats. I want to ask them how many Jawans you want martyred for 300 seats, how many women widowed, how many corpses you want how many families will you destroy.

"Narendra Modi: Pakistan braced for land strikes, we surprised it with air raid | India News - Times of India","GREATER NOIDA: Keeping the focus of his election season messaging firmly on Indian air strikes in Balakot, PM Narendra Modi on Saturday spoke of how his government had outwitted Pakistan, claiming it was bracing for a land retaliation from India after the terrorist attack on CRPF jawans in Pulwama on February 14. “They were thinking that Modi carried out surgical strikes last time (in 2016, after the Uri attack) and the same would happen the second time. And then, at the LoC, they (Pakistan) had all kinds of things, tanks and what not lining up. And what did we do?” he asked his audience on the campus of Pt Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology in Greater Noida’s Knowledge Park, referring to the air strikes on the Jaish camp at Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. TOI had reported the day after the Pulwama attack that an air strike was the government’s most favoured option. Stating that   "" terrorist got an answer in their own language""   , Modi said Pakistan had become “so scared that around 5 am, they told the world that Indian forces had hit them”. “They started saying Modi has hit (us). The world was informed by them, not us,” the PM said. UPA had failed to respond to 26/11 terror attacks: PMDuring a rally in Hindon in Ghaziabad on Friday, PM Modi had said he hadn’t taken credit for the air strikes (a response to the opposition which has accused him and BJP of “politicising” the military operation for electoral gains). Modi, who inaugurated the archaeology campus, was visiting NCR for the second time in two days. On Friday, he had inaugurated the civil terminal of Hindon airbase and Red Line Extension in Ghaziabad. He also flagged off the Blue Line Extension in Noida on Saturday. Jewar airport in Noida to be India's biggest: PM ModiLike in Friday’s rally, he once again lashed out at the UPA government for failing to respond to the 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The PM said there were reports that the Army, IAF and Navy were ready to answer but were held back. “Their blood was boiling but Delhi was lying on a cold bed. Our forces were not given permission. Their hands and legs were tied. Can we counter terror by tying them up? Can this work?” he said, adding the country today follows “nayi reeti, nayi neeti” (new methods, new policies). “They were thinking they can keep wounding India, wage attacks, proxy wars and India would not respond. The reason the enemies of India could think this was because of the attitude of the ‘remote-controlled’ government prior to 2014. That is why the enemies could nurture this attitude,” he said, an oblique reference to the way the UPA regime functioned under PM Manmohan Singh with Sonia Gandhi as the alliance chairperson. The PM, who also inaugurated two power projects, likened Congress to the old machines being used at power plants in Kanpur. “Aj har bhrasht ko Modi se kasht hai (Today, every corrupt is upset with Modi),” he said.

 Confusion created by IAF officer in ATC being blamed for Mi-17 chopper crash over Srinagar | India News - Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Confusion created by an IAF officer in the Air Traffic Control (ATC) could have been the main reason behind the accident in which six Air Force personnel were killed, reveals a probe into the February 27 Mi-17 chopper crash that took place in the aftermath of the Balakot air strikes. It is emerging that one of the officers in the ATC tower first cleared the ill-fated Mi-17 chopper to return to the base but on the other hand also communicated to the air defence unit that there was no aircraft due to land at the air base, sources in the Air Force told ANI. ""During the probe, it is emerging that the officer first called the Mi-17 back to the Srinagar air base when it was going for a mission and then when the air defence officers sought to know if any own aircraft was coming towards the air base, they were told that no chopper or aircraft was inbound at the base,"" they said. The Court of Inquiry into the accident was completed once but had to be reopened as the officers facing the trial wanted to question more witnesses, the sources said. Apart from the officer in the ATC, one officer in the air defence of the air base is likely to be court-martialed for the crash of its Mi-17V5 chopper near Srinagar on February 27. The chopper crashed near Budgam on the morning of February 27 when Pakistan launched a counter-attack in response to the Balakot air strikes. The Mi-17 chopper crashed with six occupants on board and reports had emerged that the chopper was hit by its own air defence system SPYDER which is deployed in Srinagar. However, the overall information will only be disclosed once the investigation is complete. Top Defence Ministry and Air Force officials are of the view that severe punishment should be given to personnel found guilty for the accident. The Mi-17 V-5 chopper belonged to the 154 Helicopter Unit and it crashed within 10 minutes after taking off while the Indian fighter jets were involved in an aerial dogfight with Pakistani jets. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was also a part of this dogfight. One civilian on the ground also lost his life along with the six IAF personnel on board. The court of inquiry was delayed as the black box of the chopper was reportedly stolen by the villagers in Budgam and some locals had also reportedly pelted stones at military vehicles after they approached the crash site. Air Marshal Hari Kumar was the Air Officer Commanding in Chief of the Western Air Command when the Balakot air strikes happened in Pakistan. He retired on February 28- a day after the Mi-17 chopper had crashed. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

 Congress leader quits over party's demand for air strike proof | India News - Times of India,"PATNA: In what could be seen as a jolt to Bihar Congress ahead of the parliamentary election, senior leader and spokesman Binod Sharma resigned on Saturday, contending that the party should not have demanded evidence of Balakot air strike. In a letter addressed to Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Sharma said the party high command has hurt the sentiments of ground-level workers and the common people by raising questions over the ""pre-emptive"" strike on the terror camps in Balakot, days after the Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy. The senior leader also said that he wrote to Gandhi several times in the last one month, apprising him of the sensibilities of the party workers in the state, but his requests were not entertained. Terming the repeated demands for proof of air strike as ""shameful and childish"", he said, ""I am resigning from the Congress with a heavy heart after serving it for 30 years. The party high command has hurt sentiments by breaking the Army's morale while boosting the spirits of terrorists."" Sharma alleged that some Congress leaders have ""strayed from the path shown by party's stalwarts Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi"". ""Today, we (Congress members) are seen as Pakistani agents. I feel ashamed of being called a Congressman. Since the nation is above party, I am resigning from Congress,"" he stated in his letter. The senior leader also said that many party workers, who are disappointed with the high command's stance over the air strike, may follow in his footsteps. Without taking names, Sharma said he would join a party that puts the nation ahead of ""petty politics"". A former general secretary of Bihar Congress, Sharma had unsuccessfully fought the Paliganj assembly by-poll on a Congress ticket in 1996. He also served as the president of National Students Union of India's Bihar unit from 1996 to 2000. On February 14, a convoy of vehicles carrying CRPF personnel was attacked by a suicide bomber in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, resulting in the death of 40 jawans.

 Pakistan turns down India's request to open its airspace for PM's flight to US | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan has turned down an overflight request by India for Prime Minister Modi's upcoming US trip. This request, according to officials, is as per protocol since Air India One is not a scheduled commercial flight but a VVIP charter. The longer route that AI One will now take increases the flying time for the Delhi-Frankfurt leg of the journey by 45-50 minutes. Frankfurt is the fuelling and crew change stop for AI Boeing 747’s onward flight to Houston where “Howdy Modi” will be organised this Sunday with US President Donald Trump joining in at the mega event. Earlier this month, Pakistan had turned down a similar request   for President Ram Nath Kovind's flight   to Europe. Ministry of external affairs official spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said: “We regret the decision of the government of Pakistan to deny overflight clearance for the VVIP special flight for a second time in two weeks, which is otherwise granted routinely by any normal country. Pakistan should reflect upon its decision to deviate from well established international practice, as well as reconsider its old habit of misrepresenting the reasons for taking unilateral action.” The alternate route from Delhi bypassing Pakistan airspace means flying near Mumbai-Arabian Sea (steering clear of Pakistan airspace around Karachi) — Muscat — and then to Europe. The straight route would have entailed flying from Delhi to Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran to Europe. Pakistan had closed its airspace for overflying on February 27 following Indian Air Force’s Balakot strike and had re-opened the same after 138 days on July 16. During this time all flights between Delhi and the west took the longer route. In June   Prime Minister Modi flew from Delhi to Bishkek   . Due to the longer route, AI One covered a distance of 5,475 km with a block time (time from when aircraft door closes for departure to when it opens at destination on landing) of 6 hours and 30 minutes. The straight route over Pakistan would have meant covering a distance 2,585 km in a block time of 3 hours and 45 minutes. Taking the longer route from Delhi to Gujarat-Arabian Sea-Oman-Iran-Central Asia-Bishkek meant covering 2,890 km extra and increased flying time of two hours and 45 minutes. Indian presidents, VPs and PMs will be able to fly nonstop to North America by early next year when two new state-of-the-art Boeing 777s joins as dedicated AI or IAF One. The jumbo jets currently used for long haul flights as AI One are over 25 year old and can fly to US with a stop in Europe. The B777s, on the other hand, have been doing India-US non-stop for AI on scheduled commercial flights for over a decade now. Even bypassing Pakistan airspace between Delhi and east coast of North America will not require a fuelling stop in Europe for the next-gen AI/IAF One.

 Those seeking proof of air strike 'appeasing' Pakistan: PM Modi | India News - Times of India,"GHAZIABAD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday accused the opposition of ""appeasing"" Pakistan by seeking proof of the Balakot air strike. ""Will you (people) do anything that appeases Pakistan or makes Pakistan clap? But some of our opposition leaders have been doing the same for the past 10 days. Identify these people, they are not worried about the country, but scared of going behind the bars and that is why they want to capture power at the Centre,"" Modi said at a public meeting here. Pointing about a tweet by a Pakistan army spokesperson about the air strike, Modi said: ""Is Pakistan stupid to do this (tweet)? The 130 crore people of India are my proof. Please stop appeasing Pakistan."" The opposition has been demanding that the Centre come out with the details, including the number of terrorists killed, of the air strike by the Indian Air Force in Pakistan's Balakot last week. The Prime Minister said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government did not seek any credit for the air strike. ""Now after the recent air strikes, you may have noticed the Indian government was quiet about it. And we did not sleep after the air strike. This 'chowkidaar' (watchman) was awake. We showed such bravery, but still kept quiet and did not seek any credit. It was Pakistan which first tweeted about it and started crying from 5 am. It was Pakstan which first spoke about India's courageous action,"" he told the crowd after inaugurating a slew of development projects. Modi accused the Congress, Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party among others of not being ready to trust the armed forces. ""They are the same people, who raised questions and disrespected the armed forces after the (2016) surgical strike. And, gradually when all the facts emerged, they turned speechless."" The Prime Minister alleged that the previous government had done nothing after the 2008 Mumbai attack and if the people wanted a similar response to such incidents, they would not have elected him. ""When terrorists killed our 40 soldiers in Pulwama, should Modi also have kept quiet? If I had to behave the way previous governments did, why did the people elect me?"" he asked. Forty Central Reserve Police Force personnel were killed when a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a bus in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district. ""Is it acceptable to you the way they (previous government) did? Should not I work according to the will of the people? Doesn't every Indian want to teach Pakistan a lesson?

The Patna Sahib MP also said that he had great respect for veteran Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who has drawn flak for calling the Pulwama terror attack a durghatna (accident), and said the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister wanted to say something but could not choose his words wisely. I am of the firm opinion that all central ministers/responsible persons should speak in one voice on air strikes and avoid confusing statements. This is the least we can do to honour our brave armed forces, wrote the actor-turned-politician on his official twitter handle. However, he also shared the link of a local news portal with which he had a detailed conversation on the issue. livebudget updatesmoreupdatesHe was quoted therein as having said our Radha Mohan Singh and Yogi Adityanath are saying 400 terrorists were killed. On different channels, Raag Darbaris (court jesters) of the government are saying 300 have been killed.. somebody else says 500 have been killed. What is this tamasha? Under these circumstances, not only the opposition but even the common people want to know how many militants were actually killed.. if the Centre comes on record on the issue, I think it would only boost the morale of the public and also bring laurels to the government, he was quoted as saying. Asked about the faux pas by Digvijay Singh, Sinha said I have great respect for him. He is a very mature leader. I do not want to get drawn into a debate over semantics. He wanted to say something but, apparently, could not choose his words wisely.

 Technology on India's side in Balakot operation: IAF chief | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Technology was on India's side in the Balakot air strikes, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Monday, asserting that the results would have been further tilted in the country's favour if Rafale jets were inducted in time. The Indian Air Force chief was addressing a gathering at a seminar on aerospace power of the future and the impact of technology. ""In the Balakot operation, we had technology on our side, and we could launch precision stand of weapons with great accuracy. In the subsequent engagements, we came out better because we upgraded our MiG-21s, Bisons, and Mirage-2000 aircraft,"" he said. ""The results would have been further skewed in our favour had we inducted the Rafale aircraft in time,"" Dhanoa said. The Air Force struck a Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot area on February 26, in response to the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. The Pakistan Air Force retaliated the next day by unsuccessfully targeting various military installations in Jammu and Kashmir. Dhanoa said in his speech, ""In the proposed induction of the Rafale and S-400 surface-to-air missile system, in the next two-four years, once again the technological balance will shift in our favour, like it was in 2002 during Operation Parakaram during the last stand-off."" India inked an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore. The delivery of the jets -- capable of carrying a range of potent weapons and missiles -- is scheduled to begin from September. In October last year, India and Russia signed a multibillion dollar deal for S-400 'Triumf' long-range air defence missile systems. It has the capability to destroy incoming hostile aircraft, missiles and even drones at ranges of up to 400 km. The seminar on 'Aerospace power in the 2040s: Impact of Technology' was held at Subroto Park here to mark the birth centenary of the late Marshal of the IAF Arjan Singh. The event was hosted by the IAF along with the Centre for Air Power Studies (CAPS), an autonomous defence research and analysis body. ""Among all arms of the military, technology affects us the most ... land forces mainly fight with men, naval and air force officers operate machines and in the Air Force this technology has to be packed in smaller machines and subject to extreme temperature and pressure conditions,"" the IAF chief said. And, air power is more sensitive to technological change, he said. Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week complimented the IAF for its ""flawless execution"" of the February 26 Balakot operation and subsequent thwarting of the Pakistani response while addressing top IAF commanders here. At the event on April 11, Dhanoa emphasised on further enhancing the IAF's capability in the field of space, cyber, artificial intelligence and drone technology to further boost its overall combat capability. Various IAF veterans, at the seminar paid tribute to Singh, who led the Indian Air Force during the 1965 India-Pakistan war, died in September 2017 at the age of 98. An icon in the country's military history, Singh led a fledgling IAF in the 1965 India-Pakistan war when he was just 44 years old. Born on April 15, 1919, in Lyallpur in Punjab in undivided India, his father, grandfather and great grandfather had served in the cavalry. ""This event is a fitting tribute to IAF Marshal Arjan Singh,"" Dhanoa said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"Air India posts Rs 4,600 crore operating loss in 2018-19; aims operating profit this fiscal - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Air India posted an operating loss of around Rs 4,600 crore in the last financial year mainly due to higher oil prices and foreign exchange losses but the debt-laden carrier expects to turn operationally profitable in 2019-20, according to senior officials. Reflecting tough business conditions, the airline's net loss stood at about Rs 8,400 crore while total revenues touched around Rs 26,400 crore in 2018-19, one of the senior officials told PTI. Another senior official said the airline is projected to post an operating profit of Rs 700 to 800 crore in 2019-20, provided oil prices do not shoot up significantly and there is no steep fluctuation in foreign exchange rates. However, the airline incurred an operating loss of Rs 175 to 200 crore in the three months ended June as closure of Pakistan airspace for Indian carriers resulted in higher costs and caused a daily loss of Rs 3 to 4 crore when the restrictions were in place, the official said. Air India had a loss of Rs 430 crore in the four-month period when Pakistan closed its airspace after the Balakot air strikes. The official noted that load factor and yields are improving for Air India, which currently flies to 41 international and 72 domestic destinations. Load factor is a measure of seat occupancy and yield refers to average fare paid per passenger. The situation is anticipated to improve further as more wide-body planes would be available for operations in the coming months, the official added. Air India had grounded several of its wide-body aircraft for maintenance and most of them are in the process of being re-inducted into the fleet. Air India is to start flying to Toronto from September 27 and to Nairobi in November. The airline has a debt burden of more than Rs 58,000 crore and servicing the loans is a major challenge as the annual outgo is more than Rs 4,000 crore. The official who was quoted first said the carrier is facing a financial crisis and disinvestment is the option. Aviation consultancy CAPA South Asia CEO and Director Kapil Kaul said Air India's financial position is likely to ""significantly improve"" in the current financial year. ""CAPA expects a closer to break-even in FY 20 excluding increased costs incurred due to closure of Pakistan airspace. With oil prices expected to stay below USD 60, expect a closer to break-even for Air India in FY 20,” he told PTI. Noting that improved financial performance would be a positive for divestment, Kaul said a fully divested Air India that is well capitalised and with improved governance and management would ensure that the airline has a relevant future. India needs a stronger Air India which is viable without taxpayers' support, he added. The government has decided on disinvestment of Air India as part of efforts to revive its fortunes. Air India, which has been in the red for long, was sanctioned a nearly Rs 30,000 crore bailout package for a 10-year period by the UPA regime in 2012.

" Air strike was good response, but diplomacy is way forward: Experts | India News - Times of India","BENGALURU: Former diplomat Latha Reddy, while applauding both the armed forces and the diplomats for their efforts, said that bravado, jingoism and domestic compulsions should not dictate how India acts against Pakistan. Instead, a patient diplomatic route should be seen as the best option. “We are proud of our armed forces and confident that they will do everything that is needed to be done for the country when pressed into action. But let’s not rush in to attack due to domestic compulsions. ...Bravado and jingoism should not dictate action as Pakistan has not changed fundamentally from what happened in Balakot or thereafter and it has not learnt any lesson,” Reddy said. Conceding that diplomacy is a slow tool, she still, however, advocated it to be the best option to deal with Pakistan given the neighbouring country’s geopolitical advantage that makes it very difficult for the West or the Gulf to completely isolate it. “Talking about what happened since Pulwama (the attack by JeM on February 14), I must say that in diplomatic terms it has been a success: Not a single country has censured India and neither has any country openly supported Pakistan. Our diplomats around the world have done well to prevent negative stand against India,” Reddy said. She, however, reiterated that such achievements do not happen overnight, and that the fruits of diplomacy are often results of very long relationships, friendships and other variables. “In the 1960s nobody supported us, In 1971 we had the USSR but in a limited way but today we have so much support from France, UK, US, Russia, the Arab world and so on, and these are all results of continuing efforts from the late 1990s. Also, the Indian economy and its growth has played a major role in garnering such support,” she said. Arguing that India should not get swayed away by domestic considerations, she said: “...Even during Kandahar we returned the terrorists because of media frenzy and domestic compulsions.” Lt Gen (retd) Prakash Menon, while stating that the Indian government had no choice but to respond to Pulwama, said it was, however, also important to note how our strike was projected thereafter. “If we think that with this we have managed to deter Pakistan from using terror as a front to further its foreign policy, then we are not completely right. The air strike and the message from it has only limited use. They will carry on,” Menon said. He said that while India wants to send a message that it today possess a greater political will that would use its armed forces in response to Pulwama-type attacks, we must understand that Pakistan may not be getting the same message. “Internationally India wants to enhance Pakistan’s isolation, but will we continue to get the same kind of global support if we continue to be more aggressive? It is a question worth asking given that Pakistan, despite the whole world agreeing that it is a state that harbours terrorism is also the most coveted thanks to the geopolitics,” Menon said. Prof Suba Chandran, dean, School of Conflict and Security Studies at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (Nias), argued how Pakistan’s behaviour post Pulwama, especially the way the country reacted after India’s strike has more to do with its problems on other sides of the border and global compulsions than what is being projected. Reddy and other experts spoke at a discussion on Pulwama, Balakot and the scenario thereafter organised at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.

 Balakot airstrike was a major achievement: Northern Army commander | India News - Times of India,"UDHAMPUR: Northern Army commander Lt Gen Ranbir Singh Monday termed the IAF's Balakot airstrike on a terrorist camp in Pakistan as a ""major achievement"". He also confirmed that the first surgical strike was carried out by India in September 2016 while quoting an RTI reply by Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) and the Indian Army. ""The action by the Indian Air Force on the February 26 for carrying out air strikes on Balakot terrorist infrastructure was indeed laudable,"" Lt Gen Singh told reporters here. ""It was a major achievement wherein our aircrafts went deep into enemy territory and struck terror launchpads and camps,"" he added. Lt Gen Singh said the Pakistanis carried out their air operations very close to the Line of Control the following day but were given a ""befitting reply"". ""I wish to assure you, the Indian armed forces have the capability, the resolve and operational plans absolutely geared up to take on any challenge from Pakistan whenever it arises,"" he added. Asked if India conducted any surgical strike before September 2016, Lt Gen Singh replied in the negative. Citing an RTI reply by Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Indian Army, Singh said, ""A few days ago DGMO said in a reply to an RTI that the first surgical strike happened in Sep 2016, I don't want to go into what political parties say as they'll be given an answer by government. What I told you is a statement of fact."" Some Congress leaders including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh claimed that several surgical strikes were conducted by army during the previous UPA rule. ""Multiple surgical strikes took place during our tenure, too. For us, military operations were meant for strategic deterrence and giving a befitting reply to anti-India forces than to be used for vote garnering exercises,"" Singh had said in an interview to a newspaper. Congress leader Rajiv Shukla had told reporters at a briefing last week that six surgical strikes were conducted during the tenure of the Manmohan Singh government. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had questioned the claims and said that the Congress had a habit of lying. Union minister VK Singh, a former army chief, on Saturday denied knowledge of a surgical strike during his tenure and accused the Congress of lying about it. In a tweet, he said, ""Congress has a habit of lying. Will you please let me know which 'So-called Surgical Strike' are you attributing to my tenure as COAS (chief of army staff).

 Sharad Pawar refuses to buy Amit Shah's claim of casualty in air strike | India News - Times of India,"MUMBAI: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Monday expressed surprise over BJP chief Amit Shah's claim of more than 250 terrorists being killed in the Balakot air strike and said if the casualty figure had come from defence personnel, he would have taken it seriously. Pawar also said no political benefit should be sought from the February 26 air attack on a JeM training camp at Balakot in Pakistan. He was speaking to reporters after meeting the family of Indian air force pilot Ninad Mandavgane, who died in a helicopter accident in Srinagar recently, in Nashik, around 200km from here in north Maharashtra. Shah, addressing a rally in Gujarat, had claimed the IAF air strike on the terror camp had killed ""more than 250"" terrorists. The government is yet to officially come out with the number of terrorists killed in the operation. ""Had the claim of casualty in the air strike come from any defence person, I would have taken it seriously. In such a situation, no political benefit or gain should be sought. ""I am surprised that Amit Shah makes such a statement on this issue,"" Pawar said. ""His is an inappropriate statement over the issue,"" said the former defence minister. ""No one can help if someone wants to seek benefit out of it. This would create a different kind of picture about the society. This is not good,"" Pawar said.

 ‘Sharp rise in infiltration bids in J&amp;K since August 5’ | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: There has been a sharp rise in infiltration of terrorists into J&K since the nullification of Article 370, which is seen by intelligence agencies as a clear sign of Pakistan-based terror groups trying to create disturbances in the Valley with terror strikes. Sources in the central security establishment told TOI that as many as 40-50 terrorists have sneaked into Kashmir Valley since August 5 when Centre’s decisions on J&K status were announced, as compared to just six infiltration cases in July. The spike in cross-border infiltration comes amid intelligence inputs that Pak-based outfits like Lashker-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammed have activated terror launchpads near the LoC, with over 200 terrorists waiting to cross over. These launchpads are said to have been temporarily abandoned following the air strikes by Indian Air Force on Jaish facilities in Balakot in Pakistan in February this year. A senior para-military officer said the pushing in of a large number of terrorists by LeT and Jaish indicates their attempts, under instructions of ISI, to stir trouble in the Kashmir Valley with some big terror attacks. With average life of a local terror recruit in Kashmir having been drastically reduced to anything between a month and six months, thanks to sustained intelligence-based operations by the security forces, there is now a conscious move to rely more on hardened foreign fighters to carry out lethal and fidayeen strikes. Terrorists have not been able to carry out any big attack since Article 370 became a dead letter. Even engagement of forces with terrorists have been fewer. While this can be attributed to preoccupation of the forces in the initial month after abrogation, with managing law and order, some officers admitted that the communication shutdown in the Valley has dried up technical intelligence about local hideouts, movements and plans of the terrorists based in the Valley. “The spike in infiltration and the fact that terrorists are lying low means that they may be planning something big,” said an officer. As per figures accessed by TOI, a total 11 cross-border infiltration attempts into J&K were recorded in July. Of the 11 infiltration attempts in July, 5 were repulsed by the border guarding forces even as six terrorists managed to cross over. However the month of August has seen 40-50 successful infiltrations, which translates into a 7-8 times increase over July. Infiltration this year has been low, especially in wake of the IAF air strikes on Jaish facilities deep inside Pakistani territory. According to a written reply in Parliament, minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy said the net infiltration in the first six months of this year was 43% lower than the corresponding period of 2018.

 Digvijaya Singh seeks proof of air strikes to ‘maintain honour of soldiers’ | India News - Times of India,"INDORE: Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh on Saturday asked the Centre to produce evidence of success of India’s air strike on Jaish terror camps in Balakot to “maintain the honor of the Army and IAF”, and thanked Pakistan PM Imran Khan for releasing wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman. “He (Imran) sent wing commander Abhinandan Varthman back without bargaining, for which I congratulate him. He has shown a new path by being a good neighbour. I am very happy that he sent back our pilot despite facing criticism from ISI and his own party members that he should have bargained with India,” the former CM, said adding: “The Pakistan PM must now show bravery and hand over Hafiz Sayeed and Masood Azhar to India.” Singh called PM Narendra Modi a “liar”, and asked him to produce proof of success of the air strike in Balakot. “To silence the questions raised over the success of air strikes, the government should do everything necessary for maintaining the dignity and honour of the Army and Air Force,” Singh told reporters here. Not being able to prevent the attack on CRPF jawans is a failure of the government, the Congress veteran said, suggesting that the jawans should have been flown to their postings instead of being sent by road. “How was a vehicle filled with explosives allowed to enter the path used by jawans?” he wondered. Criticising the PM’s handling of the aftermath of the terror attack, Singh said: “The Prime Minister was at Corbett (National Park) when the incident took place. National mourning should have been immediately declared and a meeting of security council should have been called in Delhi. It was called only the next day,” Singh pointed out. He urged the Pakistan government to take action against Masood Azhar and Hafiz Sayeed. “Major countries must exert international pressure on Pakistan to give up these two terrorists,” he said. Criticizing the politicization of the Pulwama terror attack and IAF counter-strike, Singh said: “In 1971 and 2001, when similar sensitive conditions prevailed, Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee had refrained from politicizing the matter and the same should be done now,” he said. On the Lok Sabha elections, Singh said that just as Vajpayee was defeated in 2004, Narendra Modi will be defeated by Congress in 2019. Asked about Indore MP Sumitra Mahajan’s reported reluctance to “hand over keys of Indore” to someone else, Digvijaya Singh said, “It might be Tai’s opinion because Kailash Vijayvargiya also does not hold any big position from her point of view.” Vijayvargiya, who had refused to contest assembly polls from Mhow, is believed to be eyeing the BJP Lok Sabha ticket from Indore.

" Intention of air strike was to send out a message, not kill: Union minister | India News - Times of India","KOLKATA: Amid the opposition's demand for proof on the Centre's claims of terror camp strikes in Pakistan, Union Minister SS Ahluwalia has said the purpose of the strike was not to cause human casualty but to send out the message that India is capable of hitting deep inside enemy lines. Ahluwalia said neither Prime Minister Narendra Modi nor any government spokesperson had given any figure on casualty of air strikes. Rather, it was the Indian media and social media where the unconfirmed figures of terrorist killed were being circulated, he said. ""I have seen reports in Indian media and international media and also what Modi-ji had said. After the air strike, there was a rally by Modi-ji and he didn't say anything on the casualty figures. I want to ask if Modi-ji, or any government spokesperson, or our party president Amit Shah has given any figures?"" he asked reporters in Siliguri on Saturday. The minister of state for electronics and information technology said the intention of the strike was to send out a message that India is capable of destruction in Pakistan's own backyard if needed. We didn't want any human casualty, he said. The video of Ahluwalia's comments was posted by the CPI(M) on its Twitter handle with a question: ""Is the Govt now backtracking from its claims that they took out a Terrorist Camp in Pakistan? (sic)"" When contacted, Ahluwalia reiterated that neither the government officials nor any minister has given out a figure of the casualties. ""I was asked whether I stand by the government's statement or by the reports of Indian media which have said 300-350 terrorists where killed. I stand by the government's statement. How can I vouch for media reports,"" he told PTI. The Darjeeling BJP MP's comments come in the wake of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee questioning the Modi government over the air strike.

" Air strike to avenge Pulwama is appropriate, but do not rule out escalation | India News - Times of India","Out of all the options available to India to respond to the Pulwama outrage it currently appears that it chose the most appropriate one. The word ‘currently’ is important here because in hybrid conflict situations oneoff acts do not bring an end to conflict. In fact, many times they exacerbate a situation. The appropriateness of the chosen Indian option appears correct because it did not stick to old wine in terms of a surface-based surgical strike like the last one in September 2016. The decision this time has taken the calibration many notches higher. The common understanding in the armed forces is that we can resort to various options within the spectrum of response but the moment we choose to get the Indian Air Force (IAF) to cross the border or the LoC with a targeted mission the escalation climbs higher to the extent of a nearwar-like situation. The Indian government in conjunction with the armed forces has obviously done a deep risk appreciation and concluded that an air strike by a reasonably large quantum of aircraft and armed appropriately with 1000 and 500 pound bombs would meet the needs of retribution being sought for the Pulwama attack. However, very correctly the decision remained limited to the old concept of 2016 with only terrorist infrastructure being targeted and not Pakistan military facilities or any other civilian infrastructure. Within this decision the choice could have been the large new Bahawalpur facility of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) or an equally important training and holding camp at Balakot deeper in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; the latter better approached through PoK. Bahawalpur carried greater risk of early engagement in Pakistan air space. The choice of going surgical again, against terrorist facilities suits Indian strategy. By choosing to escalate through targeting the Pakistan Army India would lose the support of the international community or at least weaken the traction gained in the diplomatic campaign. The decision to target terrorist facilities also maintains India’s moral ascendancy in the current situation. Damage assessment is yet to confirm the physical outcome of the air strike. Pakistan is attempting to downplay the Indian action by claiming that its own air force scrambled in response to force the Indian aircraft to return without meeting the intended aim of the strike. It also claims that the munitions were dropped randomly by the Indian aircraft with limited or no effect. Pakistan’s Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) arm has gone on an overdrive to push the information aspects in its favour. However, what is clear is that Indian aircraft entered Pakistan air space with impunity and returned to base safely without any challenge by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF). With PM Imran Khan and his numerous ministers having passionately warned India and promised that any military adventurism would be met with a Pakistan military response, it now puts the leadership under pressure. Whatever Pakistan decides to do, the onus of escalation clearly lies in its court. The DG ISPR is promising a very strong and appropriate response, obviously without spelling out what the options are. We may therefore assume that the Pakistan military’s ego will largely dictate what it intends to do. There is no similar terrorist infrastructure on the Indian side which it can target as a quid pro quo. If it chooses to escalate by targeting Indian military facilities or civilian infrastructure it would be counted as an act of war. Pakistan is economically in no position to sustain a warlike situation although it is not particularly known for rational thinking when it comes to choice of options. That is the reason due to which India cannot expect that this one-off action is the last we have seen in this escalating standoff. While risk may have been well calculated, the feasibility of contingencies leading to far higher levels of escalation is something India needs to be prepared for. The international community is already trying to de-escalate the crisis between the nuclear-armed neighbours. What India needs to do is ensure once again that political consensus is sought and maintained while ensuring the fullest support to the armed forces. There will be time to celebrate the achievements of our armed forces but under no circumstances must misplaced jingoism take the place of rational and cool thinking in the rapidly changing security environment.

"India Pakistan war: Air strike deep inside Pakistan, first since 1971 war | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: India conducted pre-dawn aerial strikes on a major Jaish-e-Mohammed terror training facility at Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region on Tuesday, breaking free of its self-imposed shackles in countering the cross-border proxy war fuelled by its hostile western neighbour for decades. The strikes came 12 days after the Pulwama terror attack claimed 40 CRPF troopers. This was the first time after the 1971 Indo-Pak war that IAF fighters deliberately crossed the Line of Control to pound targets. “The initial plan was not to cross the LoC because the JeM facility is just about 65 km away from there as the crow flies, and our weapons had significant stand-off ranges of 60-80-km,” a top defence source said. “But five to six Mirage-2000s did cross the LoC by over 10 km to let loose their weapons from 3.27 am onwards for a few minutes before turning back. All aircraft touched down at their home bases soon after 4 am,” he added. Twelve Mirage-2000 fighters, backed by four Sukhoi-30MKI jets for ‘air defence’ and two AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) aircraft as ‘eyes and ears of the strike package’, fired a mix of long-range Spice-2000 precision-guided bombs and AGM-142 (Popeye-2) missiles to destroy the sprawling Balakot facility, which housed over 300 terrorists, trainers and handlers. ‘Op like a well-choreographed ballet’The entire two-hour-long operation which started with the Mirage-2000 jets taking off from Gwalior and culminating in all IAF planes touching down at their home bases was like a well-choreographed ballet in the skies, with multiple aircraft from different directions coming together in the top-secret plan for the crosstal installations. Even as IAF jets undertake regular combat air patrols (CAPs) to prevent any ingress by enemy aircraft, different airbases are also maintaining round-the-clock ORPs (operational readiness platforms). The latter basically means some fighter pilots are always ready in their combat gear to scramble with their fully-armed jets within a few minutes.

Air strikes: Pakistan expresses reservation about OIC's invitation to India - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Tuesday that he has spoken to his UAE counterpart and ""expressed reservations"" about invitation to India's external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to attend the OIC meeting scheduled later this week. In a strategically significant development, India has been invited to the inaugural plenary of the foreign ministers' conclave of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a powerful grouping of Muslim majority nations, in Abu Dhabi from March 1 to 2. Swaraj will attend the meeting as the 'guest of honour'. Addressing a press conference here after a special meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) in the wake of India's air strikes inside Pakistan early Tuesday, Qureshi said the situation has changed now. ""Aggression has been done against a founding member of the OIC,"" he said, referring to the Indian attack that destroyed Jaish-e-Mohammed's biggest training camp in Balakot in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing a ""very large number"" of terrorists, trainers and commanders. The air strikes came 12 days after the JeM carried out the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 40 CRPF soldiers. Qureshi said that he has spoken to the foreign minister of the UAE and expressed Pakistan's reservations for inviting the Indian foreign minister as chief of guest in the OIC meeting. Describing the situation following the Indian air strikes as ""serious"", Qureshi said that Prime Minister Imran Khan also had telephonic conversations with UAE Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan as well as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the development. On the request of Pakistan, the OIC has summoned an emergency meeting of its Kashmir Contact Group at its General Secretariat on Tuesday, said local media reports, but there was no statement from the Foreign Office. The OIC is a grouping of 57 countries, majority of which are Muslim majority. It has usually been supportive of Pakistan and, often sided with Islamabad on the Kashmir issue.

" Modi govt lying on Balakot air strike, shooting down of Pak F-16: Farooq Abdullah | India News - Times of India","SRINAGAR: National Conference president Farooq Abdullah has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government of ""lying"" to the nation on the Balakot air strike and shooting down of a Pakistani F-16 in the aerial dogfight between the IAF and the PAF. Abdullah, who is contesting the Lok Sabha elections from the Srinagar constituency, said the BJP-led central government carried out the aerial strike as the Prime Minister had ""failed"" in delivering on his promises made during the last general elections in the country. ""He (Modi) had promised that Rs 15 lakh will be put in your accounts, did you get Rs 15 lakh? When he failed in all these things, his head was hanging whenever I used to see him in Parliament during the last few days as he realised that his power is gone. ""At that time, some MPs would say that he would do something...Attack Pakistan so that everyone feels that Hanuman ji has come. What did he do? For a few seconds, he sent three planes to the border which is known as Balakot and dropped bombs there,"" Abdullah said addressing an election rally in the Fakir Gujri area here Friday. The former chief minister said the government claimed that a number of terrorists were killed but there is no clarity. ""Some people said 500 were killed and some others even said 700 were killed. Here if one person is killed, the whole world comes to know. Would no one know if 300 were killed?"" he asked. On the report in a US journal that the US count claims no F-16 jet was shot down by IAF's MiG-21 Bison, Abdullah asked the prime minister why he was ""lying"" to the people of the country. ""He (Modi) said we shot down their (Pakistani) fighter plane F-16. Now, the US has come up saying all the Pakistani F-16s are counted. Not one has been shot down. There must be some basis for even lies, Modi ji. How long will you lie to people. And did you win (the battle)? Has Pakistan disappeared? Why are you lying? Do you think the Hindus will buy into all this?"" he said. Hoping that the BJP will not return to power at the Centre, Abdullah said whichever party comes to power ""they will definitely talk to Pakistan and Jammu & Kashmir will be the first priority"". ""We can't bear living like this ...That deaths take place everyday,"" he said. About the government's decision to ban public traffic on Jammu and Srinagar highway two days every week, Abdullah said the road was not even closed during Kargil war.

PM Modi ends Lok Sabha campaign with same pitch he started in Meerut - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday ended his election blitzkrieg at Khargone in Madhya Pradesh on the same note he started it 50-days ago in Meerut attacking Congress on the emotive issues of nationalism, armed forces and strikes across border and projecting his ""decisive government"". In his first rally after announcement of election dates in Meerut on March 28, Modi had said, ""It was this chowkidar's government that had the courage to conduct surgical strikes on land, sky and space. India should develop, India should be secure from enemies."" Maintaining the tempo, Modi again highlighted his ""decisive policy"" to eliminate terrorism and naxalism in Khargone. ""We have got strong support of people for our policies to eliminate terrorism and naxalism. This is the feeling of the country that the terrorists should be killed in their safe heavens ( ghar me ghus kar mara jaye),"" he said in Khargone on Friday. In a veiled reference to the Balakot strike, the Prime Minister asked the people in his signature style if they agree or not that killing terrorists in their homes is right, evoking a positive rapturous response from the crowd. ""Are you happy or not? When Modi kills (terrorists) in their homes, you feel proud or not. Your chests fill with pride or not. Your head is held high or not. Every Indian feel proud or not. This feeling has been answered by our brave sons. This should be the policy of new India,"" he said. The Prime Minister continued his attack on principal opposition Congress on the issues of security like he did in Meerut at the time of start of the campaign for the seven-phase general election, where he is seeking mandate to govern again. Playing on the words ' saboot' and ' sapoot', the Hindi words for proof and good son, he had attacked the opposition in Meerut for seeking evidence of the surgical strike. ""Do we need ' saboot' or sapoot... those who seek evidence are challenging the sapoot."" The theme remained unaltered in Khargone as well where he put Congress in a spot by taking up an alleged statement of Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy that those who don't get a square meal join the army and become soldiers. He urged the crowd to never vote of Congress which has made Kumaraswamy as chief minister saying the statement was an insult to tribal community youths who serve in the army not for bread but to brave the bullet. ""Congress has gone to people with promises of taking back special powers of soldiers, and repealing treason law that have been rejected by the country. The country is unanimous that people who support separate prime minister for Jammu and Kashmir should be served severe punishment,"" he said. Like in Meerut the Prime Minister continued to urge people to vote for ""him"" by pressing Lotus button on the EVM. ""Your five second in pressing Lotus button on EVM, you will have me in service for next five years,"" Modi said in Khargone. However, Prime Minister did not assert ""Chowkidar"" in his speech in Khargone while it was a key highlight in Meerut where he had said,""I will give all answers and I will also seek answers. As you know I am your 'Chowkidar', I will want answers for what they did in 70 years."" ""On one side there is 'dumdar chowkidar' whereas the opposition is full of daagdaars,"" he had said in Meerut. Modi also sought to highlight the freedom struggle link of the places where he held his first and last rally of this Lok Sabha poll campaign. ""My election campaign started from Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. Now the last rally is happening in Khargone, Madhya Pradesh. From a historical perspective, there is a connection between Meerut and Khargone, which is often not noticed. Both the cities are associated with the 1857 War of Independence,"" he said. Both the cities have inspired nationalism, Modi added. ""In Meerut, Indian soldiers rebelled against the British and in Khargone, freedom fighter Bhima Nayak led a tribal agitation and attained martyrdom,"" he said. ""The election of 2019 is different from all the previous general elections. In this poll, people of India are voting for their country and not for any party. They are voting to build a New India,"" Modi said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."
 IAF achieved military objective in Balakot op; Pakistani side did not come into our airspace: Dhanoa | India News - Times of India,"GWALIOR: Pakistani Air Force side did not enter into Indian airspace after the Balakot airstrike, Air Marshal B S Dhanoa on Monday said while asserting that the IAF ""achieved its military objective"" in the operation while Pakistan did not. He said this in response to a question at a press conference held during a day-long event at the Gwalior Air Base to mark 20 years of the Kargil War. ""They didn't come into our airspace. And what was our objective? Our objective was to strike the (terror) camp and we have done that. We have achieved our objective. Their (Pakistani) objective was to hit our army places. They could not and that is the bottom line,"" he said. Dhanoa asserted that the IAF achieved its stated military objective but the Pakistani side did not. ""But none of them (PAF side) crossed the LoC into our side,"" he told reporters. The IAF Monday also organised a seminar on 'Air operations in Kargil war, lessons learnt and way forward' at the Gwalior Air Force Station. The Air Force had struck a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot area on February 26 in response to the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. The Pakistan Air Force retaliated the next day by unsuccessfully targeting various military installations in Jammu and Kashmir. Asked about the airspace being closed from the Pakistani side, Dhanoa said, ""They deciding to close the airspace is their problem."" ""Our economy is vibrant and air traffic is a very important part and you have noticed that the Air Force has never stopped our civilian air traffic,"" he said. ""Only on February 27, we had stopped Srinagar airspace for two-three hours. We did not allow tension with Pakistan to dictate our civil aviation because our economy is much bigger and much stronger as compared to theirs,"" he added. Praising the Mirage-2000, the IAF chief recalled how the use of the aircraft equipped with laser-guided bombs, coupled with the ground forces had turned the tide of the war. In Balakot operation too Mirage-2000 aircraft, equipped with SPICE bomb, after taking off from the Gwalior Base, had pounded the JeM camp. Referring to the Kargil conflict, Dhanoa said Mirage aircraft of the IAF carried out effective strikes on Pakistani infiltrators. ""We stand by the people who achieved this. Pakistan did not have beyond visual range missile. When you have an element of surprise by your side then you can make success. Purpose of our attack has always been to show our resolve and capability,"" Dhanoa said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

Rahul Gandhi taunts PM Modi over claim on cloud cover during air strike - Times of India,"NEEMUCH: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remarks that cloud cover ""helped"" IAF planes evade Pakistani radars during the Balakot strikes. Addressing an election rally here ahead of the fourth and last phase of Lok Sabha polls in Madhya Pradesh, Gandhi also sought to know what did Modi do for the jobless youth. ""Modi ji, whenever it rains in India, do all aircraft disappear from the radar,"" Gandhi said. The Congress leader also made a veiled reference to Modi's interaction with actor Akshay Kumar in which the PM revealed that he loved mangoes as a child and still loves them. ""Modi ji, you taught (us) how to eat mangoes; now tell the country what you did for jobless youth,"" he said. Gandhi said his party's proposed minimum income guarantee scheme Nyay will jump start the Indian economy and set right the ""injustice"" done due to GST and demonetisation. The economy has been left in the doldrums due to flawed GST implementation and demonetisation. ""The Nyay scheme will benefit five crore families who earn less than Rs 12,000 per month. This means Rs 72,000 will be deposited in the bank accounts of beneficiaries annually and Rs 3.6 lakh in five years,"" he said. Demonetisation and GST have left lakhs of people unemployed and small and medium enterprises have been left in the lurch, Gandhi said. ""The Nyay scheme will ensure that people start purchasing goods, while small and medium businesses can start manufacturing the goods resulting in employment opportunities,"" he said.

" CPM leader speaks in Imran Khan’s voice, casts aspersions on air strikes | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: At a time when Indian politicians cutting across party lines praised the pre-dawn air strikes by Indian Air Force (IAF) at Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) terror camps at Balakot in Pakistan on Tuesday, a senior Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPM] leader stunned all by attributing motives at the Modi government. Addressing a party rally hours after the air strikes at Idukki in Kerala, state CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said, ""The BJP government, which fears defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, is trying to polarise communities through war mongering."" Seeking to politicise the ‘Surgical Strikes 2.0’, Balakrishnan further said, ""Instead of finding a solution to the insurgency in Kashmir, the BJP government is trying to make things worse by making the people of Kashmir enemies of the state."" Balakrishnan’s remarks over the air strikes were in stark contrast to those of other politicians such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah. Except for Balakrishnan, all other politicians hailed the IAF strikes and the government’s preemptive action in destroying terror camps in the wake of the Pulwama attack by a suicide bomber of the JeM. In fact, Balakrishnan’s remarks were closer to what Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan remarked. “The airstrike was conducted for domestic consumption in an election year,” the Pakistan PM had said on Tuesday. However, Balakrishnan’s remarks may not be surprising as the CPI(M) is known to have a different view from the national narrative over crucial issues in the past. For instance, it supported Communist China during India’s war with that country in 1962. It even opposed donation of blood to the Indian soldiers who had suffered injuries in the war. The party had also opposed the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru and has always censured it. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Pakistan extends airspace ban along its eastern border with India till June 28 - Times of India,"LAHORE: Pakistan on Thursday extended its airspace ban along its eastern border with India for the third time till June 28, according to a notice issued by the country's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Pakistan fully closed its airspace on February 26 after the Indian Air Force struck a Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) terrorist training camp in Balakot. Since then, it has only opened two routes, both of them pass through southern Pakistan, of the total 11. Pakistan's civil aviation authority is expected to review the situation on June 15. The IAF announced on May 31 that all temporary restrictions imposed on Indian airspace post the Balakot airstrike have been removed. The CAA notice issued to airmen (NOTAM) on Thursday says: ""Pakistani airspace will be closed until June 28 along its eastern border with India. The Panjgoor airspace will remain open for overflying transit flights from the western side as Air India had already been using that airspace."" A Pakistan government official told PTI that since there has been no official communication between the two countries regarding opening of their airspace for each other the ""status quo"" will prevail. ""See if some development takes place at the government's level in this respect before June 28,"" he said. On Wednesday Pakistan gave a special permission to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's VVIP flight to use its airspace for his official trip to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. However Modi's flight avoided flying over Pakistan. Earlier, Pakistan had allowed India's (former) External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to fly directly though Pakistani airspace to participate in the meeting of SCO foreign ministers in Bishkek on May 21. Pakistan earlier had indicated that it may lift the airspace ban along its eastern border with India imposed on February 27 to reciprocate India's decision to remove all restrictions on all air routes in the Indian airspace. As a result of the ban, foreign carriers using Indian airspace have been forced to take costly detours because they cannot fly over Pakistan. The closure mainly affects flights from Europe to Southeast Asia. The flights from Europe and the US flying in and out of New Delhi have been the worst hit. Since Pakistan's airspace closure, the airfare on many routes have gone up significantly, including Delhi-Kabul, Delhi-Moscow, Delhi-Tehran and Delhi-Astana.

US INdia:   India may go for only naval UAVs from US | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Aug 28, 2019)NEW DELHI: India is likely to buy only naval surveillance drones from the United States, scaling back its plans after holding talks on acquiring armed Predator drones under the foreign military sales route. The two sides have been discussing a $2 billion deal for unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) but a lack of interest from the Indian Air Force and commitment to an indigenous programme by the Indian Army are likely to come in the way, people aware of the matter told ET on condition of anonymity. The Indian Navy has an interest in acquiring US-made surveillance drones as it needs more assets for maritime domain awareness in the region, said the people. However, this requirement is for a long endurance, unarmed drone that can work in coordination with other surveillance platforms like the Boeing P8I aircraft, they said. The navy is likely to go ahead with a limited purchase option of 10 Sea Guardian drones that are interoperable with other US assets in the region. The activation of the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) will help the navy exploit the platforms for joint surveillance and intelligence sharing. Officials said the air force has not been keen on an offer of 10 armed Predator or Avenger drones from the US as it finds their cost prohibitive and does not see them useful in the context of its operational role in the region. An armed drone would have been of little help in an operation like the Balakot air strikes, said an expert, since the relatively low speed aircraft would have given the enemy enough warning to launched counter measures. Besides, drones are easy to shoot down in enemy airspace with anti-aircraft systems and the air force feels that resources could be better utilised by shoring up fighter jet strength in the fleet. “These drones cost almost as much as a Rafale fighter jet and are not equipped to operate in a contested air space scenario like the one we are in,” said an official. The air force is also committed to a project with Israel to upgrade and weaponise the Heron drones that are already in service. Similarly, there has not been keen interest by the army on a proposal to acquire 10 of the armed drones as it is committed to an indigenous project by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The army has pledged to procure over 80 of the Rustom 2 drones that are under development and are being weaponised by the DRDO. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Integration of Brahmos missiles on Sukhoi jets to be fast-tracked | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Weeks after the Balakot air strikes, the government decided to fast-track integration of the Brahmos supersonic cruise missile on over 40 Sukhoi fighter jets, a closely guarded strategic project aimed at bolstering combat capability of the Indian Air Force, official sources said on Sunday. They said the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and the BrahMos Aerospace Ltd were told to expedite implementation of the project so that it can be completed much before the scheduled deadline of December 2020. In 2016, the government had decided to integrate the air-launched variant of the Brahmos, the world's fastest supersonic cruise missile, into over 40 Sukhoi fighter jets. Though actual work on the project started by end of 2017, its implementation has been very slow, the sources said. A review on ways to strengthen the IAF was carried out in the backdrop of the Balakot air strikes and subsequent Pakistani retaliation and it was felt that the early integration of Brahmos on Sukhoi jet should be a priority, they said. It was felt that the planned induction of Rafale aircraft with deadly Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM), procurement of S-400 air defence missile system and integration of Brahmos on Sukhoi will provide India a significant advantage over Pakistani Air Force. There was a view in the IAF that if it possessed high levels of ""technological asymmetry"", then it would have been able to inflict heavy damage on Pakistan during the adversary's unsuccessful aerial raid on February 27. The government is undertaking several measures to strengthen the IAF's combat prowess, the sources said, adding the HAL has been specifically told to put additional manpower and resources to fast-track the Brahmos project. Once the project to integrate the weapon on the combat fleet was over, the IAF's capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target in sea or land is expected to go up manifold. The missile coupled with the superlative performance of the Sukhoi aircraft will give the IAF a strategic reach and will allow it to dominate the ocean and the battle fields, according to an assessment by the IAF. The air-launched variant of the Brahmos was successfully test fired from a Sukhoi-30 combat jet on November 22, 2017, marking a major milestone to enhance the precision strike capability of the air force. A fleet of 40 Sukhoi jet are undergoing structural modifications at the state-run aerospace major Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) for integration of the missile on them. The 2.5-ton missile flies almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8 and has a range of 290 km. The range of the missile, an Indo-Russia joint venture, can be extended up to 400 km as certain technical restrictions were lifted after India became a full member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) last year. Brahmos missile is the heaviest weapon to be deployed on India's Su-30 fighter aircraft. The integration of the missile on Sukhoi aircraft is a very complex process involving mechanical, electrical and software modifications of the Su-30 jet, officials said.

 Indian Air Force's Abhinandan Varthaman starts flying MiG 21 | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, the IAF pilot who became the face of a tense military confrontation between India and Pakistan in February, has started flying MiG 21 jet again. Varthaman returned to the fighter cockpit, nearly six months after sustaining injuries while ejecting from a fighter plane during an aerial combat between India and Pakistan on February 27. ""He has started flying,"" said a top military official. At present, Varthaman is serving at an IAF base in Rajasthan. The 36-year-old IAF pilot was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat. Before his jet was hit, he downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan. Varthaman was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan. He had sustained injuries while ejecting from his MiG 21 Bison during the aerial combat and was taken off flying duties because of it. Varthaman was conferred Vir Chakra, the coveted wartime gallantry medal, for downing the F-16 jet of Pakistan during the aerial combat. Vir Chakra is the third highest gallantry award after the Paramvir Chakra and the Mahavir Chakra. IAF's Bengaluru-based Institute of Aerospace Medicine has given the go-ahead to Varthaman to fly again following a thorough medical evaluation around three weeks back. Days after he returned from Pakistan, Varthaman conveyed to IAF brass his wish to return to fighter cockpit at the earliest. After he was captured, Varthaman showed courage and grace in handling the most difficult circumstances for which he was praised by politicians, strategic affairs experts, ex-servicemen, celebrities and people in general. The IAF pilot underwent a nearly two-week-long debriefing by security agencies following his return from Pakistan. IAF fighter jets bombed a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26, nearly two weeks after the Pulwama strike. Pakistan retaliated on February 27 by attempting to target Indian military installations. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Will work for you and succeed: Defence minister tells Armed Forces veterans | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday assured the Armed Forces veterans that the government would have regular interactions with them and work with complete dedication to resolve their issues.

His statement comes amidst much heartburn in the veteran community over a move to tax the disability pension. The defence minister heaped praise on the valour, fighting and sacrificial spirit of the Indian soldiers during the Kargil War as also in the earlier wars, the statement said. Referring to his visit to Dras on July 20 and recalling the stories of immense courage and ultimate sacrifices made by the valiant soldiers during the Kargil war, Singh said that soldiers had fought against all odds, in the face of enemy fire from the heights, to re-take one peak after another.

Rajnath Singh brings up Balakot at Palamu | Ranchi News - Times of India,"DALTONGANJ/HAZARIBAG: Ignoring the opposition’s allegations that BJP is politicizing the armed forces, Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi sat in a huddle for two days to chalk out the strategy for Indian Air Force’s (IAF) strikes in Balakot, Pakistan, in February. Addressing a rally at Karpoori Maidan in Hussainabad, Singh said: “PM Modi and I deliberated about our plan of action for two days. Then, at 3am the next day, Air Force scripted history.” Singh was canvassing for BJP’s Palamu candidate V D Ram. Singh’s visit came hours before Modi’s scheduled road show in Ranchi. Singh recalled the achievements of Indian scientists and the country’s growing importance on the global stage. “Under Modi’s leadership, India is emerging as a taqatwar desh (powerful country) like USA, Russia and China,” he said. Ridiculing opposition parties for seeking proof in the aftermath of Balakot strikes, Singh said the IAF’s job was to hit the targets and not count the bodies and the objective was completed. He said: After the Pulwama terror attack, all the countries stood with India, whose policy is not to fire the first bullet, but respond strongly to any bullet fired at it”. “Our leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was then in the opposition, had praised the then PM Indira Gandhi after the 1971 war against Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh. But now that Modi had taken a big step, the opposition leaders are raising questions instead of praising him,” he said Singh praised the government’s pro-poor schemes such as PM Awas Yojna, Ujjwala Yojna and others. “Every Indian must see the status of the PM Awas Yojana to understand the real indicators of development. While only 25 lakh houses were built till 2014, more than 1.3 crore houses have been built since 2014 under Modi’s leadership,” said Singh. Singh also said that Naxalism will be rooted out in the country by 2023. Naxals have been almost eliminated in Jharkhand and their remaining pockets in the state will end soon, he said. Singh said JMM and Congress have joined hands in the state due to their lust for power but they will not be successful in achieving their aim. “There is no leader in the opposition to match the stature of Modi and other leaders are “dwarfs” compared to him,” he said Addressing another rally in the neighbouring Chatra Lok Sabha constituency for BJP's Sunil Kumar Singh, Saingh said ‘garibi-mukt Bharat’ can only be possibble only when there is a Congress-mukt Bharat. “In the last five years, the BJP-led NDA government made notable achievements in opening bank accounts for the poor, building roads, distribution of gas cylinders and its housing scheme and .5 crore people were taken out of poverty,”he said.

There was condolence in Opposition camps during Balakot air strikes: BJP chief Amit Shah - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday lashed out at the Congress and SP-BSP combine accusing them of condoling the death of terrorists during air strikes on terror camps in Balakot following the Pulwama attack in Kashmir earlier this year. Addressing a gathering in Ghazipur, Shah said that while the air strikes in Balakot led to cheers and celebrations across the country there was ‘Matam’ (condolence) in just two camps. “One in Pakistan and the other in Congress. Even Bua (BSP chief Mayawati) Bhatija (SP president Akhilesh Yadav) expressed their grief over the death of terrorists,” Shah said during the Vijay Sankalp rally in Ghazipur where BJP has fielded union minister Manoj Sinha. Shah said that the BJP government had no intention of doing ‘ilu ilu’ with the terrorists who targetted the Indian territory in Kashmir. “Agar Pakistan se goli aayegi toh Hum uska jawab goley se denge... (if Pakistan fires a bullet then the Indian government would retaliate with a cannon ball),” Shah said. The BJP chief also hit out at the opposition camp for asking the India to initiate talks with the Pakistan government. “Rahul Gandhi’s advisor Sam Pitroda asks the government to initiate talks. I want to tell Rahul Baba that they should restrict their policies to themselves,” he said, adding that the BJP government would continue to hit back if terror attacks continued Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."
N-deterrence helped de-escalate tensions during Pulwama crisis: Pak official - Times of India,"ISLAMABAD: Nuclear deterrence led to the de-escalation of tensions during the post-Pulwama military stand-off between India and Pakistan, a senior official associated with Pakistan's nuclear programme said here Friday. Brigadier Zahir Kazmi, director general Arms Control and Disarmament Affairs at Strategic Plans Division (SPD) told journalists that the stated purpose of deterrence was to close space for war and bring states to the negotiating table. ""Stability actually means peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the subcontinent... nuclear deterrence should be a factor of stability between Pakistan and Hindustan,"" The Express Tribune quoted him as saying during a media interaction with senior Pakistani officials dealing with strategic affairs. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the February 14 Pulwama attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) terror group which killed 40 CRPF personnel. Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting a JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The next day, Pakistan air force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured an Indian pilot, who was handed over to India on March 1. Brig Kazmi said deterrence worked during the post-Pulwama military stand-off despite India's attempt to escalate to a different level by talking about mobilisation of nuclear missile and nuclear submarines. He clarified that deterrence was not an end in itself but a psychological state. ""It should inspire fear in which the perceived cost of deterrence breakdown is higher than the desired benefits of preferring war as an instrument for dispute resolution,"" the report quoted him as saying. The director general Arms Control and Disarmament, ministry of foreign affairs, Muhammad Kamran Akhtar said that Pakistan demonstrated a more responsible and restrained behaviour during the standoff that led to de-escalation. He claimed that Pakistan was a responsible and restrained nuclear power and the country's safety and security record was immaculate and an example for many countries. At the media interaction organised by Islamabad Policy Institute, Akhtar dismissed the allegations that Pakistan possessed the fastest growing nuclear programme in the world. Defense analyst Syed Muhammad Ali said Pakistan's nuclear programme had significantly contributed towards meeting both its traditional and non-traditional security needs. Nuclear deterrence, he added, had enabled Pakistan timely manage and de-escalate several regional crises with India during the past three decades. This, he said, also gave Pakistan's leadership and diplomats more confidence in international diplomacy Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News."
 Opposition parties making a fool of themselves asking for proof of casualties in air strikes: Puri | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has demonstrated India’s capacity to go “100 km inside Pakistan” and use sophisticated weapons to destroy the terror camps, Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Saturday. The minister said the opposition parties were making a “fool” of themselves by asking for proof. Puri was responding to questions from media persons on the demands of opposition leaders seeking the details of casualties at Balakot. “No one doubted the air strikes carried out by Indian Air Force and that the government was not obliged to give any evidence. I feel very sorry for the people who are making such demands. Our PM has demonstrated that we have the capacity to go inside Pakistan...We went in there, got the (JeM) facility. We used aircraft and precision guided ammunition which had the precise coordinates. More than 80% of such ammunition hit the target and they had warheads with deep penetration which pierced through and exploded inside the target. Let the fools complete the process of demanding the proof,” the minister said on the sidelines of inaugurating country’s first Urban Observatory. He also asked why Pakistan has been barring journalists from visit the sites, if it’s so confident that there was no impact. In an apparent reference to Congress, the minister said, “Those who are accusing us are representatives of a political party which ruled India for most of the 70 years and became victims of the doctrine of strategic restraint which means that because we are nuclear power, we cannot defend ourselves.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" We shot them down once, will shoot them down again, says Squadron Leader Minty Aggarwal | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: IAF fighter-controller Squadron Leader Minty Aggarwal was on duty when over 20 Pakistan Air Force (PAF) fighters attacked Indian Army establishments on February 27, the day after Balakot strikes. She saw the dogfight as also Wing Commander Abhinandan Vartaman firing at Pak F-16 before vanishing from her radar screen. “I don’t have words to explain the feeling,” says Sqn Ldr Aggarwal, 31, who will be awarded Yudh Seva Medal for her contribution in repulsing the PAF raid. In the hot seat when the PAF raid began, she saw her entire screen light up; there were red dots — enemy aircraft — everywhere. “As a fighter-controller, it is my duty and responsibility to not just guide an aircraft...but to provide a weapon solution and to achieve a lock-on so that the missile can be launched. At the same time, we have to keep in mind that my aircraft are safe.” “I was controlling Wing Commander Abhinandan since the time he was airborne. I provided him the air situation picture. During the aerial engagement, he was informed about the aircraft posture and he (attacked) the most appropriate target. I was monitoring the whole situation. And then, I saw the F-16 vanishing from my screen,” she said. Asked if the red light (the F-16) vanished from the screen, she said “Exactly”. But there was no time to celebrate. She wasn’t controlling just one IAF fighter. “It is a dynamic situation. I had to concentrate. We are all air warriors. We have to move on. I was controlling other missions also. So, I kept vectoring the other aircraft towards the enemy aircraft.” A MiG-21 Bison shooting down an F-16 is “a very big thing”, she said. It speaks of “the training plan of our academies” and how competent IAF pilots, controllers and air crew are. It was a very determined Pakistani attack on Army establishments, Sqn Ldr Aggarwal said. “They could not damage our military installations.” While insisting that defeating the PAF was a team effort, she said: “I feel (I was) chosen by God. I was lucky to be a part of that team. If given a chance, I will again perform... I request God to give me the energy to perform in the same dedicated and professional manner.” Sqn Ldr Aggarwal remembers “losing the blip of Wing Commander Abhinandan” when his MiG-21 went down. But there were no other losses, and certainly not a Su-30 that Pakistan has talked about. “I was monitoring the airspace and all our Su-30s are available to us,” she said, adding that India just lost one MiG-21. Like everyone else, she was overjoyed when Wing Commander Abhinandan returned. “I cannot explain that moment in words. Definitely, it was a moment of great happiness not only for me but the entire nation.” And February 27 isn’t just the final blow, she said. “That was a moment we were waiting for and I pray to God that...I am given the chance... we have shot them once and we will shoot them again.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
Abhinandan Varthaman:   IAF recommends Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman for Vir Chakra | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The IAF has recommended Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman for a top wartime gallantry award, while also transferring him out of the Srinagar to another base on the western front till he is found medically fit to fly again. Defence sources said Varthaman, who shot down a F-16 before his MiG-21 was also downed during the aerial skirmish with Pakistan Air Force on February 27, has been recommended for a Vir Chakra, which is the third highest wartime medal after Param Vir Chakra and Maha Vir Chakra. Varthaman, of course, was later released on March 1 after being captured by the Pakistan Army on February 27. The Mirage-2000 pilots who conducted the “successful” bombing of the main Jaish-e-Mohammed facility at Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in the pre-dawn air strikes on February 26, in turn, have been recommended for Vayu Sena (gallantry) medals. Though the IAF refused to comment officially, sources said Varthaman was “routinely transferred”’ to another airbase in Rajasthan and not because of any security concerns for his safety in J&K. “His tenure with the IAF’s No.51 squadron, also called the ‘Sword Arms’, was getting over. Moreover, the final clearance for him to fly again will be given by the Bengaluru-based Institute of Aerospace Medicine, where he will undergo tests next month,” said a source. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa had earlier said that whether the 35-year-old Varthaman flies again would depend on his medical fitness because ejection from a supersonic fighter leads to stress and other injuries on the pilot’s spinal cord. ""Once he gets his medical fitness, then only he can get into a fighter cockpit,"" he said. Another official on Saturday said, “As for the gallantry medals, the IAF headquarters is yet to collate all the awards to be conferred on August 15. It’s a confidential process. The medals are officially announced only after the President inks the file.” Repeatedly rubbishing Pakistan’s claims, the IAF has reiterated that it has very credible evidence that not only did Pakistan deploy F-16s in the intended strike on Indian military installations across the Line of Control on February 27, but also that one of the US-origin jets was shot down by the MiG-21 being flown by Varthaman. The evidence marshalled by the IAF ranges from “electronic signatures” captured by an Indian Phalcon AWACs aircraft and ground radar stations to intercepted radio transmissions among Pak Army units and “physical sightings” of two parachutes coming down in the Sabz Kot and Tandar areas around 8-10 km apart in PoK (Pakistan occupied Kashmir). The fate of the Pakistani pilot shot down is still unknown. Pakistan had backtracked after initially declaring that a second pilot, apart from Varthaman, had been admitted to a military hospital after being injured after ejecting from his jet.

"If Indiraji is credited for 1971 Bangladesh war, why not Modi for the Balakot air strike : Rajnath Singh - Times of India","BHUBANESWAR: Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi deserves the credit for the country's air strike inside Pakistan just as Indira Gandhi was honoured for the success in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Singh, a BJP stalwart, hit out at the Congress for seeking evidence of the outcome of the Balakot air strike by Indian Air Force and said the BJP-led government has been able to effectively isolate Pakistan for sheltering terror elements. He recounted that former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who was a leader of the Jan Sangh, the former avatar of BJP, had complimented Indira Gandhi for the success in the Bangladesh Liberation war and had said the party would not hesitate to accord its fullest cooperation to Indira Gandhi. ""Now, what is wrong in praising Modiji if he gave a fitting reply to Pakistan after the Pulwama terror attack ?"" Singh asked while slamming the opposition parties for raising questions when there was nation-wide ""euphoria"" following the air strike on terror camps inside Pakistan territory. Singh was addressing a series of election meetings in Keonjhar, Cuttack and Puri parliamentary constituencies in Odisha which are going to polls in the third phase on April 23 to bolster the prospects of BJP candidates. ""The opposition has been seeking to know the number of terrorists killed in the air strike. How can the jawans count the number when the target is a huge gathering of terrorists? ... Jawans do not count bodies, it is the work of vultures."" Claiming that the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been able to isolate Pakistan in the international community, Singh said ""None other than Narendra Modi can give a befitting reply to Pakistan."" He strongly criticised the then Congress government for not taking action against Pak-based terrorists after the Mumbai atttack in 2008. The Modi government had on the other hand acted promptly and launched an attack on terrorist camps at Balakot in Pakistan within 13 days of the Pulwama attack. ""This is the difference between BJP and the Congress,"" Singh said. Stating that India is no more weak, the senior BJP leader said ""We do not attack any one but if some one attacks us, we do not spare him. ""Our policy is very clear. We do not attack any one, never try to acquire anyone's territory. But if anyone dares to hit us we will not sit idle,"" Singh said, Apart from strengthening the country's security, Modi has ensured that country's economy improved. ""When BJP came to power in 2014, India's position in terms of economy was 9th. Now within four and half years, India's place is 6th in the world. We will be among the top three by 2030,"" he said. Singh urged the people to vote for BJP to ensure speedy development and appealed for the ouster of the BJD government in Odisha for failing to pull the state out of backwardness and poverty. The BJD government of Naveen Patnaik is seeking re-election for the fifth straight time in Odisha, where simultanoeus polls for the Lok Sabha and the assembly are on.

 Congress asks PM Modi to come out with truth on number of terrorists killed in Balakot air strikes | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Two days after union minister S S Ahluwalia said neither Prime Minister Narendra Modi nor any government spokesperson had given any figure on the casualty of Balakot air strikes, the Congress Monday asked the Prime Minister to come out with the truth on the number of terrorists killed. ""Modi-ji, your central government ministers are stating that TV channels' news is fake, stating that the Prime Minister never stated that 300 terrorists were killed during the Balakot air strike. Is this true? If no, the Prime Minister should tell the truth. Regards, citizens of country,"" said Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala in a tweet Monday. Minister of state for electronics and information technology, S S Ahluwalia, said Saturday in Siliguri that neither Modi nor any government spokesperson had given any figure on the casualty of air strikes. Rather, the Indian media and social media users were circulating an unconfirmed figure of terrorists killed, he said. ""I have seen reports in Indian media and international media and also what Modi-ji had said. After the air strike, there was a rally by Modi-ji and he didn't say anything on the casualty figures. I want to ask if Modi-ji, or any government spokesperson, or our party president Amit Shah has given any figure?"" he asked reporters in Siliguri on Saturday. The Darjeeling BJP MP's comments come in the wake of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee questioning the Modi government over the air strike.

Indian Air Force’s Squadron Leader Minty Agarwal will be conferred with the Yudh Seva Medal for her role as a fighter controller during the February 27 aerial conflict. The Mirage-2000 pilots who conducted the successful bombing of the main Jaish-e-Mohammed facility at Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in the pre-dawn air strikes on February 26, in turn, will be awarded with Vayu Sena (gallantry) medals. Varthaman's name was recommended by the IAF for the gallantry awards annually conferred upon on Independence day. The 35-year-old Wing Commander was flying a MiG-21 Bison when he shot Pakistan's F-16. Seconds after Varthaman made the historic kill of an F-16 by a MiG-21, his own fighter aircraft was hit by Pakistan's missile and he was forced to eject. He landed on Pakistan's territory and was captured. After staying in Pakistan's captivity for almost 60 hours, the IAF hero was returned to India on March 1.

 IAF strikes took place in Pakistan but 'compulsive contrarians' found new 'Balakote' in Poonch: Jaitley | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said ""compulsive contrarians discovered a new Balakote"" which lies within Indian territory and without checking facts referred to it as the target of the Indian Air Force when it struck the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot in Pakistan's Khyber Paktunkhwa province. He also took a sharp dig at news channels, saying they are increasingly resorting to ""agenda setting"" instead of reporting. ""When our Air Force reached Balakot in KPK, before one could gather any information someone started saying it is very close to the LoC (Line of Control) and some people whom I call compulsive contrarians discovered a new Balakote without even checking that, that particular Balakote is not across the LOC but in our own Poonch."" ""Why will our own Air Force attack our own territory,"" Jaitley said at a function here to release a book titled 'Mann Ki Baat - A Social Revolution on Radio' here which is based on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's monthly radio broadcast. The minister of finance and corporate affairs said those in public life have to use alternative modes to communicate directly with people, as news channels increasingly resort to ""agenda setting"" instead of reporting. This, he said, presents a golden opportunity for print media and radio to strike back and regain its place. ""From the mid-90s private television channels started. Initially they had panel discussions, some news bulletins and thereafter the competition which began (amongst them) has a very small universe, that now setting the agenda is our job. ""The conventional role of the media was to report and present views on the editorial page, but (now) we will not report the country's agenda but set it,"" Jaitley said. He said since this journey began one has to search with a remote for news while the agenda is everywhere. ""I recall when Prime Minister Narendra Modi became chief minister of Gujarat in 2001, there were (state) polls in 2002 and at the time the local media and national media was not exactly a friend of his. It was very aggressive against him. ""I was looking after those elections on behalf of my party (BJP). Even at that time the strategy was that when there is agenda setting instead of reporting, you cannot communicate with people through this medium,"" Jaitley said. Jaitley said that Mann Ki Baat programme addressed by the prime minister has a strong power of recall which leaves deep footprints in the minds of its listeners. He highlighted the power of radio, its impact as a source of both news and entertainment, its huge geographical reach and as a mode of learning language. Jaitley said Prime Minister Modi started using the medium of radio for governmental communication in order to establish direct communication with people by identifying its wide reach. The book sheds light on various aspects of Prime Minister's outreach, the remarkable response it continuously received from the people, the mass movement it has inspired and the profound impact it ingrained in the minds and hearts of the youth of India, an official release said. It also gives insight into behind the scene research work done on the massive public feedback received through various channels after every episode of Mann Ki Baat, which had aired first on October 3, 2014, it said.

People have right to know truth behind Balakot strike: CM Ashok Gehlot | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JODHPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said here on Friday that people have the right to know about the truth behind Balakot strike by IAF. He said that when foreign media is raising questions about the strike, why should not the government clarify to shut them up. “World media has been claiming that nothing has been found on the ground as claimed by India and creating confusion over the incident. Should the people have right to know and should not the government come out with clarification so that the rumours and confusion could be put to end,” said Gehlot. Gehlot was talking to media in Jodhpur on Friday after a day’s visit to border areas with BSF officials and paying obeisance at the shrine of the folk deity Baba Ramdeo on Thursday. He said that instead of this, every other person from the ruling party is engaged in tossing different versions which has been further intensifying the confusion and distrust. “Those in power should address this suspicion instead of leveraging the incident for targeting opposition and winning election,” Gehlot commented ascribing them as thug who have been doing nothing but confusing the people on the facts about the Balakot strike. He further alleged that only two persons have been ruling the country today referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah. “Both of them have just been diverting the attention of the national discourse in order to win the election,” he said. “People have understood what has been happening around and would reply by their votes in the election,” he added. He said that in such a situation, the behaviour expression of prime minster, both in words and demeanour, should be highly responsible and fraternal. “In such a situation, statements of the prime minister should be such which could infuse trust, boost confidence and strengthen unity among the country and fellow men. But instead of this, he has behaved very irresponsibly both in words and demeanour,” Gehlot alleged. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Clouds do prevent radars from detecting accurately: Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar | India News - Times of India,"BHATINDA: A top Indian Air Force official on Monday defended Prime Minister's Narendra Modi recent assertion that a rainy day was a better pick for Balakot strikes as the clouds could help fighter jets evade detection by Pakistani radars during the operation, by saying ""very strong clouds and very strong convective conditions in clouds prevent the radar from detecting very accurately"". Modi made the remarks in a recent TV interview. ""That is true up to some effect that very strong clouds and very strong convective conditions in clouds prevent the radar from detecting very accurately"", said Commanding-in-Chief, Western Air Command, Raghunath Nambiar while talking to ANI. The officer was asked to react on Army Chief General Bipin Rawat's remarks yesterday in Kerala where he had defended Prime Minister's comments in this regard. ""There are various kinds of radars working with different technologies. Some have the capacity to see through, some don't have the capacity to see through. Some kinds of radar cannot see through clouds because of the manner in which it is operating. Sometimes we can, sometimes we can't,"" Rawat had reportedly said. ""The weather suddenly turned bad, there were clouds... heavy rain. There was a doubt about whether we can go in the clouds. During a review (of the Balakot plan), by and large, the opinion of experts was - what if we change the date. I had two issues in mind. One was secrecy, second, I said I am not someone who knows the science. I said there is so much cloud and rain. There is a benefit. I have raw wisdom, the clouds can benefit us too. We can escape the radar. Everyone was confused. Ultimately I said there are clouds... let's proceed,"" the Prime Minister had stated in an interview during election campaigning. Twelve Mirage 2000s had crossed over to Pakistan on February and attacked a JeM terrorist training camp in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avenge the deadly Pulwama attack in which 44 CRPF personnel were killed.

"Two aircraft tail strikes in two days, luckily all safe - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Two aircraft have suffered tail strikes on landing in last two days. An Air India Express (AI-Ex) Boeing 737 bounced slightly on touch down at Calicut and then had a tail strike on Monday. And in the other case, a GoAir Airbus A320 suffered this on landing at Ranchi Sunday (June 30). Luckily, in both incidents no one on board was injured and the aircraft involved were also not damaged. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing these two incidents of tail strikes. The AI-Ex flight was coming in from Dammam as IX 382 with about 190 people on board. “After touching down, the aircraft had a light bounce. After touching down for the second time following the bounce, it reached the terminal safely. During inspection before being released for the next flight, our engineer observed that the B737 had had a tail strike,” said an official. Air India Express flight with 190 on board suffers tail strike while landing, all safeAn AI-Ex spokesman said: “There was a tail strike on landing. The aircraft has been checked thoroughly and there was no damage. The plane is now being released to operate a flight to Sharjah.” In the second case, GoAir’s Bengaluru-Ranchi flight had a tail strike during landing at its destination. A GoAir spokesperson said the airline’s flight G8-374 on Sunday “had a minor operational glitch. All the passengers on-board had a safe landing. After inspection, the aircraft has been put back into service (on Monday).” These twin tail strikes comes after two incidents of aircraft veering off runway and taxiway on Sunday.

" Cross-border infiltration in J&amp;K down 43%, govt tells Lok Sabha | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Cross-border infiltration into Jammu & Kashmir fell by 43% in the first half of 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, while terrorist incidents in the state declined by 28% and local recruitment of terrorists by 40% in the corresponding period, the government told Lok Sabha on Tuesday. Minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy, responding to a question on whether infiltration in J&K had declined in the wake of the ‘surgical strike’ (a reference to the Balakot strikes undertaken in February), informed the House, “Due to concerted and synergised efforts of security forces, the security situation in the state has witnessed an improvement in the first half of this year over the corresponding period of 2018. Net infiltration has reduced by 43%.” While Reddy refrained from linking the reduced infiltration to the Balakot strikes, inputs with intelligence agencies suggest that Pakistan-based terrorist outfits have, post the air strikes, got their fighters to abandon launchpads in PoK and instead shift to the western border with Afghanistan. This is the stretch where the United States forces have deployed drones to detect and eliminate terrorists. Incidentally, a report submitted last month by the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Committee to the sanctions committee had quoted Afghan officials as saying that over 20 regional and international terrorist groups were fighting against US-led forces in Afghanistan, mainly in the border areas. Of the 8,000-10,000 foreign fighters estimated to be present in Afghanistan, approximately 500 are Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists, mostly active in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces. Reddy informed Lok Sabha that neutralisation of terrorists in J&K had increased by 22% even as terrorist-initiated attacks fell 28% and local recruitment declined by 40%. On the status of fencing along the India-Pakistan border, the minister said the government had sanctioned fencing of 2,069 km, out of which 2,005 km had been completed and work on the remaining 64 km would be completed by March 2020.

Two Palestinians killed in new Israeli strike: Gaza ministry - Times of India,"JERUSALEM/GAZA: Two Palestinians were killed in new Israeli air and missile strikes on Gaza early Wednesday, the territory's health ministry said, taking the death toll from a two-day flare-up to 12. As dawn broke, air raid sirens sent Israelis rushing to shelters in towns near the Gaza border and deeper in the country. The Israeli military said its forces targeted a Gaza crew preparing to launch rockets over the border. At least one man was killed. The Islamic Jihad militant faction identified him as a member of the group. The worst fighting in months began on Tuesday, after Israel killed in Gaza a top commander of the Iran-backed Islamic Jihad, accusing him of masterminding recent attacks against Israel and planning more in the near future. Gaza's health ministry said, the death toll from the two-day flare-up has gone up to 12. In response, Islamic Jihad gunmen fired about 200 rockets into Israel throughout the day. Further Israeli air strikes on the group's targets in Gaza killed eight Palestinians, seven of them militants, according to Palestinian sources.

Addressing an election rally here, Modi attacked the ruling Congress-JDS combine in Karnataka saying when the whole world stood with India in the aftermath of the airstrikes, the two parties were in tears. Greeting first time voters across the country, he asked them to vote after thinking, to bring a strong government in the country.

""The chief minister (H D Kumarawamy) here went a step ahead and said the bravery of Indian soldiers should not be spoken, because it will affect their vote bank.... ""I want to ask the chief minister whether his vote bankis in India or in Pakistan? Chief minister should clarify on this,"" Modi said. He said the opposition also made fun of India's A-SAT (anti-satellite test) ""Mission Shakti"" on March 27 that put the country as a space power on par with the United States, Russia and China. ""They also made fun of strike in the space, like they did with ( Balakot) air strike. Whole world agreed that India has made an achievement relating to space, but in their habit of opposing Modi, they are opposing India,"" he said. The Prime Minister said these people while in power did not have the 'courage' of permitting scientists to conduct missile tests. But now when India conducted space strike, they were the first in raising questions on it, he added. ""These people don't respect jawans, nor science. Those who don't care about India's pride, it is necessary to teach them a lesson,"" he said. Modi piched for electing a ""strong"" government at the Centre and not a ""mahamilavat (highly adulterated)"" dispensation whose remote control would be in the hands of a dozen people. He lashed out at the Congress-JDS government in Karnataka charging it with having come together for the sake of 'power' and to serve self-interests. The Prime Minister said the same would be replicated if the ""Mahamilavat"" came to power, deriding the anti-BJP ""grand alliance"" of opposition parties. Modi said nobody knew who was running the government in Karnataka, apparently projecting the frequent frictions between the two coalition partners which is also getting reflected in the Lok Sabha polls despite an electoral pact. ""Their complete effort is towards installing a similar Mahamilavati sarkar in Delhi, and its remote control is in the hands of a dozen people. Do you want such a government or a strong government?"" the Prime Minister asked the crowd. The country should have a Prime Minister whose high command was only 130 crore people of the country, he said. Hitting out at the Congress JD(S) for not fulfilling loan waiver promise, he alleged leave alone waiver they were issuing arrest warrant to farmers. ""Whether it is farmer or war, Congress JD(S) does not want to do good to anybody, as their intention itself is not good,"" Modi said. He claimed injustice had been done the country during decades of Congress rule which ""every Indian should remember always."" In the last five years, the BJP led NDA government has put in efforts to ""reduce this injustice Now the time has come to give justice to country that was affected by Congress rule should those who did injustice for 60 years be punished or not?, he asked. ""It is certain that justice will be done to those who were involved in Bofors scam, in National Herald scam, those involved inSikh riots, also those involved in Commonwealth scam, 2G, Coal, loan waiver scam,"" he said, apparently attacking the Congress. Those who made billions of rupees of corruption for their families through these scams will certainly be brought to justice. ""Also to those involved in helicopter scam. Jail doors are waiting,"" he said.

"F16 news: Have 'irrefutable evidence' that our MiG-21 shot down Pakistani F-16, says IAF | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Monday said it has ""irrefutable evidence"" of not only the fact that the F-16 was used by Pakistan Air Force (PAF) on February 27, 2019, but also that the IAF MiG-21 Bison shot down the F-16. Addressing a press conference, Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor said that there is no doubt that two aircraft went down in the aerial engagement on February 27, one of which was the Bison of the IAF while the other was F-16 of the PAF, conclusively identified by its electronic signature and radio transcripts. Indian Air Force (IAF) releases AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) radar images. https://t.co/axy2uVObWZ— ANI (@ANI) 1554727118000During the briefing, several slides of graphic captures from airborne warning and control system (AWACS) were shown to the media. He added, ""Have more credible evidence that is clearly indicative of the fact that Pakistan has lost one F-16, however, due to security and confidentiality concerns, we are restricting the information being shared in the public domain."" The IAF had earlier also asserted that it shot down an F-16 fighter jet of Pakistan during the February 27 dogfight, refuting a leading US news magazine report contradicting India's claim. Earlier, issuing a statement after an American magazine reported that a US count of the F-16s with Pakistan has found that none of these jets are missing, the IAF said, ""during the aerial engagement, one MiG 21 Bison of the IAF shot down an F-16 in Nowshera sector."" In its report, the US magazine said two senior US defence officials with direct knowledge of the situation told it that American personnel recently counted Islamabad's F-16s and found none of the planes missing. However, the Pentagon had   refuted these claims   , saying that it was “not aware” of any audit of Pakistan’s F-16 jets. The government has been maintaining that Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman had engaged with one of the Pakistani F-16s and shot it down before his MiG-21 Bison was downed. Varthaman was captured by Pakistan and was released after spending nearly 60 hours in Pakistani custody. The Indian Air Force had on February 28 displayed pieces of an AMRAAM missile, fired by a Pakistani F-16, as evidence to ""conclusively"" prove that Pakistan deployed the US-manufactured fighter jets during an aerial raid targeting Indian military installations in Kashmir.

 Abhinandan sustained rib injury after assault by Pakistani locals | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman sustained a rib injury due to assault by locals after his MiG-21 was shot down across LoC during a dogfight with Pakistani jets. The MRI scan of the IAF pilot also detected injuries in his lower spine which was most likely caused after he ejected from his fighter jet, reported news agency ANI quoting sources. The sources added that no bugs were detected in the scan. Varthaman on Sunday underwent debriefings by security agencies even as his medical check up continued for the second day at a military hospital in the national capital. A number of senior Indian Air Force (IAF) officials also met Varthaman who was brought to Delhi after he returned to India from Pakistan through the Attari-Wagah border late Friday night. Wing Commander Varthaman was debriefed by the security agencies and it will continue for the next couple of days. He also underwent several medical tests as part of a cooling down process, the officials said. ""The efforts have been to ensure that he returns to the cockpit soon,"" a military official said. The IAF pilot was captured by the Pakistani army on Wednesday after his jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during a fierce aerial confrontation. He downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan before his plane was hit. Varthaman arrived in the national capital by an IAF flight at around 11.45pm on Friday, nearly two-and-half hours after he crossed over to India through the Attari-Wagah border. The IAF pilot was first taken to the Air Force Central Medical Establishment (AFCME), a compact and specialised medical evaluation centre for aircrew of all the three services. Later he was brought to the Army's Research and Referral hospital. After he was captured, Varthaman showed courage and grace in handling the most difficult circumstances for which he was praised by politicians, strategic affairs experts, ex-servicemen, celebrities and people in general. Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa met Varthaman separately on Saturday during which he apprised them about the mental trauma he was subjected to during his captivity in Pakistan. During the meeting, the defence minister commended him on his valour and expressed the nation's gratitude for his selfless service. The officials said Varthaman has been in high spirits despite the harassment he suffered in Pakistan. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after Indian fighters bombed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed's biggest training camp near Balakot, deep inside Pakistan early Tuesday. Pakistan retaliated by attempting to target Indian military installations on Wednesday. However, the IAF thwarted their plans. The Indian strike on the JeM camp came 12 days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Kashmir, killing 40 soldiers.

Falcon Slayer: Abhinandan Varthaman’s mates get new patch to mark kill | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s MiG-21 Bison squadron has got new patches made with ‘Falcon Slayers’ and ‘AMRAAM Dodgers’ embossed on them to mark his shooting down of a Pakistani F-16 during the aerial skirmish on February 27, a day after the pre-dawn air strikes on a JeM terror facility in Balakot. The shoulder and chest patches or badges, which are worn on the flying overalls by pilots to showcase achievements of their squadron but are not part of official uniforms, however, have not been approved by higher authorities in the IAF. “The ‘Falcon Slayers’ bit is fine because the MiG-21 being flown by Varthaman (who has now been posted to another airbase in Rajasthan) shot down an F-16 with an R-73 air-to-air missile before his fighter was also downed that day. It was truly creditworthy,” an officer said. “But the ‘AMRAAM Dodgers’ part has not gone down well. It could have been ‘AMRAAM Defeaters’ or something else. The patches will need to be re-worked,” he added. All squadrons have special patches made to commemorate their feats, as also instil pride in the current and future generations of pilots. The No. 22 Squadron of IAF, for instance, got the sobriquet of ‘Sabre Slayers’ after its Gnats shot down Pakistani Sabre fighters during the 1971 war. During the dogfight on February 27, the older Russian-origin MiG-21s from No. 51 Squadron at Srinagar took the battle to the much more advanced Pakistani F-16s, armed with AIM-120C advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles (AMRAAMs), and thwarted their attack. The MiG-21s were backed by Sukhoi-30MKIs. The young, gung-ho MiG-21 pilots are obviously proud. The No. 51 Squadron patch shows a MiG-21 in the foreground, with an F-16 in the cross-hairs in the background. The Sukhoi-30MKI squadron, too, has the sobriquet ‘AMRAAM Dodgers’ in its new patches, which show its fighters successfully evading the AMRAAM missiles fired by the F-16s. “Both squadrons will now need to order re-designed patches,” another officer said.

 Infiltration in J&amp;K down after Balakot strike: Govt | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Security situation in Jammu and Kashmir has witnessed an improvement and the net infiltration from across the border has reduced by 43 per cent after a surgical strike was carried out on terror camps in Pakistan, Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai said in Lok Sabha on Tuesday. Rai's remarks came in response to a written question on whether cross-border infiltration in Jammu and Kashmir has abated after the Air Force carried out surgical strike on terror camps in Balakot in Pakistan in February this year. ""Due to concerted and synergised efforts of security forces, the security situation in the state has witnessed an improvement in the first half of this year over the corresponding period of 2018. Net infiltration has reduced by 43 per cent,"" he said. 'Operation Bandar' was IAF's code name for Balakot strikeslivebudget updatesmoreupdatesThe minister said the Central government has adopted a policy of zero tolerance towards cross-border infiltration. Rai said the government of India in tandem with the state government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to contain cross-border infiltration, which include multi-tiered deployment along the International Border and the Line of Control (LoC), border fencing, improved intelligence and operational coordination, equipping security forces with improved technological weapons and taking pro-active action against infiltrators. Replying another question, the minister said the electric fence namely the Anti Infiltration Obstacle System (AIOS) on LoC along India-Pak border has proved to be a potent tool to guard against infiltration. The electricity requirements for the AIOS are being catered through power grid wherever available and through generators at other locations to ensure uninterrupted power supply, he said.

"Days after Imran visit, US resumes Pakistan aid - Times of India","WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: The US is reopening the military aid spigot to Pakistan within a week of Prime Minister Imran Khan meeting President Donald Trump, with the Pentagon notifying its decision to approve $125 million worth of technical and logistics support for Pakistani F-16 fighter jets. The aid resumption, made at the ""request"" of Pakistan, was disclosed by a Pentagon notification to the US Congress on Friday. The notification, however, said the proposed foreign military sale would provide ""24/7 end-use monitoring"" of the F-16s, with 60 US contractor representatives being stationed in Pakistan to assist in the oversight of the programme. The Pentagon simultaneously notified the US Congress about the proposed $670 million follow-on support programme for the 11 C-17 Globemaster-III strategic air-lift aircraft of the Indian Air Force, in what was interpreted in New Delhi as ""not a mere coincidence"" and ""re-hyphenisation of India and Pakistan"". US officials emphasised that the restoration of the F-16 support programme does not mean the Trump administration is resuming military aid to Pakistan and there is no change to the security assistance suspension announced by the President in January, 2018. But American mandarins have said Imran Khan's visit was aimed primarily at ""incentivising"" Pakistan to help the US troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Trump himself stated he was ready to restore the $1.3 billion annual aid the previous Obama administration had lined up for Pakistan - and which Trump suspended - if Pakistan did the right things. India is apprehensive that Pakistan will yet again play the Americans for s*****s, as it has done so often in the past, given that Washington has a notoriously short memory and a fickle foreign policy outlook that is all the more capricious under a President who marches to his own drumbeat. India, of course, would have preferred the total freeze to continue. ""But our concerns would be somewhat addressed if the proposed sale indeed leads to greater end-use monitoring of Pakistan's F-16s. Remember Pakistan also deployed F-16s in their intended retaliatory strike on Indian military installations on February 27, a day after IAF jets bombed the JeM facility at Balakot,"" said a senior Indian official. Pakistan currently operates 75 of the F-16s, which were acquired in batches under the pretext of the global fight against terrorism, and later upgraded with advanced radars, targeting systems, fire-and-forget missiles and precision-guided munitions. ""Some would also have been configured to deliver nuclear weapons,"" said another Indian official. By some accounts, the US has given Pakistan nearly $80 billion (adjusted for current value of dollar) in aid since the country was carved out of united India in 1947. The assistance, particularly military aid, has increased manifold whenever the US finds itself in a sticky position in the region - often caused by Pakistan's policies -as it did during 9/11 when Pakistan-sponsored Taliban sheltered Osama bin Laden and the perpetrators of the biggest terror attack on America. India worries that Washington is repeating the same mistakes, including restoring Pakistan's primacy over Afghanistan that allowed it to become a stomping ground for terrorists. Moreover, both Pakistan and North Korea were partners who helped each other in nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology under China's benign tutelage, which has already been forgotten in the current bromance between President Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. The missiles North Korea tested last week were described in the US media as ""projectiles"" even as Trump played down the provocation. ""They're short-range missiles and my relationship is very good with Chairman Kim, and we'll see what happens,"" Trump told reporters, adding, ""They're short range missiles, and many people have those missiles.""

 Opposition asking for operational details of Balakot strike untenable: Javadekar | India News - Times of India,"KOLKATA: Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday criticised opposition parties for questioning the Indian Air Force's bombing of a terror training camp in Pakistan, saying operational details cannot be shared as doing so will only help that country. He said seeking proof of the operation in Balakot amounted to showing lack of confidence in the armed forces. ""The whole country is proud of our armed forces ... the Air Force. When they have conducted air strikes deep inside Pakistan, raising doubt and asking for proof is actually helping Pakistan. Asking for proof amounts to not showing confidence in our Army and Air Force,"" he told PTI. Javadekar's comments came in the backdrop of growing chorus by opposition parties, especially Congress leaders, for showing evidence of the pre-emptive strike on Jaish-e-Muhammed training camp by the Indian Air Force on February 26. Javadekar is in West Bengal's Burdwan district to attend a meeting. When asked about the demand by some opposition leaders that the government release evidence of the air strike, the human resource development minister said,""There are operational details which are never shared beacuse that will directly help Pakistan. ""There is a minmum decorum and it (the strike) should not be politicised the way opposition parties are politicising (it)."" ""The whole country stands united with our armed forces and Air Force. It is absolutely untenable that you ask about the details. Which plane? How they did it? Which bombs were used? You are asking for operational details which is untenable and no country does this, he said. Several senior Congress leaders including Digvijaya Singh and Kapil Sibal have sought proof of Indian Air Force's strike that was believed to have destroyed the biggest camp of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Pakistan. ""Modi ji must answer as the international media like New York Times, Washington Post, London-based Jane Information group, Daily Telegraph, the Guardian and Reuters, are reporting that there is no proof of militant losses at Balakot in Pakistan,"" Sibal said. ""You are guilty of politicising terror,"" Sibal said on Twitter. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clear the doubt as one of his ministers had denied TV news that 300 terrorists were killed in the air strike on February 26. ""Modi ji, Your central minister is denying TV news that prime minister Modi has never confirmed the killing of 300 terrorists in IAF air strikes in Pakistan.Is it true. If not, the prime minister should tell the truth to the country (sic),"" he said on Twitter. Surjewala also put out a news report about Union minister SS Ahluwalia's comments. Punjab minister and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu said, ""300 terrorist dead, Yes or No? What was the purpose then? Were you uprooting terrorist or trees? Was it an election gimmick? Deceit possesses our land in guise of fighting a foreign enemy. Stop politicising the Army, it is as sacred as the State,"" he said, adding ""Oonchi Dukaan, Pheeka Pakwan"" (big talk, no delivery). Refuting allegations that BJP was trying to gain political mileage from the air assault ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, Javadekar said his party never uses the bravery of jawans to serve its political purposes. For the BJP, he said, national security is above politics. ""We BJP never use the bravery of jawans for political purpose. The fact of the matter is even after 26/11 (Mumbai terror attacks 2008) the Army had shown willingness to act but it was not permitted (by the then UPA government). The present government permitted (the attack),"" he said. Javadekar recollected how the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had allowed nuclear tests at Pokhran in 1998 after four previous prime ministers did not take a call and sign the order on the file.

" Government, opposition continue to trade barbs over Balakot strikes | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The war of words over the Balakot strikes in Pakistan continued on Wednesday with the government slamming the opposition for rallying behind ""terror-exporting Pakistan"" and the latter questioning the Centre over the outcome of the military action. Accusing Narendra Modi of doing opportunistic politics over the dead bodies of jawans, West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee today said that the Prime Minister is trying to paint himself as the lone patriot. ""As you (Modi) have done nothing in the last five years, that is why you need to show missiles, bombs and dead bodies of jawans. Don't you feel ashamed that you are doing opportunistic politics over the dead bodies of jawans? We all stand by our armed forces, for our country, but we are not with the Modi regime,"" Banerjee said while addressing a program in Howrah district. ""Those who are questioning the government over the outcome of the airstrikes on Jaish training camps in Balakot are branded as 'Pakistanis' as if we all belong to the neighbouring country and only he (Modi) is an Indian,"" she said. In its counter offensive, the BJP said it was a travesty that opposition parties are ""rallying behind the terror-exporting Pakistan"" when the whole world is backing India. In a dig at the Congress and its ""allies"", BJP spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao said that seeing the ""cries and the critical comments"" of the Congress and its political friends, one is left wondering if they have been hit by the strike that ""killed an unprecedentedly large number of terrorists"" in Pakistan's territory. He said in a statement that ""irresponsible"" comments by various Congress party leaders over India's air strike on terror bases in Pakistan show their desperation and frustration at the unprecedented success of the Indian armed forces and their valour. The Congress and its friends are being increasingly seen as ""cheerleaders"" for Pakistan, he alleged. Earlier today, National Conference (NC) leader Farooq Abdullah had asked BJP president Amit Shah to substantiate with proof his claim that over 250 terrorists were killed in the IAF strikes. ""Where is the proof when Amit Shah says 300 died? Where is the proof of those 300? And (when) you ask, you are anti-national, you are against the country (sic),"" said Farooq. Meanwhile, Union home minister Rajnath Singh slammed those questioning the air strikes and asked if it was the duty of pilots to land and count the number of casualties after hitting the given targets. Praising the IAF for carrying out the attack, Rajnath said: ""The way the IAF attacked the terror camps set up in our neighbouring country is absolutely remarkable. But there are a few people who are questioning it, I want to ask them: Was it the duty of pilots to land and then count the numbers to know how many were killed after hitting the given targets?"" ""The IAF pilots didn't shower flowers, they hit terror camps. If no casualty took place then why did Pakistan get scared and send their jets into our territory?"" he asked. The BJP and opposition parties have been involved in a bitter war of words with the latter asking the government to show proof of the high number of casualties in the air strikes, as claimed by many ruling party leaders. The ruling party has hit back at the opposition parties, saying its rivals were lowering the morale of armed forces. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
" At IAF commanders meet, defence minister praises 'flawless execution' of Balakot operation | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday complimented the Indian Air Force for its ""flawless execution"" of the February 26 Balakot operation and subsequent thwarting of the Pakistani response as she addressed top IAF commanders here. Sitharaman, in her inaugural speech at the two-day IAF conference, also commended Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who had become the face of the conflict between the two nations. Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal B S Dhanoa emphasised on further enhancing the IAF's capability in the field of space, cyber, artificial intelligence and drone technology to further boost its overall combat capability. The IAF said the commanders will deliberate on a range of issues including the ""successful strike over Balakot"" and the subsequent Pakistani air action on February 27, besides exploring ways to enhance India's air power capability in the short and long term. ""The defence minister complimented the IAF and its air warriors for achieving and maintaining the highest standards of professionalism in the service of the nation. She praised the IAF for its flawless execution of the Balakot strikes and subsequent thwarting of the Pakistani response,"" the IAF said. On February 26, India carried out an aerial strike on a terrorist training camp of the Jaish-e Mohammad terror group in Pakistan's Balakot, in response to Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. Pakistan Air Force retaliated the next day by trying to target military installations but it was repulsed. The PAF downed a MiG-21 Bison in an aerial combat besides capturing IAF pilot Varthaman, who was handed over to India on March 1. Varthaman had shot down an F-16 of Pakistan before his Mig21 Bison was hit. Sitharaman said the IAF has proved its mettle during last year's exercise Gagan Shakti and Vayu Shakti drills in February and the same was reflected in the successfully conducted of the Balakot strike and the air action on February 27, IAF said in a statement. ""She expressed great appreciation for the training imparted to all personnel in the IAF as reflected in the actions and conduct of Wing Commander Abhinandan,"" it added. Sitharaman stressed on a proactive role of the IAF in the Indian Ocean Region and called for enhancing defence cooperation with countries of the region. She also asked the force to look at bringing latest technologies available across the world and those that can be developed within India, in order to meet its needs. ""She added that she is aware of the critical requirements projected by the IAF and assured that as a nation we need to build those capabilities,"" the IAF said. Sitharaman said the IAF will play a vital role in enhancing the defence manufacturing capabilities of India through its acquisitions under the strategic partnership model. The government unveiled the strategic partnership model in May 2017 under which select private firms were to be roped in to build key military platforms like submarines and fighter jets in India in partnership with global defence majors. ""During the two-day conference, discussions and deliberations will take place in line with the theme of the conference of 'enhancing our operational capability in the short and long term',"" the IAF said.

Addressing a press conference, the Air Chief Marshal said the target has been clearly amplified by the foreign secretary in his statement. ""If we plan to hit the target, we hit the target, otherwise why would he   (Pakistan PM) have responded   , if we dropped bombs in the jungles why would he respond,"" he asked. He added the Indian Air Force (IAF) is not in a position to clarify the number of casualties. ""The government will clarify that. We don't count human casualties,"" he said.

""One is a planned operation in which you plan and carry out an operation. But when an adversary does a strike on you, every available aircraft goes in, irrespective of which aircraft it is. All aircraft are capable of fighting the enemy,"" he added. On being asked if Wing Commander   Abhinandan flies again or not   , he said, ""Whether he flies or not depends on his medical fitness.

 Go all out to explain to world reasons behind air strike inside Pakistan: Parliamentary panel to foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel on Friday asked the government to go all out to explain to the international community reasons behind India's decision to carry out air strike on Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) terror camp inside Pakistan. The suggestion came when foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed the Parliamentary Standing Committee on external affairs about the latest developments that have taken place between India and Pakistan after the February 14 Pulwama terror attack by JeM in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed . Gokhale, who was assisted by officials of the ministry of external affairs, informed the members about the air strikes on JeM terror camps in Pakistan as also about the retaliation by the western neighbour, source said. He told the panel that the attempt by Pakistan Air Force to target military installations in India was unsuccessful as it was thwarted by the IAF which lost a jet in the fight back. The members told the foreign secretary that the government should vigorously publicise across the world the reasons behind New Delhi's move to target the terror camps, a member later said. Congress president Rahul Gandhi is a member of the committee but was not present in the meeting on Friday. Gokhale answered queries about the assessment of damage caused by the air strike. But he explained that the defence ministry was better equipped to answer this. The foreign secretary also informed the members on how India got the support of the members of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on the issue where external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj is a guest of honour. Pakistan has boycotted the plenary session of OIC meet to protest India's participation there. The panel members also lauded the armed forces, including the IAF and described the air strike as a ""glorious and heroic"" job which needs to be widely publicised. Earlier, Gokhale shared in detail the sequence of events of the last few days till the capture of the Indian pilot. The purpose of the meeting, described as good and constructive, was part of ""parliamentary accountability"" and the ministry gave a briefing in this regard, a member said. The committee is headed by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor. The briefing was on Indo-Pak relations in the light of the strain in relationship after the Pulwama attack and an air strike by India. Tensions between the two countries escalated after Indian fighters bombed terror group Jaish-e-Muhammed's biggest training camp near Balakot deep inside Pakistan early Tuesday. It came 12 days after the JeM claimed responsibility for the suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Kashmir. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
No Pakistan soldier died in Balakot: Sushma Swaraj - Times of India,"External affairs minister and BJP leader Sushma Swaraj on Thursday said no Pakistani soldier or citizen died in the air strike carried out by the Indian Air Force across the border in response to the Pulwama terror attack in February. Addressing women party workers in Ahmedabad, she stressed on a 2014-like full majority for the BJP-led government this time also, saying former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee could not do everything that he wanted to because he was heading a coalition administration. The IAF had struck a Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot area on February 26, in response to the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. Swaraj said the air strike was carried out in selfdefence. “When we carried out the air strike across the border, after the Pulwama terror attack, we had told the international community that we took that step in self-defence only. “We had told the international community that the armed forces were instructed not to harm any Pakistani citizen or its soldier during the strike,” she said.

 Opposition scored self-goal by questioning success of Balakot air strike: Arun Jaitley | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The opposition has scored a self-goal by asking for proof of damage following air strike on Balakot terror camp, finance minister Arun Jaitley said Saturday. The air strike and surgical strike carried out by the armed forces should not be part of Lok Sabha election campaign, he said at an India TV event here. ""I fully agree with the Election Commission that images of martyrs should not be used on political posters,"" he said. Citing example of 1971 war, he said, the entire opposition stood by the ruling dispensation, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of Jan Sangh, defended the government on every forum. However, the finance minister said, some of the opposition members accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of politicising the Pulwama and Balakot incidents. Statements made by 21 opposition parties hurt India's national interest and gave handle to Pakistan to discredit the country, he added. ""Raising question on the action of armed forces with the view to creating doubts in the mind of countrymen was self-goal or shot themselves in the foot by doing this,"" Jaitley noted. In contrast to this, he said, when the US attacked Osama bin Laden, no one raised any question on the operation conducted by their armed forces and demanded the proof. Asked about BJP leader B S Yeddyurappa's attempt to politicise the action taken by the armed forces, Jaitley said, it was wrong on his part to do so and the party has condemned it. The valour of armed forces should not be made a political issue, he said, adding the armed forces have to be kept at arm's length from domestic politics. On the government's message to Pakistan, the finance minister said, ""if you promote terrorism, you have to pay such a heavy price that you will find terrorism unaffordable...the trend has been set now"". Taking a dig at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, he said some people either need to learn more and if they don't do that they must realise that they are unfit for public discourse.

"Narendra Modi: Surgical strikes to Article 370, Modi govt rewrites stale India-Pak script | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: For long, India's response to a major terror strike inspired and backed by Pakistan was largely to suspend dialogue and launch a diplomatic offensive. At the other end of the scale was the threat, rarely invoked, to use military might as after the attack on Parliament in 2001. The 2001-02 military standoff lasted months and ended with a ceasefire agreement and later a joint statement where Pakistan pledged not to let its territory be used for terror against India. Though Pakistan has breached the pledge often, the muscle flexing did force some concessions from Pakistan's then ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf. But massive military mobilisation is cumbersome and expensive and cannot be frequently repeated. Soon, Pakistan got back to its routine - waiting for the storm to blow over and international pressure to build on ""nuclear armed"" neighbours to resume talks. India's reluctance to use force after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks reinforced this belief in Pakistan's elite circles.  India was left oscillating between an ineffective suspension of a stuttering dialogue and threat of war. There did not seem any effective measures between these opposing points on a strategic scale.  The situation changed with the Modi government resorting to the 2016 surgical strikes which brought home to the military brass in Rawalpindi that infiltrating terrorists into Jammu & Kashmir will not be without costs. Pakistan denied the strikes occurred, but local reports, including an audio sting of the local police head, made it clear that many jihadis waiting on launch pads had died. The 2019 Pulwama attack led to the Balakot strike and while Islamabad again denied the Jaish-e-Mohammed camp was hit, prolonged closure of its air space indicated that the possibility of IAF striking targets deep in Pakistan had induced a worrying sense of uncertainty. Pakistan won't start war or use nukes first against India, says Imran Though Indian planners may not have specifically considered it, the Modi government's actions seem to draw a leaf from the ""compellence doctrine"" articulated by Nobel winning economist Thomas Schelling which outlines actions to proactively change status quo instead of the more passive deterrence.  Innovative diplomacy in West Asia with Saudia Arabia and the UAE drawn into closer ties are other, more conventional, aspects of Indian policy to contain Pakistan whose leaders lament the indifference of Muslim states to developments in J&K. The decision to turn Article 370 into a dead letter is the Modi government's boldest and most significant step and one that Pakistan cannot ignore. It now finds itself in the unusual situation of scrambling to react - a change from the past when it brazened it out. Govt to tell Kashmiris about benefits of Article 370 movePakistan has, apart from a major campaign on ""human rights"" in J&K, raised the nuclear scenario to gain global attention. This has been a familiar recipe too though the incongruity of raising the spectre of atomic weapons in response to alleged human rights violations might escape Pakistani PM Imran Khan.  While India has not changed its nuclear no first use posture, a stance that marks it as a responsible nation, defence minister Rajnath Singh's suggestion that NFU is not cast in stone gives Pakistan's military more to chew on. It is another inflexion point in a battle of nerves. From hints that NFU is not sacrosanct to plans to use Indus waters (without breaching the water sharing treaty) are intended to make Pakistan bear the consequences of its rogue actions. It's a new experience. In Video:Modi government rewrites stale India-Pakistan scriptDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 IAF can carry out bombings in all-weather conditions: Dhanoa | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The IAF is prepared to fight across the entire spectrum of warfare, be it punitive retaliation to a terrorist attack, a skirmish like the Kargil conflict or an all-out war, said Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa on Tuesday . Speaking at a function to mark the 20th anniversary of the Kargil conflict with Pakistan, the IAF chief said his force now has the capability to carry out precision bombings.  ""In case required, we can do all-weather bombing even through clouds very accurately. We have seen an attack carried out on February 26 (Balakot airstrike) that shows we are capable of carrying out precision strikes from stand-off distances very accurately,"" said ACM Dhanoa.  This precision-bombing capability was limited only to the Mirage-2000 fighters during the Kargil conflict. Now, it is also available on Sukhoi-30MKIs, Jaguars, MiG-29s and MiG-27s, with IAF having the capability to conduct bombing from long distances in all-weather conditions. The IAF has also enhanced its reach and endurance through air-to-air refuelling aircraft, fire-and-forget beyond visual range missiles and eyes in the sky in the shape of AWACS .

 Venkaiah Naidu likens Pak's position post-air strikes to thief stung by scorpion | India News - Times of India,"COIMBATORE: Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu Thursday slammed Pakistan for ""funding and training"" terrorists and likened its position after the recent air strikes to a thief stung by a scorpion. In his address at the graduation ceremony of a private college here, he also hailed Indian forces for their recent air strikes on terror camps in Pakistan. ""The situation of our neighbouring country is such that they cant accept it and also cant keep quiet about it,"" he said quoting a Telugu adage on a thief stung by a scorpion. ""That is the situation of Pakistan today. They have been funding and training terrorists, he said at the event in PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research. Everyone witnessed how the defence forces fought for the cause of unity and integrity of the nation, ""how skillfully they did their duty in recent strikes,"" he said referring to the February 26 air strikes on terror camps in Balakot in Pakistan. Talking about farmers' plight, he said agriculture sector should get the same importance as technology and research instead of sops like loan waivers. ""It's time for introducing structural changes in agriculture rather than giving loan waivers to farmers,"" he said. Noting that 54 per cent of Indian population was living in rural areas and depended on agriculture, he said sops such as loan waiver and free power for farmers will not work. ""We need assured power for farmers. I interact with farmers and pass the feedback I receive to the Prime Minister and chief ministers and policy making bodies such as Niti Aayog, the vice-president said. Naidu wanted to make it mandatory for students to visit and spend time in villages so that they understand the lives of farmers. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
"India has carried out three counter strikes, not two, in five years: Rajnath Singh | Mangaluru News - Times of India","MANGALURU: Union home minister Rajnath Singh told a BJP convention in Mangaluru on Saturday that “India has carried out three counter strikes, not two, in the last five years.” Addressing Shakti Kendra Pramukhs of the BJP, Singh said, “People know about the surgical strike of Uri and the air strike IAF carried out in Balakot. But we have carried out three counter strikes in five years. I can give you details of the two counter-terror operations. However, I can’t disclose details of the third one.” Singh warned Pakistan it’ll have to pay a heavy price for promoting terrorism by providing shelter to terrorists. “India will not provoke Pakistan, but we will not tolerate provocation from their side,” he said. On Balakot air strike, the minister said, “We successfully destroyed the terror camp in Pakistan.” “It was a targeted mission carried out successfully by the IAF with specific intelligence inputs. Our brave soldiers carried out the attack and sent a strong message to Pakistan. The opposition, which is seeking proof, seems to have lost faith in Indian forces. The IAF team had gone there with a mission with specific intelligence inputs. Our MiG-21 destroyed their F-16. It’s a question of our country’s pride,” he said. He added that by 2028, India will be one of the three powerful countries in the world. “India has become the fastest-growing nation in the world. In 2014, the economy was in the ninth position among the 10 powerful nations in the world. At present, India is in the sixth place and is heading to the fifth position. The world considers the US, Russia and China the three most powerful nations. Very soon, we’ll become one among the three powerful nations in the world,” Singh said. Paying tributes to soldiers martyred in the Pulwama attack, especially CRPF jawan H Guru from Mandya, Singh said people of Karnataka have contributed immensely to the nation. ‘Khichdi govt in Karnataka’Ridiculing the coalition government, Rajnath Singh said, “Karnataka has a khichdi government where the welfare of people is not possible.” “The JD(S) is busy protecting its chair. The BJP is not politicking to secure power, but to make India strong and a superpower. Some say we’re discriminating in the name of religion. Our policy is nothing but justice for all – Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.” Singh said the central government has implemented several schemes for Karnataka, especially for the coastal belt. He also said the demand for a separate railway division for Mangaluru will be considered seriously. “We have taken up several measures to ensure safety and security of coastal Karnataka,” he added. On Lok Sabha elections, Singh said while victory for BJP in three coastal Lok Sabha constituencies – Dakshina Kannada, Udupi-Chikkamagaluru and Uttara Kannada — is sure, the party aims at bagging all the 28 seats in the state.

 How the political discourse has changed in 100 days | India News - Times of India,"(This story originally appeared in  on Mar 12, 2019)(This article was originally published by The Economic Times on 12/03/2019.) The 100 days before Lok Sabha elections were announced on March 10 have been very eventful. From reservation to economically weaker sections to war clouds, the political narrative kept changing. ET takes a look at the major events that could impact the polls: Farmer is King Congress waived farm loans soon after it formed government in MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. In December, West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand announced direct cash transfers for farmers, ranging from Rs 5,000 per acre to Rs 10,000 per family per year. It forced the Centre to rethink and come up with a PM Kisan scheme in the Budget to provide Rs 6,000 per year to every farmer who has up to five acres. Reservations For All The SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act became an election issue in MP and Rajasthan. To contain BJP’s losses, the NDA government introduced 10 per cent reservation for economically backward class with annual income up to Rs 8 lakh. Rajasthan introduced a bill for 5 per cent reservation to Gurjars and four other communities above existing OBC quota on February 13. Andhra implemented EWS reservation with 5-10 per cent quota to Kapus who make 27 per cent of the state population. MP issued an ordinance to raise state OBC quota to 27 per cent from 14 per cent on March 6. The Centre overturned a court verdict to restore 200-point roaster system for faculty reservation in universities on February 28. CBI Crisis The Supreme Court restored Alok Verma as CBI director on January 8 overruling the Modi government’s decision to bench him. On January 11, Verma quit after he was shunted out from CBI. Before this, the CBI extradited Christian Michel from Dubai on December 6 in the Agusta Westland case. In another case on February 3, the CBI team which reached the residence of Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar to examine him in the Saradha chit fund case was detained by the Kolkata police leading to a government-opposition show down. Mandir Mediation BJP raised the Mandir pitch during the last round of assembly elections and several party leaders demanded an Ordinance for construction of a Ram Temple. Hearing on the Ayodhya title dispute continued in the apex court and on February 1, the Vishva Hindu Parishad put off the demand on Ram Temple till Lok Sabha elections concluded. The decision was endorsed by the RSS. On March 8, SC ordered formation of a mediation panel to look for an out of court solution. Fight Over Rafale On December 14, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea to probe the Rafale jets deal. On February 13, CAG tabled its audit report which claimed that the NDA deal was 2.86 per cent cheaper. However the CAG also said that the deal could have been even cheaper as banking guarantees were waived. It gave some ammunition to the opposition but the Balakot air strike saw erasure of the discourse. Prime Minister Modi said that Rafale could have made a difference in India’s air capability. Publication of Rafale documents in The Hindu led to fresh controversy on March 4, with the AG claiming that it was stolen documents. He later denied that the documents were not stolen. Pulwama and Balakot The terror attack on CRPF convoy on February 14 in Pulwama was followed by February 26 bombing of Jaish-e-Mohammad camp in Balakot by the Indian Air Force. Pakistan fighter jets entered Indian border the next day, resulting in a dog fight. In the process, Pakistan captured Wing Commander Abhinandan but released him on March 1. Pulwama and Balakot gave fresh political momentum for the ruling BJP, while the opposition got together to redraw strategies. Priyanka’s Debut On January 23, Priyanka Gandhi joined active politics and was made general secretary in-charge of East UP. On February 11, she went on a road show in Lucknow with her brother, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, and held meetings of party workers from East UP. There has been no word about her activities post-Balakot. Her joining politics coincided with legal teams of the Enforcement Directorate examining her husband Robert Vadra. Alliances and Poll PactsNDA: RLSP quit NDA on December 10 and joined the opposition grand alliance in Bihar. BJP quickly finalized seat sharing with JDU on December 23. On February 18, BJP sealed an alliance with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and a day later it sealed an alliance with AIADMK and PMK in Tamil Nadu. SP and BSP announced alliance on January 12 leaving two seats for RLD. RLD and SP announced alliance on March 5 to contest three seats. SP left one seat for RLD. Opposition: Despite several meetings, the Opposition, especially Congress, has not been able to announce its alliances. On February 13, opposition leaders met at Sharad Pawar residence and decided to have prepoll alliance and a common minimum programme. The strategy was hit after the Pulwama attack the very next day. Congress partners in Bihar, Karnataka and Maharashtra want more seats and the party is yet to concede space to smaller parties. Congress has only announced an alliance in TN and with Mahan Dal in UP. The party has announced it was not tying up with AAP in Delhi, on March 11, after much back and forth. In Bihar, RJD has given a March 13 ultimatum to Congress to resolve its issues. Congress’ Income GuaranteeWhile addressing a rally on January 28 in Raipur, Congress president Rahul Gandhi announced that if Congress returns to power, the party would implement a scheme that would ensure minimum income for every poor family of the country. The scheme was being planned as part of Congress manifesto. Anticipating a similar announcement in the budget, Gandhi unveiled Congress’ plan for an early lead. Tax ReliefThe NDA government introduced income-tax waiver for employees earning up to Rs 5 lakh per annum in the interim budget. Ordinances RuleOn February 28, the Union Cabinet cleared five ordinances. Apart from law to restore faculty reservation in universities, another ordinance was to amend the Aadhaar Act, allowing individuals to voluntarily use it for identification. On February 19, ordinance for banning instant triple talaq was repromulgated. The bill passed twice by the Lok Sabha has been stuck in the RS. Another ordinance was to ban unregulated deposit schemes to curb ponzi schemes. There was a speculation the Centre may promulgate an ordinance for amending the Citizenship Act but following severe opposition from parties in the northeast, it was not considered.

Abhinandan Varthaman:   Balakot airstrike could have killed 250 to 300 terrorists: Abhinandan's father | India News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Air Marshal (retired) Simhakutty Vardhaman, father of wing commander Abhinandan who was briefly in Pakistan custody, says the laser-guided smart bombs (SPICE - 2000) used to attack the terror camp at Balakot could have killed 250 to 300 terrorists. Talking to students of defence studies at IIT-Madras on Wednesday about the air strikes on the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror training camp at Balakot in Pakistan, he said, ""The Indian Air Force strike happened when the maximum targets were inside the camp. The structural damage might be limited, but the fuse of the bomb is delayed to ensure maximum casualties."" Varthamans a MiG-21 family: Son flies it, dad flew it""Pakistan’s F-16s and AMRAAM missiles were the real threat to us. We had to first get F-16s off our back by making sure they were headed to some other direction when we were going to Balakot. So we did a lot of deception,"" he said. ""Basically, we launched seven aircraft towards Bahawalpur, which is the headquarters of JeM. Pakistan thought we were on the way to attack Bahawalpur and sent F-16s to engage with our fighter aircraft. Simultaneously, we launched aircraft to attack Balakot. In a nutshell, the Pakistan Air Force was deceived completely,"" he explained. ""Pakistan was in a total state of alert, they knew an attack from India was imminent. However, they did not realise that we got into their territory,"" he added. The decorated air marshal, however, added that this was his reading of the events, which may not be the absolute truth. ""The exact details may come out months later,"" he said. The Balakot operation was the   first time IAF aircraft had crossed the border since the 1971 war   with Pakistan, air marshal Vardhaman said. ""When fighter aircraft fly 10km within the border, radars alert us to turn back. If a pilot goes within 8km of the border, he faces a lot of questions and inquiry,"" he said. ""As a nation, we decided to violate this huge thumb rule and went inside Pakistan. But, the government clearly mentioned that it was a nonmilitary, pre-emptive strike. The selection of the target was also conditioned by our desire to avoid civilian casualties. The facility was located in a thick forest on a hilltop far away from civilian presence,"" he pointed out.

 IAF prepared to fight across entire spectrum of warfare: Air Force chief | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) is ready for any kind of warfare, be it a skirmish like Kargil conflict, a retaliation to a terrorist attack or an all-out war, Air Force chief B S Dhanoa said Tuesday. Addressing a seminar on '20 years of Op Safed Sagar', Dhanoa, who was then the Commanding Officer of 17 Squadron and operating from Srinagar, recalled the air action that took place during the Kargil conflict. It was for the first time that the MiG-21 aircraft carried out the air-to-ground bombing at night in the mountains, he said. Operation Safed Sagar was carried out by the Air Force in Operation Vijay to drive out infiltrators from Kargil. Dhanoa spoke about the operational limitations that existed in 1999 and the innovative ways adopted by the IAF to overcome the difficulties during the conflict. The developments which took place post Kargil war have transformed the Air Force in capability so as to counter any kind of air threat in conventional and sub-conventional domains of warfare, he said. ""The IAF is prepared to fight across the entire spectrum of warfare, be it an all-out war, a skirmish like Kargil conflict or retaliation to a terrorist attack,"" the Air Force Chief said. Early this year, after the Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel, the Air Force launched airstrikes at a terror camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistani territory. During the Kargil conflict, precision bombing capabilities which existed only on Mirage-2000 are now also available on Su-30, Jaguar, MiG-29 and MiG-27 upgraded aircraft, Dhanoa noted. At present, BVR (beyond-visual-range) missiles are carried by MiG-29, Su-30 and Mirage-2000 aircraft. The IAF has the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft to monitor the airspace deep inside the enemy territory and operates on secure communication with network-centric warfare capabilities, he said.

Those seeking proof of aerial strikes should go to the border: Sampla | Ludhiana News - Times of India,"JALANDHAR: Reacting strongly to the demands by opposition leaders to show evidence of casualties in aerial strike at Balakot, Union minister of state Vijay Sampla has said that those who are asking for proof should themselves go to the border and stand with the forces there. “Those who are asking for evidence should first go to the border. They should first stand with the army there. They should not demand proof while sitting in their comfortable confines and should rather send us the evidence (after standing there). It is very easy to seek proofs but very difficult to guard the borders. They are just trying to mislead the people by creating wrong perceptions,” Sampla said while speaking to media persons at Adampur domestic airport after foundation stone laying of a new enclave. He said that debate should not stoop to a level that people start losing respect for the armed forces who protect the country. “It is due to these forces that everybody is feeling secure but bringing the forces under question mark is shameful,” he argued.

Hitting out at the opposition for seeking proof of the Indian Air Force's action, Modi said the air strike happened in Pakistan, but ""some of those sitting in India were hit by it"". Addressing a rally in Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh, PM Modi said India gave a befitting reply to the Pulwama attack by entering the den of terrorists in Pakistan.

""These 'mahamilavati' persons have become poster boys of Pakistan by terming it as an ambassador of peace. They are misleading people of the country and trying to demoralise our armed forces by asking for proofs of the IAF air strike,"" Modi said. Without naming   senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh,   he said a leader termed the Pulwama attack as an ""accident"" and dubbed slain al-Qaida terrorist Osama bin Laden as an ""ambassador of peace"". ""A leader close to the Congress' naamdar (Rahul Gandhi) family has termed the Pulwama attack a mere accident. He also considers Osama Bin Laden a shantidoot (ambassador of peace).

Another senior leader close to the Congress' ""namdaar"" family shed tears after the Batla House encounter, he said. ""The party whose leaders shed tears on the death of terrorists can't be expected to wipe out terrorism,"" the PM said, adding that earlier Congress government kept quiet after terror attacks.

BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also seized on Digvijaya Singh's tweet, terming the Pulwama terror attack an ""accident"", to mount a stinging attack on the opposition party to say its senior leaders are speaking the language of Pakistan.

Pakistan news:  3rd time in 9 days: Pakistan stops media from visiting madrassa bombed by IAF - Times of India,"JABA: Pakistani security officials on Thursday prevented a Reuters team from climbing a hill in northeastern Pakistan to the site of a madrassa and a group of surrounding buildings that was targeted by Indian warplanes last week. It is the third time in the past nine days that Reuters reporters have visited the area – and each time the path up to what villagers say was a religious school run at one time by terrorist group Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) and what the Indian government says was a ""terrorist"" training camp - was blocked. India's foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said on the day of the strike that it had killed ""a very large number of Jaish-e-Muhammed terrorists, trainers, senior commanders, and groups of jihadis"" at the training camp. The Pakistani security officials guarding the way to the site cited ""security concerns"" for denying access. They stuck to the Pakistani government's position ever since the Indian attack on February 26 that no damage was caused to any buildings and there was no loss of life. In Islamabad, the military's press wing has twice called off visits to the site for weather and organisational reasons and an official said no visit would be possible for a few days more due to security issues. Meanwhile, stepping up pressure on Pakistan, the   US has asked Islamabad   to take ""sustained and irreversible"" actions against terrorist groups operating from its territory to prevent future attacks and promote regional stability. The state department statement came as Pakistan, under global pressure after the Pulwama terror attack and   India's air strikes against Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM)   terrorist camp in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on February 26, started taking actions against some of the terrorist outfits and their leaders over the past few days. In Islamabad, the interior ministry on Thursday announced that a   total of 121 members   of the proscribed groups have so far been taken into ""preventive detention"" across Pakistan. State Department deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino told reporters at his biweekly news conference, ""I would say that we, the United States notes these steps and we continue to urge Pakistan to take sustained, irreversible actions against terrorist groups that will prevent future attacks and promote regional stability"". ""We reiterate our call for Pakistan to abide by its United Nations Security Council obligations to deny terrorists safe haven and block their entry to funds,"" he said. Responding to questions, Palladino refrained from giving a direct answer on the move at the United Nations Security Council to designate JeM chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist. However, he said that the US and its allies in the UN Security Council want to update the UN list of terrorist organisations and leaders. ""Our views on Masood Azhar and Jaish-e-Muhammed are well-known. Jaish-e-Muhammed is a United Nations-designated terrorist group that has been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and is a threat to regional stability. Masood Azhar is the founder and leader of JEM,"" Palladino said. Questions on the United Nations Sanctions Committee deliberations are confidential and as such it is not something that the state department is going to be able to comment on specific matters on the issue, he said. ""But we will continue to work with the sanctions committee to ensure that the list is updated and that it is accurate,"" Palladino said. At the US Capitol, India's ambassador to the US Harsh Vardhan Shringla met Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives and discussed the issue of terrorism. ""We must stand strong against acts of terrorism and work together to improve trade between our nations,"" the top Republican leader said after the meeting. India, Pakistan should turn the page, convert crisis into opportunity: ChinaChinese foreign minister Wang Yi, meanwhile, urged India and Pakistan to quickly   turn the page after the Pulwama   terror attack, meet each other halfway and convert the present tensions into an opportunity for long term and fundamental improvement in their relations. Wang also said post-Wuhan summit between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, China wants to develop closer ties with India and forge ahead like the ""Yangtze and Ganges"" rivers despite Beijing's all weather ties with Pakistan. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after   40 CRPF personnel were martyred   when a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) targeted a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. India launched a counter-terror operation in Balakot on February 26.

Pakistan extends airspace ban along eastern border with India till July 26 - Times of India,"LAHORE: For the fifth time, Pakistan extended its airspace ban along its eastern border with India till July 26, the country's civil aviation authority announced Friday. Pakistan fully closed its airspace on February 26 after the Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter jets struck a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist training camp in Balakot following the Pulwama terror attack in Kashmir. However, in March, it partially opened its airspace but kept its ban for the Indian flights. ""Pakistani airspace will be closed until July 26 along its eastern border with India. The Panjgoor airspace will remain open for overflying transit flights from the western side as Air India had already been using that airspace,"" the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said in a notice. A CAA official told PTI that the Pakistan government will review whether to open its space for Indian flights or not on July 26. ""However, this issue is a bilateral one and no progress will be made till both Islamabad and New Delhi decide it mutually,"" he said. Last month, Pakistan gave special permission to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's VVIP flight to use its airspace for his official trip to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. However Prime Minister Modi's VVIP aircraft avoided flying over Pakistan. Earlier, Pakistan had allowed India's former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to fly directly though Pakistani airspace to participate in the meeting of SCO foreign ministers in Bishkek on May 21. India aviation industry has suffered huge losses due to the airspace ban by Pakistan. On Thursday, India's civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri told Parliament that due to the closure of Pakistan airspace, Air India had to spend an extra Rs 430 crore on longer routes. Pakistan earlier indicated that it may lift the airspace ban along its eastern border with India imposed on February 27 to reciprocate India's decision to remove all restrictions on all air routes in its airspace. Pakistan's aviation secretary Shahrukh Nusrat said,"" The Indian government had asked us to open the airspace. We conveyed our concerns that first India must withdraw its fighter planes placed forward."" He said Pakistan was ready to open its airspace provided India de-escalates.

Pakistan likely to remove restriction on air space usage - Times of India,"LAHORE: Pakistan is likely to lift the airspace ban along its eastern border with India in reciprocation to India's decision to remove all the temporary restrictions on all air routes in the Indian air space, a senior Pakistani government official indicated on Saturday. The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Friday announced on Twitter: ""Temporary restrictions on all air routes in the Indian airspace, imposed by the Indian Air Force on 27 Feb 19, have been removed."" #Information : Temporary restrictions on all air routes in the Indian airspace, imposed by the Indian Air Force on… https://t.co/sJ3FLgVe7B— Indian Air Force (@IAF_MCC) 1559304407000Reacting to India's decision, a senior officials of the Pakistan government said, ""Once the Indian government lifts the air restriction on Pakistani flights, Pakistan is likely to reciprocate it."" The official told PTI that India has yet to inform Pakistan about lifting of airspace ban for its flights. ""We only heard about this through the media as there is no communication in this respect has taken place as yet. We may follow the suit once India lifts air restrictions on our flights,” he said. The IAF said it had removed restrictions that were imposed on all routes a day after its 12 Mirage 2000s crossed over to Pakistan and attacked a JeM terrorist training camp in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Pakistan fully closed its airspace on February 27 after an IAF strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot. On March 27, it opened its airspace for all flights except for New Delhi, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. On May 15, Pakistan extended its airspace ban for flights to India till May 30. As a result of the ban, foreign carriers using Indian airspace have been forced to take costly detours because they cannot fly over Pakistan. The closure mainly affects flights from Europe to Southeast Asia. The flights from Europe and the US flying in and out of New Delhi have been the worst hit. Thousands of travellers suffer flight cancellations, delays and soaring ticket prices due to Pakistan's decision to close its airspace for flights to and from India. Earlier, Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Mohammad Faisal had said Islamabad wanted de-escalation. ""If de-escalation takes place we would not like to have a ban on our airspace for India for a single day but for the purpose, India will have to talk to us,"" he had said.

 India will have 'all options' available in case there is another terror strike: Officials | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: India will have ""all options"" available in case there is another terror strike, official sources asserted on Tuesday while maintaining that the government will insist on concrete steps by Pakistan in dismantling terror infrastructure. Sources also said that India has shared with the US the   evidence of use of F-16 fighter jet   by Pakistan during retaliatory aerial combat and was confident that the US is investigating the matter. Since Balakot strike, India is trying to build maximum pressure on Pakistan on the issue of terrorism, sources said. Pakistan has gone to all countries seeking mediation but there is greater understanding of India's position, sources said, adding India has told the international community that it is not an India-Pakistan issue, but about terrorism. If Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar gets banned by the UN, Pakistan will get into a difficult situation as he has been residing there as per the   Pakistan foreign minister's admission.  Sources had said on Monday the Indian Air Force has kept all its bases in Western sector on maximum alert after India carried out a strike on the biggest terrorist training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26. Pakistan had attempted to retaliate by unsuccessfully targeting a number of military installations in Kashmir on February 27.

 Pakistan stands isolated on world stage post Balakot air strike: BJP leader | India News - Times of India,"MANGALURU: Pakistan stands isolated on the world stage ‘post-surgical strike 2’. A few leaders of ‘Mahaghatbandhan’ and intellectuals in India are the only ray of hope for the neighbouring nation, noted Kota Srinivas Poojary, leader of the opposition in state legislative council. On the other hand, India’s action in levelling terror camps at Balakot has received global backing from the superpowers on its right to defend territorial sovereignty, he said. Addressing media on Monday, Poojary said the clamour from disparate voices seeking proof of air strike on Balakot notwithstanding an audio tape admission by Maulana Ammar, brother of JeM chief Masood Azhar that air strikes had taken toll of a training centre for jihadis, is misplaced. The political parties seeking proof for the strikes are seeking to politicise the bravery and valour of our armed forces who strike at the enemy, he said. In the same vein, reported a statement of CM H D Kumaraswamy decrying street celebrations following the Balakot air strikes in that it would hurt sentiments of a particular community is also sad, he said. “I can’t believe this statement has come from him,” Poojary said, adding this (statement) is now a sad reality. The CM must take back his words, Poojary demanded, noting that using caste and religious equations for the armed forces is wrong. On PM Krishi Samman Nidhi Yojana, he slammed the tepid reaction of the state government in receiving applications from farmer beneficiaries in Karnataka. Against 76-lakh-odd farmer beneficiaries, the state government thus far has received only 16-lakh beneficiaries, he said, adding government must extend the facility to obtain applications to the grassroots level. If the government fails to do so, BJP reserves the right to launch an agitation, he said. Slamming election eve announcement of the formation of new taluks in Karnataka, Poojary said the state government is yet to provide facilities and transfer government offices to taluks already formed by the previous government. Claiming a mood favouring the BJP-led NDA government in the centre, Poojary advised the Congress to get their doubts regarding EVMs cleared now rather than crib over it once the general elections are over.

 Those questioning claims of air strike being dubbed anti national: Farooq Abdullah | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah Wednesday alleged those questioning claims on the Balakot air strike are being branded anti-nationals, and said the time has come for people to ask questions from those in power. Speaking at an event here, Abdullah turned sentimental as he expressed anguish over ""power-hungry"" people trying to go to any extent and spread ""hatred"" for more power, and said it hurts him to ""see my country dying"". ""Surgical strike, Oh wonderful!! We shot down their (Pakistan) plane and (if) you ask where is the proof of the plane you shot, or where is the proof as Amit Shah says that 300 people died -- you are anti-national you are against the country,"" Abdullah said. Last week, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale had said ""a very large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis who were being trained for fidayeen action were eliminated"" in the Indian Air Force strike, while the government sources said 350 terrorists were killed. Later, BJP president Amit Shah put the toll at 250. Abdullah alleged news channels were dishing out lies at the instance of vested interests. ""What do you see around? If you quote anything which they will not accept, you are anti-national, pro-Pakistan. Lies are being dished out by channels. The time has come when you should ask questions,"" he said. Abdullah's voice choked as he cited an anecdote about Guru Nanak Dev's visit to shrine of Kaaba. ""Who will save this nation? I see my country dying, it hurts me. Pray for an India that is blessed with love and peace and shines brighter than the Sun and stars,"" he said, overcome with emotion. He also expressed distress over situation in Kashmir, saying the youths in the Valley have ""gone astray"" and he struggles to think of ways they will be pulled back to normal life. Abdullah also condemned Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy's statement in which he favoured a call for the boycott of Kashmiri products and visiting the state as tourists, saying Jammu and Kashmir became a part of India because of Mahatma Gandhi, not for its might or wealth. Abdullah was addressing an event at the Institute of Social Science on former socialist leader George Fernandes, whom the National Conference chairman termed a leader who tried to know the reason behind militancy in Jammu and Kashmir.

" Amit Shah says 250 killed in Balakot air strike, but why PM or government not giving details: Congress | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Stepping up its offensive, Congress on Monday asked what was the basis for BJP chief Amit Shah's claim of 250 terrorists getting killed in Indian air force's air strike in Pakistan's Balakot and why was Prime Minister Narendra Modi or his government not giving the details of casualties. Congress spokesperson RPN Singh also accused the Prime Minister and BJP leadership of politicising the air strikes and said Modi should apologise to the country for trying to portray the Indian force as being weaker without Rafale. He counter-accused the BJP and its leaders of spreading misinformation and ""false propaganda"" over the air strikes ahead of elections and said the people of the country would give them a befitting reply. Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal also said that if Amit Shah is claiming 250 casualties of terrorists in the air strike, why the Prime Minister is not providing details of the number of deaths. Singh said, ""It is extremely shocking and tragic that the Prime Minister of this country is pointing fingers at opposition parties for questioning the army or the air force. ""It is completely false, everybody knows that after the tragic Pulwama attack (in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed in a suicide bomb attack) the Congress president and the Congress party clearly said that we stand with the government, we stand with the armed forces and with the people of this country to fight against terrorism."" Referring to BJP chief Shah's statement that 250 people were killed in the air strikes, Singh asked, ""Where is this number coming from and who is politicising this whole incident. Why is the Prime Minister not giving details and saying how many people have died in air strikes. Why is the government not confirming this."" He also said that a minister in the Prime Minister's council of ministers is claiming that the Prime Minister or the BJP leader have not claimed the number of deaths being 300. ""Then where is the number coming from?"" Singh asked. Amid a raging debate on the number of casualties in the strike, IAF chief BS Dhanoa on Monday said in Coimbatore that the air force doesn't count human casualties and it was for the government to provide details on the terrorists killed. While there has been no official statement on the number of deaths, the government sources had earlier said up to 350 terrorists were killed, BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday put the toll at 250 and some media reports have said damage has been minimal, prompting opposition leaders to clamour for clarity. The Congress leader said the Prime Minister has repeatedly pointed fingers at the Congress party and the BJP is repeatedly attacking the Congress and opposition for trivialising the bravery of our armed forces. ""Here is the Prime Minister, who says that the air force would have been much stronger if we had Rafale (fighter jets). We would like the Prime Minister to apologize for saying that..... ""The Prime Minister has tried to show that the air force is weaker because it does not have Rafale. We would like him to apologise for saying so because the Indian air force has always protected our skies and given a befitting reply, whenever it has been attacked by the Pakistanis,"" he said. ""We have seen posters of the BJP, which has a small photograph of Wing Commander Abhinandan (who was captured by Pakistan and later released) and a big photograph of Prime Minister Modi. Are we politicising it or is it the BJP which is politicising it? The people of this country will give them a befitting reply,"" Singh said. The Congress leader said his party has continuously supported the bravery of armed forces and the air force pilots and will continue to do so. He alleged the BJP and Prime Minister Modi were rather spreading ""false propaganda"" and disinformation against the opposition party. To a question on Congress leaders Sibal and Navjot Singh Sidhu demanding proof and evidence about the Balakot air strike, Singh said, ""We have very clearly articulated what the Congress stand is. We are asking, from where this figure of 250-300-350 is coming out (about casualties), including which Amit Shah is announcing. We have seen people of the BJP campaigning in army fatigues. Are they politicising it or we are politicising it?"" On Rafale comments by the Prime Minister, Singh said, ""... Even when he is sleeping, when he is eating, when he is speaking, he thinks about only Rafale, the Chowkidar (watchman), you know, what he has done. Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa very clearly stated that the MIG-21 Bison had the latest technology and can give a befitting reply to any aero plane of Pakistan and it actually did so."" Speaking in Gujarat on Monday, Modi hit out at the opposition for questioning his statement that the presence of Rafale fighters would have given greater firepower to the IAF and said, ""I said if Rafale was acquired in time it would have made a difference, but they say Modi is questioning our air force strike."" ""Please use common sense. What I said was if we had Rafale at the time, then none of our fighter jets would have gone down and none of theirs saved,"" he said. He also lashed out at those demanding proof of the February 26 air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot and said his objective was to end terror while that of the Opposition was to remove him.

 Balakot strike after intel on Pulwama ‘celebration’ meet | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Luck was clearly on its side as the Indian security establishment went about planning the air strikes on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s Balakot terrorist training facility in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Armed with information that 300-400 Jaish terrorists, including 25 top commanders, would converge on the Balakot camp on Monday to celebrate the Pulwama operation and plan further attacks in India, the Indian forces acted swiftly and virtually flattened the structure in precision air strikes. Top security officials here were pleasantly surprised how things panned out in their favour. First, Jaish, which many believed would turn extra cautious in the wake of pressure brought on it post-Pulwama, decided to get its top leaders and cadres under one roof. Second, the facility where they chose to assemble is far removed from civilian settlements and military camps, making it an ideal target for air strikes as there would be minimum collateral damage. Third, the strategy session that Jaish was holding at the Balakot facility — a modern structure complete with a playground, swimming pool, racing tracks, firing range and a social media war-room — was to discuss plans to wreak havoc in India by carrying out suicide attacks and bombings over the next two months, coinciding with the general elections. The intelligence gave Indian forces valid ground to launch pre-emptive strikes. The air strikes blew the Balakot facility to smithereens. Intelligence officials said given the extent of destruction, all occupants of the camp would have been killed. The importance of Balakot lies in the advanced training facilities it offered. Meant for ‘battle inoculation’ of Jaish fighters, it had several barracks to accommodate the trainees and is known to have housed 200 terrorists at any given time. Many trainers in Balakot were ex-personnel of Pakistan army and ISI. Sources said Masood Azhar and his brother Mufti Rauf Asghar used to visit the ‘five-star’ terror camp to radicalise and motivate the fidayeen. Alternatively, their videos would be shown to the trainees. Two JeM terrorists interrogated as ‘witnesses’ by the NIA after the Pathankot attack claimed recruits at Balakot camp would go through extensive motivational, physical, military and tactical training. Jihadi volunteers who successfully completed the basic terror training course — Daura-e-Aam, covering religious indoctrination, grenade throwing, use of small firearms and physical training — would undergo advanced terror training or ‘Daure-e-Khaas’ at the Jaish camp. The facilities covered training in use of big arms and weapons, handling of explosives, assembling IEDs, field tactics, tactics for attacking security convoys, preparations for suicide bombings, rigging vehicles for suicide attacks and survival in high altitude areas and extreme-stress situations. Even US authorities are familiar with the Balakot camp, having detained Hafez K Rahman, a fighter affiliated with Taliban. Rahman, a Pakistani, told the US authorities he had trained at Balakot camp that offered “basic and advanced terrorist training on explosives and artillery”.

"IAF strikes latest news: Bombs used in air strikes had Jaish coordinates fed in, little chance of their missing targets | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: The computer memories of Spice-2000 precision guided bombs were fed with satellite images and exact geographical coordinates of the major Jaish-e-Mohammed  training camp at Balakot   in Pakistan before being loaded on IAF Mirage-2000 fighters at Gwalior for the February 26 pre-dawn strikes. Military has proof of hit on Balakot Jaish camp; up to govt to release itSo, when the “clear to launch weapons” signals popped up on the computers of the Mirage-2000 fighters, which were then — depending on their altitude and angle of attack — around 2 km to 10 km across the Line of Control into Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir, there was little chance of the 1,000-kg bombs missing their targets. “With their navigation\seeker systems, the fire-and-forget Spice-2000 bombs homed into the four to six targets selected within the JeM facility around 50 to 60 km away. The error margin was less than 3 metres,” said a top defence source on Saturday. The “before and after” images captured by the high-resolution synthetic aperture radars (SARs) mounted on “classified platforms” as well as Sukhoi-30MKI fighters, which were part of the “strike package”, show the designated targets were hit with precision, as reported by TOI on Saturday. Though an accurate assessment of casualties on the ground is virtually impossible, the Spice-2000 bombs armed with “digital scene-matching area correlators” penetrated the roofs of the pre-selected buildings in the terror facility, which would have “killed all the inmates in them with shock and blast waves”, said sources. Interestingly, the IAF also deployed “a decoy package” of fighters ostensibly headed towards the JeM headquarters in Bahawalpur in the Punjab province to lure Pakistani combat air patrols away from the actual “strike package” that had the Balakot facility in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in its cross-hairs in the wee hours of February 26. This was in addition to the Mirage-2000s and Sukhoi-30MKIs, IL-78 mid-air refuellers and AWACS (airborne warning and control system) aircraft being deployed from Gwalior, Agra and Bareilly, instead of forward airbases, which took a circuitous route to the Muzaffarabad sector along the LoC to retain the element of surprise for the strikes, as was earlier reported by TOI. “The decoy package of Sukhoi-30MKIs, in turn, took off from our Punjab to fake a strike operation towards Bahawalpur. Pakistan was taken in by the decoy formation and vectored its fighters in the air towards it,” said another source. “Consequently, there was no Pakistani fighter anywhere near the actual strike package … the closest one would have been well over 150 km away. This also nails Pakistan’s claim that IAF fighters hastily dropped their bombs without achieving anything, much like its other factually incorrect statements like it did not use F-16s in the air intrusion on February 27,” he added. The IAF cross-border strike, and that too well inside Pakistan instead of restricting it to POK, has redrawn India’s self-imposed red-lines, which earlier held that any use of airpower would be a sharply escalatory step in the complicated dynamics between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. “If the IAF had been told not to cross the LoC, like it was directed during the 1999 Kargil conflict, the weapons package to be used would have been quite different,” said the source.

Such things should not be spoken. There should be no politics on this issue which concerns national unity and integrity. The popular sentiment must be respected, the chief minister told reporters here.

The opposition leaders have been citing international media reports which claim that the IAF operation in Balakot had caused no casualties, contrary to claims by some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders that hundreds of terrorists were killed. It should be understood that the respect for the armed forces has further increased in the wake of the recent operations. The popular sentiment is also appreciative of the governments handling of the crisis. This should be kept in mind, the JD(U) national president said.

IAF attack on Pak Full text: India on IAF strike at biggest Jaish terror camp in Pakistan Full text: India on IAF strike at biggest Jaish terror camp in Pakistan | India News - Times of India,"On 14 February 2019, a suicide terror attack was conducted by a Pak based terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad, leading to the martyrdom of 40 brave jawans of the CRPF. JeM has been active in Pakistan for the last two decades, and is led by MASOOD AZHAR with its headquarters in Bahawalpur. This organization, which is proscribed by the UN, has been responsible of a series of terrorist attacks including on the Indian Parliament in December 2001 and the Pathankot airbase in January 2016. Information regarding the location of training camps in Pakistan and PoJK has been provided to Pakistan from time to time. Pakistan, however, denies their existence. The existence of such massive training facilities capable of training hundreds of jidhadis could not have functioned without the knowledge of Pakistan authorities. India has been repeatedly urging Pakistan to take action against the JeM to prevent jihadis from being trained and armed inside Pakistan. Pakistan has taken no concrete actions to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism on its soil. Live: Many terrorists killed in IAF strike on JeM camp at Balakot in PakCredible intelligence was received that JeM was attempting another suicide terror attack in various parts of the country, and the fidayeen jihadis were being trained for this purpose. In the face of imminent danger, a preemptive strike became absolutely necessary. Surgical strikes 2: IAF crosses LoC for the first time since 1971 warIn an intelligence led operation in the early hours of today, India struck the biggest training camp of JeM in Balakot. In this operation, a very large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis who were being trained for fidayeen action were eliminated. This facility at Balakot was headed by MAULANA YOUSUF AZHAR (alias USTAD GHOURI), the brother-in-law of MASOOD AZHAR, Chief of JeM. Surgical strike 2.0? India bombs terror camps across LoC in Pakistani sideThe Government of India is firmly and resolutely committed to taking all necessary measures to fight the menace of terrorism. Hence this non-military preemptive action was specifically targeted at the JeM camp. The selection of the target was also conditioned by our desire to avoid civilian casualties. The facility is located in thick forest on a hilltop far away from any civilian presence. As the strike has taken place only a short while ago, we are awaiting further details. The Government of Pakistan had made a solemn commitment in January 2004 not to allow its soil or territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India. We expect that Pakistan lives up to its public commitment and takes follow up actions to dismantle all JeM and other camps and hold the terrorists accountable for the actions.

 ‘Now we can sleep in peace’: Relatives of Pulwama martyrs hail IAF air strike | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The mood in the house of Prasanna Kumar Sahoo — the 48-year-old CRPF head constable who was slain in the recent terror attack in Pulwama — on Tuesday was that of relief mingled with joy. The family said it will now sleep in peace knowing the deaths have been avenged, after nearly two weeks of restless nights. Like the Sahoo household, most of the families of the 40 CRPF jawans who were killed in the terror attack are now relieved, but some also say there needs to be sustained pressure to dismantle terror camps. “We have not slept properly since the night of the Pulwama attack,” said Jagan, Sahoo’s 16-year-old son. Sahoo’s widow Meena has spoken little since her husband died. On Tuesday, however, she managed a weak smile. “After my husband’s death, my life was shattered. Today, I am grateful,” she said. “Our loss is irreparable, but we are satisfied with what the government has done,” Mahesh Gurjar, a cousin of jawan Narayan Lal Gurjar — who also died in Pulwama, said. In Jaipur too, the slain jawans’ families were smiling again. “We are overjoyed that people have not forgotten my brother’s sacrifice,” said Jeetendra Lamba, jawan Rohitash Lamba’s younger brother. “Since his death, this is the first time that we smiled.” Thousands of kilometers away, in Karnataka’s Mandya dsitrict, similar scenes of jubilation filled the streets of slain jawan H Guru’s hometown. “I feel this action will give peace to the martyred,” said Kalavathi, Guru’s widow. In UP’s , Renu, widow of Ramesh Yadav, is grateful, saying, “Pakistan isi karyawahi ka hakdaar hai (Pakistan is entitled to such action).” However, many voiced the need for further action. “Although we are happy with what was done by IAF, families of martyrs will be completely relieved and satisfied when terrorism is totally rooted out,” said Ramvilas, the elder brother of CRPF’s Hemraj Meena. However, the family of Pulwama victim Pradeep Kumar cast aspersions on the number of casualties in Balakot. His widow Sarmishtha Devi said, “We’re not satisfied. When Pulwama attack occurred, everyone saw the bodies of our jawans. There was clear evidence. Here, we simply have claims.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
F16 news: US count of Pakistan's F-16 fighter jets found none of them missing: Report | World News - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: A US count of the F-16s with Pakistan has found that none of them are ""missing"" and all the fighter planes were ""present and accounted for"", according to a report in a prominent American magazine. The finding by the US on the ground in Pakistan ""directly contradicts"" India's claim that its air force shot down an F-16 fighter jet during an aerial dogfight on February 27. The   Indian Air Force on February 28 displayed pieces of the AMRAAM   missile, fired by a Pakistani F-16, as evidence to ""conclusively"" prove that Pakistan deployed US-manufactured F-16 fighter jets during an aerial raid targeting Indian military installations in Kashmir. Pakistan had categorically said that no F-16 fighter jets were used and denied that one of its planes had been downed by the IAF. According to the Foreign Policy magazine, Pakistan invited the United States to physically count its F-16 planes after the incident as part of an end-user agreement signed when the foreign military sale was finalised. ""A US count of Pakistan's F-16 fleet has found that all the jets are present and accounted for, a direct contradiction to India's claim that it shot down one of the fighter jets during a February clash,"" Lara Seligman of the magazine reported on Thursday. The count of the F-16 fighter planes in Pakistan has been completed, and ""all aircraft were present and accounted for,"" an unnamed defence official was quoted as saying by the magazine. The Department of Defence did not immediately respond to a question on its count of F-16 fighter jets in Pakistan. ""As details come out, it looks worse and worse for the Indians,"" MIT professor Vipin Narang told Foreign Policy magazine. ""It looks increasingly like India failed to impose significant costs on Pakistan, but lost a plane and a helicopter of its own in the process,"" he said. Generally, in such agreements, the US requires the receiving country to allow its officials to inspect the equipment regularly to ensure it is accounted for and protected, the news report said. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the suicide bomber of   JeM killed 40 CRPF personnel   in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. India launched a counter-terror operation against a JeM training camp in Balakot. The next day, Pakistan Air Force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured its pilot, who was handed over to India on March 1.

"Imran Khan admits Balakot strike took place, says India planning something even bigger in PoK - Times of India","MUZAFFARABAD (PoK): In an indirect admission that the Balakot was a major operation that rattled Pakistan, country's Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Wednesday that India was planning an even bigger operation in PoK in the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 by New Delhi. ""We have information and we have had two National Security Committee (NSC) meetings. The Pakistan Army has full knowledge that India has made a plan to take action in PoK. Just like how after Pulwama, they took the action in Balakot, according to the information we have, they have made more sinister plans now,"" Khan said while addressing the Legislative Assembly here on the occasion of 73rd Independence Day of Pakistan. In the early morning hours of February 26, the Indian warplanes had crossed over to Pakistan and attacked Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist training camp in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avenge the deadly Pulwama attack. While India had insisted that it killed a large number of JeM group terrorists and destroyed their camp, Pakistan had said that the bombs had landed in an empty area and caused no casualties. More than a month after this claim, Pakistan authorities had allowed a delegation of about a dozen people including foreign media and defence attaches to visit the site in an attempt to prove that nothing of the sort as claimed by India had happened there. In his address on Wednesday, Khan said that the ""hateful ideology"" of the BJP and the RSS would not remain limited to Kashmir, but eventually spill towards Pakistan, following which they would take such action. Khan threatened serious consequences if such an action takes place. ""Our Army is prepared,"" said Khan. ""Not just the army, but the entire nation would fight alongside our military... we will respond to whatever they do,"" said Khan. Oddly, most of Khan's 30-plus minute address on Pakistan's Independence Day was ""devoted"" to attacking the BJP and the RSS. At one point, he even went on to call himself the Ambassador of Kashmir, adding that he would raise the matter on every international forum, and take it to the United Nations as well as the International Court of Justice. ""We will go to the United National. We will go to every global forum, as well as the International Court of Justice. We are mobilising the global community of Kashmiris and you will see a historic number of people coming out,"" he said. Khan said that Pakistan needs to make the world realise that the ideology of the RSS is exactly like Nazis and that the India of today is no more tolerant, plural, or secular as it once was. ""We have to make the world realise that the ideology of the RSS is exactly like the Nazi ideology. After World War II, the world made a collective decision that such genocide would never be repeated. The RSS ideology is heading that way again,"" Khan said. ""This is the ideology that has done ethnic cleansing in the world, that has created wars. People have no idea how much India has radicalised. It is no longer a plural or secular society. The facade of a tolerant India has been removed,"" he added. He went on to say that the goons of the RSS are lynching people, threatening judges, intellectuals, and deeming anyone who speaks against them as anti-nationals, which is ""exactly what the Nazis did. India is heading towards disaster with extremist ideology"". India's historic move has rattled Pakistan, following which it has undertaken a series of decisions, including downgrading bilateral relations with India and suspending bilateral trade, halting Samjhauta and Thar Express trains from its side and banning Indian movies in Pakistani cinemas.

 Pakistan trying to defame India after IAF air strikes: Rajnath Singh | India News - Times of India,"BILASPUR: Union home minister Rajnath Singh Wednesday said the Indian Air Force (IAF) air strike on terror camps in Pakistan was carried out with caution and no civilian was hurt in it, but the neighbouring country wants to defame India nevertheless. India has given a befitting reply to the neighbouring country, Singh said and reiterated that Kashmir will always be a part of India and no power in the world can separate it from the country. Addressing a convention of BJP workers in Bilaspur town of Chhattisgarh, he said, ""Two days back, our forces gave a befitting reply to Pakistan, which has been trying to destabilise India"". ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured that we will not let the country be subjugated. Our government will do whatever is required but will not let Mother India bow her head,"" he said. ""In the air strike, neither the Pakistani civilians were hurt nor the Pakistan Army was targeted. Our Air Force soldiers carried out the strike with caution. Despite this, Pakistan has been trying to defame India,"" he said. The BJP-led NDA government is not a weak regime, Singh said. India is no more a weak country, rather it has become strong,"" he added. India had earlier told Pakistan it could seek help from India if it was unable to root out terrorism on its own, he said. But the neighbouring country was never ready for it, he added. ""India had told Pakistan several times that terrorism was being nourished on their soil. Pakistan has been giving shelter to terrorists. However, Pakistan's prime minister used to say that his country was also a victim of terrorism. ""If you are a victim of terrorism, what have you done to root out the menace from your soil. The Pakistan PM has no answer for it,"" he said.

 Mandate rid nation of dynasty politics: Amit Shah on LS election results | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: BJP president Amit Shah on Saturday said the air strike against terror training camps in Pakistan’s Balakot in response to the Pulwama terror attack was also a reply to those who had dismissed the cross-LoC surgical strike of September 2016 as a ‘fluke’. Speaking at the NDA parliamentary party meeting, Shah said the surgical strike and the Balakot air strikes proved that India has a leader who could target terrorists in their own backyard. “During the 90s, when terrorism raised its head and shook the country, people felt that the then governments were not serious about the safety and security of the country. For the first time under the Modi government, people have confidence that here is a leader who can hit the terrorists in their den,” he said. He said the massive mandate underlined that governments will be elected on the basis of their performance, not dynasty, caste or appeasement politics. Noting that he has worked closely with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for many years, Shah said he didn’t take a single leave in 20 years. “I’ve never seen him being lazy and he works for 18 hours a day,” added Shah. He said when Modi became the PM for the first time in 2014, ordinary citizens were filled with hope that a person from a modest background could be elected to the highest office. “With that hope, people have trusted Modi. The success of the extension of Gujarat model to the whole country was an experiment and people have blessed Modi once again. What Modi promised, he has been able to deliver, and this trust has been shown by the people in him,” he said. Shah said the 22 crore poor who have been the beneficiaries of the PM’s welfare schemes have shown their faith in him. He said he has toured the country from Kashmir to Kanyaumari and Kamakhya to Kutch, and people in all parts of the country have unanimously voted in favour of Modi. “There has been a Modi Tsunami in the country,” he said. “Without any taint, he (Modi) has been elected as the country’s PM for the second term. This has been possible because he governed the country by rising above vote-bank politics. In the last five years, he took many tough decisions, but none that did not benefit the country,” the BJP president said.

Modi should be given credit for Balakot air strike just like Indira was for 1971 war: Rajnath Singh - Times of India,"BHUBANESWAR: Union home minister Rajnath Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be given credit for giving befitting reply to terror attack in Pulwama with Balakot air strike by Indian Air Force as Indira Gandhi was praised for defeating Pakistan in 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. “After India defeated Pakistan in 1971 people of India praised Indira Gandhi and our leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee complemented her in the parliament and assured all support to him. But now the opposition demanded proof of Balakot strike and number of casualties. What is wrong in praising Modiji for giving reply of Pulwama terror attack?” he asked. Singh also hit out at the Congress government for keeping quiet and not taking any action against Pakistan-based terrorist organisation after Mumbai terror attacks in 2008. “It is our policy that we don’t tease anyone but if someone teases us we don’t let them go. This is the difference between BJP and Congress,” he said. Singh on Friday addressed several campaign rallies at Karanjia, Cuttack and Puri, where elections will be held during the third phase on April 23, BJP’s senior leader Singh, promised to set up a sugar factory in Puri and to promote Chhau dance, if BJP forms government in the Centre. Singh also criticised the Congress for using ‘abusive words’ against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Prime ministers and presidents are institutions and not individuals. It is the responsibility of each political party and citizen of the country to show respect to them. In the history of India no one has ever used abusing words for any prime minister ever. The opposition leaders don’t have control over their mouth and I urge the people of Odisha to give befitting reply to the insult to the prime minister in votes,” Singh said. In his unique style, Singh said, “Chowkidaar is not chor, but hamara chowkidar is pure. Dobara uska PM banna sure he, desh ki sari samasyaon ka wohi cure he…Modi once more he.” Singh also slammed Congress for its promise to eradicate poverty and said, “With due respect to Nehruji, he first promised to finish poverty. Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi also told that poverty will be finished. Now Rahul Gandhi is saying that he will finish poverty, but why poverty did not end over the years.” Quoting a survey by an US-based institute Singh said, the number of people living in acute poverty in India was 12.5 crore in 2016 which has come down to 5.5 crore by 2019. Singh said, India has emerged as a strong country in the last five years and assured that in the next few years India will be among the top five countries of the world like China, Russia and US. He also urged the people of Odisha to vote for BJP government in Centre and state to bring development to Odisha as BJD failed to do so in the last 20 years.

" 1st surgical strike was in 2016, says Army’s northern command chief | India News - Times of India","JAMMU: Amidst the protracted political battle between BJP and Congress over the Balakot surgical strikes, Northern Army Command chief Lt-General Ranbir Singh said on Monday that the Director General of Military Operations, in a recent reply to an RTI query, had already clarified that the first surgical strike was conducted in September 2016. “I don’t want to go into what political parties say, they will be given an answer by the government. What I have told you is a statement of fact,” he added. Congress had claimed that as many as six surgical strikes were conducted during the previous UPA regime to challenge the Modi-led NDA government’s assertion that it was the first to clear such a cross-border military action after the Uri terror attack — in which 19 soldiers were killed — in 2016. Singh, on his part, also lauded the IAF for carrying out the pre-dawn aerial strikes on the JeM facility at Balakot on February 26. “Our aircraft penetrated deep into their territory and carried out the attacks... Our deterrence, our articulation and our military strategy have always been clear: Should there be any misadventure by the Pakistan, there will be given a befitting reply,” he said. Turning to the current situation along the Line of Control, the senior Army officer said, “Pakistan has continued with its anti-India activities like promoting cross border infiltration, ceasefire violations, drug trafficking, narcotics and pushing fake Indian currency.” Singh said the security situation in J&K was “firmly under control” and as many as 86 terrorists neutralized this year. “As far as the hinterland is concerned, we have recently finished with the elections in the state. It is to the credit of the security forces, administration in the state that we have had very peaceful, free and fair elections,” he added. “While we have ensured peaceful elections, we have also continued our efforts of neutralizing the terrorists on very hard inputs from various intelligence agencies that led to surgical operations.

Narendra Modi:  PM Modi’s remark on cloud cover registers on opposition’s radar - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Opposition parties led by Congress attacked PM Narendra Modi on Sunday for his remarks that cloud cover “helped” IAF planes evade Pakistani radars during the Balakot strikes, with political leaders calling the statement “ridiculous and false”. In response to a tweet by BJP on Modi's comment, Congress tweeted a couplet, “Jumla hi fekta raha paanch saal ki sarkar mein, socha tha cloudy hai mausam, nahin aaunga radar mein. (He resorted to empty rhetoric during his five-year tenure hoping cloudy weather would keep him off the radar).” Jumla hi fekta raha paanch saal ki sarkar mein, Socha tha cloudy hai mausam, Nahi aaunga radar mein. https://t.co/xDeOg4Yq5K— Congress (@INCIndia) 1557629681000The party attributed the couplet to ‘Mirza Cloudy’, with a photoshopped image of the PM dressed as Mirza Ghalib. In an interview to a TV channel on Saturday, Modi said he used “raw wisdom” to dispel doubts of defence experts who wanted the air strike deferred due to bad weather. “The weather was not good on the day of air strikes. There was a thought that crept in the minds of the experts that the day of strike should be changed. However, I suggested that the clouds could actually help our planes escape the radars,” Modi said while talking about the crossborder strike on terror camps in response to the Pulwama attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said, “Pakistani radar doesn't penetrate clouds. This is an important piece of tactical information that will be critical when planning future air strikes.” PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti added, “I was raked over the coals for questioning veracity of Balakot strikes. But seeing Pakistani media and journalists troll PM on cloud gaffe is awfully embarrassing. BJP's ability to suspend logic in its quest to win another term is mind numbingly fatuous. Our armed forces don't deserve this.” CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury alleged Modi’s TV interview “gave out operational details of a sensitive military mission with a purpose to influence voters during the silent period of the campaign” and wrote to the Election Commission demanding this be recorded and acted upon. Yechury also said Modi had “insulted” the IAF. “National security is not something to be trifled with. Such an irresponsible statement from Modi is highly damaging. Somebody like this can't remain India's PM. Modi's ridiculous comments on radars, clouds and fighter jets have been deservedly mocked but the EC needs to act against him for invoking armed forces hours before the sixth phase of voting. Letter to EC asking for prompt and strict action on this flagrant violation,” Yechury said. Congress MP Rajeev Satav said, “Modiji, I totally understand that you are an expert in planning 'escape' operations including that of Nirav Modi, Mehul Bhai and Vijay Mallya as they were never on your radar. Your cloud cover remarks speak volumes about your understanding and knowledge of national security.” In Video:Opposition slams PM Narendra Modi over 'cloud cover' remarkDownload The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."

 500 terrorists waiting to sneak in: Army chief | India News - Times of India,"CHENNAI: Chief of Army Staff, General Bipin Rawat on Monday said that at least 500 “well-trained” terrorists are waiting to infiltrate from Pakistan into Jammu and Kashmir, but the armed forces are fully prepared to deal with any situation that’s created to jeopardise efforts to restore peace in the Valley. Rawat also said that the terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot, which was destroyed in Indian air strikes in February this year, has been reactivated. “If needed, there will be no hesitation to go beyond Balakot... But we would like to keep them guessing,” he said. The Army chief was referring to the Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp which was targeted by IAF fighter jets on February 26, in retaliation to the ambush attack on the CRPF convoy in Kashmir’s Pulwama on February 14, which was claimed by the Pakistan-based outfit and killed 40 personnel of the paramilitary force. Speaking to reporters after inaugurating the Young Leaders Training Wing at Officers Training Academy in Chennai, Rawat said additional troops have been deployed along the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) to prevent any terrorist infiltration. “There is state-sponsored terrorism from the western neighbour and terrorists come in to create violence in the Valley,” he added. Life was returning to normal in the Valley, Rawat said. “The backdoors of shops are open and people are buying things. The front doors are closed because the terrorists are forcing them to be shut,” he said. The Army chief mentioned that brick kilns near Srinagar are functioning, more than 100 truckloads of apples are coming out daily from the orchards. Phone lines are working. Sand is being mined from Jhelum river. “You can go to apple orchards and you can see heaps of apples that have been plucked and packed into boxes. Hundreds of trucks have come out. Who is plucking these apples? Who is packing them into boxes, who is loading them into these trucks and who takes the trucks out from the valley? The clampdown is a facade created or spread by the terrorists to send a wrong signal to the world,” he said. There is a communication breakdown but that is between the terrorists and their handlers, Rawat added. On the ground situation in the Valley, the army chief said “killings are down and the terrorists have been kept at bay. If there is a clampdown how is it that people are going about their life. Flights are being operated to Srinagar and taxis are plying. There is no problem for people in getting essentials.” However, Rawat did not say till when military control will continue. “Interpretation of Islam by some is affecting the people who get carried away. We need preachers who can spread the correct meaning of Islam.” In Video:There's a communication breakdown between terrorists and their handlers in Pak: Army chiefDownload The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

A resident of Sikar, Digendra Kumar was serving in Rajputana Rifles as Naik at the time of the war. Patriotism and valour runs deep in the family of Digendra as his father and maternal grandfather were freedom fighters. At the the time of Kargil war, Digendra along with two of his brothers were posted at Kargil, thus taking forward his family legacy. “It was a matter of pride for me and my family when we heard the news. Since our childhood, we have been listening to stories of the valour of Maharana Pratap and Shivaji. The inclusion of the martyrs’ stories will inspire the future generations to join the Army and to work towards the upliftment of the nation,” said Digendra with pride. State education minister, Govind Singh Dotasra while talking to TOI said, “This chapter will inspire students and will instil nationalism in them. We have decided to introduce the Balakot air strikes in the Class IX Social Science textbook as well. Our aim is not to give any political statements. This is not about us, but about the brave soldiers who have made immense sacrifices for the nation.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."

No violation of the model code of conduct or advisories issued by EC was found in these cases, said ECsources. Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa had dissented in the decision on PM's Chitradurga remarks apart from four other instances earlier.

Six complaints are still pending. However, it took EC an average 18 days to decide complaints citing 8 cases of model code/advisory breach filed against Modi. Four complaints have been received against Congress president Rahul Gandhi and he has already got a clean chit in three of them. However, a decision remains pending on a fourth complaint relating to his remarks at Shahdol that Modi had enacted a law that allows tribals to be shot at.

Mention of IAF pilot Abhinandan by Shivraj Singh Chouhan not in line with advisory: EC official - Times of India,"INDORE: The Indore District Election Officer said on Thursday that a statement by senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan where he mentioned IAF pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was not in accordance with an advisory of the Election Commission (EC). The general advisory issued by the EC on March 19 had made it clear that there should be no mention of defence forces during campaigning, said district election officer Lokesh Kumar Jatav here. ""One part of the statement (by Chouhan) was not in accordance to this advisory,"" he said. He had sent his report to the Madhya Pradesh's Chief Electoral Officer, he added. Addressing a rally for BJP candidate from Indore Shankar Lalwani on Monday, Chouhan, a former chief minister, had said, ""A terrorist attack took place in Uri, which was followed by a surgical strike. ""Terrorists attacked in Pulwama, then there was an air strike (at Balakot in Pakistan) and our Abhinandan flew across the Pakistan border and shot down F-16 aircraft,"" he said. ""(Prime Minister Narendra) Modi said if Abhinandan received even the slightest injury, Pakistan would be wiped off the world map ... and Abhinandan returned in 72 hours,"" Chouhan had said.

Ashoka dismisses HDK’s claim on prior knowledge of Balakot type strikes | Mangaluru News - Times of India,"MANGALURU: Former home minister R Ashoka on Saturday ridiculed a claim by chief minister H D Kumaraswamy that a retired military officer had told him 2-years-ago that the Modi government would build a narrative about a war-like situation between India and Pakistan. The CM had claimed that the government would script a Balakot-style strike close to elections to politically benefit from military tension along the international border. Ashoka, who with other local BJP leaders performed ‘chappara muhurath’ for PM Narendra Modi’s April 13 rally at Nehru Maidan earlier, later told reporters that after this statement of the CM, one must wonder whether to believe him or the armed forces. “We have seen in the case of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman of how armed forces personnel put nation before self and don’t divulge state secrets even under the gravest of threats,” he said. “No armed forces personnel of any of the three wings or central armed police forces will ever share such sensitive information in the public domain – whether while serving or after retirement—he said,” adding every personnel is bound by the oath they taken when enlisting into the force – not to ever utter a word of their professional engagement ever. “They will never do such an act, and any former military officer disclosing such a big matter is ruled out,” he said. Taking a political pot-shot at his one-time boss, when Ashoka served as deputy CM under Kumaraswamy, the Padmanabhanagar MLA, in-charge of Modi’s political rallies in Karnataka, said, “Everyone knows the ease with which you lie. We have seen this in the case of former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda who said the 2014 elections would be his last, and several elections before that, and Kumaraswamy is continuing the same legacy.” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News."
 Union minister VK Singh invokes Israel to attack oppn over Balakot strike | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Union minister V K Singh Wednesday said people want India to emulate Israel in targeting terrorists but it cannot happen because the opposition in that country, unlike India, does not question and ""insult"" their army when it carries out tasks like 'Operation Munich'. In a sweeping Facebook post, he attacked government critics, including opposition members, students leaders, activists and media, and called for a ""surgical strike"" within India, claiming if it does not happen, then the ""robbers are ready to loot"". The former Army chief called student leaders accused of involvement in ""anti-India"" protests as ""jonk"" (leeches) and took aim at the media for referring to terrorists as ""militants"", claiming such things do not happen in Israel. It is high time that the country followed Israel, he said. He wrote the post amid a fierce slugfest between the government and opposition parties following the Balakot air strikes with the latter seeking proof that a high number of terrorists were killed, as claimed by ruling combine leaders including BJP president Amit Shah. The BJP has in turn accused its rivals of lowering the morale of armed forces and speaking the language of Pakistan. In a tweet, Singh also used a mosquito metaphor to refer to the debate on casualty figures of terrorists, asking if he was expected to sit and count how many he killed at night or ""sleep in comfort"". ""There were a lot of mosquitoes at 3:30 am at night. So, I used Hit (mosquito repellent) on them. Now, should I sit and count how many mosquitoes I killed or sleep in comfort,"" Singh tweeted. रात ३.३० बजे मच्छर बहुत थे, तो मैंने HIT मारा। अब मच्छर कितने मारे, ये गिनने बैठूँ, या आराम से सो जाऊँ? #GenerallySaying— Vijay Kumar Singh (@Gen_VKSingh) 1551841788000The Union minister headlined his Facebook post as ""Why India does not become Isreal?"". People want revenge and expect that Modi would enter Pakistan in a tank and finish off all Pakistanis, he said. ""We want to be in Israel mode overnight. No, it won't happen. If Modi is there, I have expectation and faith that revenge will be taken. It will be fierce and 100 times more intense. But India cannot be Israel and will not be Israel,"" he said in the post written in Hindi. He counted multiple reasons why he thinks India cannot become Israel. Because there is no JNU in Israel where youngsters can raise slogans in support of breaking the country, he said, in an apparent reference to the alleged anti-national protests in the university in February 2016. Because no courts are opened for terrorists at 2 am in night and nor does journalists there ""cry"" for human rights of terrorists, he went on. ""Because when Israel carries out Operation Munich, the opposition there does not insult the country or armed forces by seeking proof,"" Singh said, in an apparent reference to the covert operation of Israel spy agency Mossad to eliminate those involved in the terror attack on the country's 1972 Munich Olympics contingent in which several members were killed. A screenshot of VK Singh's Facebook page""There are no leeches (in Israel) like Shehla Rashid and Kanhaiya Kumar who study on taxpayers' money and call the Army rapists,"" he alleged. Singh said time has come for india to be like Israel so that its elected representatives know that the nation will be united for protecting its integrity and sovereignty not only during war but all the time, irrespective of any eventuality. The opposition has been asking the government to reveal the official death count in the strike which was conducted days after the February 14 Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF personnel died. While IAF chief B S Dhanoa said in a press conference that the force does not count bodies, BJP president Amit Shah claimed at a political rally that over 250 terrorists were killed.

UN ban on Azhar: China says 'responsible solution' can only come through talks - Times of India,"BEIJING: Amid reports that the resolution to declare Pakistan-based JeM chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist would come up in the UN Security Council on March 13, China on Monday said ""a responsible solution"" can only come through discussions. Beijing also said security issues constituted an ""important topic"" in its talks to ease tensions between Pakistan and India following the Pulwama terror attack. The US, the UK and France had moved a proposal at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) after the Pulwama terrorist attack to designate the chief of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) which claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack, as a global terrorist. According to reports the resolution was expected to be taken by the 1267 committee of the UNSC on March 13. China, which has blocked three times such moves by India and other members of the UNSC, is yet announce its stand. Asked about India's appeal and China's stand on the issue, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told media here, ""First I would like to say that the UNSC as a main body of the UN has strict standards and rules of procedures. Some reports have knowledge of inside information the UNSC. I don't know that can be counted as an evidence,"" he said. ""China's position on the designation of a terrorist by the 1267 Sanctions Committee is consistent and clear. China adopted a responsible attitude, follows the rules of the procedure of the committee and participated in the discussions in a responsible manner. Only through discussions can we come up with a responsible solution,"" he said. Recently Chinese vice foreign minister Kong Xuanyou travelled to Pakistan and held talks with prime minister Imran Khan and Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and other officials. India on Saturday said all the UNSC members were aware of the JeM training camps and the presence of Azhar in Pakistan, and urged the nations to designate him as a global terrorist. To another question whether Azhar's ban issue figured in China's talks with Pakistan, Lu said ""recently India and Pakistan has experienced a lot. We think those indents are not in the interest of peace and stability in the region"". ""We have engaged in mediation efforts with both sides and held talks to promote the easing of tensions. We made enormous efforts. While exchanging ideas security is an important topic and I can say that our talks were wide ranging quite deep,"" he said. Tensions flared up between India and Pakistan after a suicide bomber of JeM killed 40 CRPF personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting the biggest JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The next day, Pakistan Air Force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured Indian pilot, who was handed over to India on March 1.

 We are committed to meet India's energy security needs: Saudi Arabia | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Notwithstanding the biggest-ever attacks on its oil facilities, Saudi Arabia has said it is committed to meet India's energy security needs and will work constructively with other oil producers to maintain market stability. Saudi Ambassador Dr. Saud bin Mohammed Al Sati, in an exclusive interview to PTI, said his country will invite the United Nations and international experts to view the situation on the ground and to participate in the investigation into the attacks. He said Saudi Arabia has the capability and resolve to defend itself and to forcefully respond to ""these aggressions"", and appreciated India's support and solidarity to Riyadh following the strikes which, he asserted, were ""against the international community as a whole"". A series of drone and missile attacks on oil facilities of Saudi Aramco, the country's national petroleum company, on September 14 knocked out half of its daily oil production, severely impacting the global oil market and triggering fresh tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran. ""As the investigations are ongoing, the Kingdom will invite UN and international experts to view the situation on ground and to participate in the investigations,"" the ambassador said. ""The Kingdom will take appropriate measures to ensure its security and stability. The Kingdom affirms that it has the capability and resolve to defend its land and people, and to forcefully respond to these aggressions,"" he said. Yemen's Houthi terror group has taken responsibility for the biggest-ever attacks on Saudi oil facilities which severely impacted global oil supply. Saudi Arabia and its ally, the US, have blamed Iran for the attacks but Tehran has strongly denied the allegations. ""The recent attack against Saudi Aramco was not only against the Kingdom, but against the international community as a whole, and was a deliberate attempt to disrupt the global economy. Therefore, the perpetrators should be held accountable,"" the envoy said. Asked whether Saudi Arabia will increase oil supply to India to address the shortfall due to curb on import of oil from Iran, the envoy said his country is committed to India's energy security and will meet any shortfall that may arise due to disruptions from other sources. He said as one of the world's leading energy producers, Saudi Arabia will continue working constructively with other producers within and outside OPEC to maintain market stability, thus protecting all the interests of producers and consumers alike. OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a 14-nation powerful bloc of oil producing countries. ""India condemned the attacks on our oil facilities and reiterated its resolve to oppose terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. As a friend and strategic partner, we appreciate India's support and solidarity,"" Al Sati said. He said initial investigations have indicated that the weapons used in the attack were Iranian, adding probe was going on to determine the source of the strike. ""The Kingdom condemns this egregious crime which threatens international peace and security and affirms that the primary target of this attack is in line with the previous attacks against Saudi Aramco pumping stations using Iranian weapons,"" he said. ""The Kingdom calls upon the international community to assume its responsibility in condemning those that stand behind this act, and to take a firm and clear position against this reckless behaviour that threatens the global economy,"" he said. The envoy said Saudi Arabia will continue working with its partners and allies in stabilising the security of the region. India's relations with Saudi Arabia have been on an upswing over the last few years based on burgeoning energy ties besides cooperation in several other areas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Riyadh in 2016 put bilateral ties on a new trajectory. There are over 2.96 million Indian nationals working in Saudi Arabia, the largest expatriate community in the country. PTI MPB Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Balakot terror camp: All you need to know | India News - Times of India,"* The Balakot-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp destroyed by the Indian Air Force was located on the bank of the Kunhar river in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan and was used for ""battle inoculation"", where the trainers were retired officers of the Pakistan Army, government sources said. * The camp was also used by the Hizbul Mujahideen terror group, sources said. * Hundreds of terrorists and their trainers were shifted from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to a five-star, resort style camp in a hilltop forest in Balakot after the Pulwama attack, providing Indian forces with ""a sitting duck target"" when they carried out an air strike early Tuesday, killing up to 350 terrorists, sources said. * Sources said at least 325 terrorists and 25 to 27 trainers were at the camp, the biggest operated by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad group, which had claimed responsibility for the February 14 suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Kashmir that killed 40 jawans. * Yousuf Azhar, who headed the Balakot camp, is wanted by the CBI in the IC-814 hijacking case with a pending Interpol red corner notice against him since 2000. He is the brother-in-law of Masood Azhar, chief of Jaish-e-Mohammad. * Explaining how the air strikes were carried out, sources said that everyone at the camp was sleeping and Pakistani defence establishment had no clue that the attack was coming so deep into their country because they had expected a surgical strike on camps in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir near the Line of Control. * Fighter and other aircraft took off from several air bases in Western and Central commands at about the same time, leaving Pakistani defence officials confused as to where they were heading, the sources said. A small group of aircraft broke away from the swarm and headed to Balakot where ""the sleeping terrorists were sitting ducks for the Indian bombing,"" said one source. * The Balakot camp was an important training centre for the JeM and other terror organisations and it had several structures to accommodate terrorist trainees and facilities to train them. The camp could facilitate 500 to 700 people, and even had a swimming pool along with cooks and cleaners. * Situated on the Kunhar river, the Balakot camp offered possibility of aquatic training to terrorists and housed hundreds of terrorists, the sources said. * The camp, 20 kms from the Balakot town, was used for ""battle inoculation"" and its trainers were ex-officers of the Pakistan Army. Several ""inspirational lectures"" were delivered at this camp by JeM founder and terror mastermind Masood Azhar and other terrorist leaders on several occasions. * Balakot town is some 80 km from the Line of Control near Abbottabad where Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in hiding by covert U.S. forces who had also sneaked into Pakistan to carry out the operation, catching the entire Pakistani military unawares. * The camp was used to train Masood Azhar's relatives and cadres in advanced weapons and tactics. * Before the inception of JeM, the camp was also used by the Hizbul Mujahideen, the sources said.* In the Balakot camp, the terrorists were imparted the advanced 'Daura-e-Khaas' training in weapons, explosives and field tactics, attack on convoys of security forces, planting and making of IEDs, suicide bombing, rigging vehicles for suicide attacks and survival tactics in high altitudes and extreme-stress situations, they said. * The JeM specialises in fidayeen actions and gives immense importance to religious indoctrination and ideological brainwashing, they said.

US 'very closely' following reports of F-16 misuse by Pakistan: State Dept - Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The US is ""very closely"" following the reports which have claimed that Pakistan misused American-made F-16 fighter jets against India in the recent aerial confrontation between the air forces of the two countries, a top State Department official has said. The Indian Air Force has displayed parts of an AMRAAM beyond visual range air-to-air missile as evidence to ""conclusively"" prove that Pakistan deployed US-manufactured F-16 fighter jets during an aerial raid targeting Indian military installations in Kashmir after India's anti-terror operation in Balakot. Pakistan has said that no F-16 fighter jets were used. The US State Department has said that America is seeking more information from Pakistan on the potential misuse of American-made F-16 fighter jets by it against India in violation of the end-user agreement. ""We've seen those reports and we're following that issue very closely,"" US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Robert Palladino told reporters at his biweekly news conference on Tuesday. He was responding to questions that Pakistan has violated the end-user agreement on F-16 that it procured from the United States. ""I can't confirm anything, but as a matter of policy, we don't publicly comment on the contents of bilateral agreements that we have in this regard involving US defence technologies nor the communications that we have with other countries about that. ""So, we're taking a look and we're going to continue to take a look. I'm going to leave it at that,"" Palladino said. AMRAAM missiles allow a fighter pilot to target an enemy aircraft that is beyond visual range, in day or night, and in all-weather conditions. They have an autonomous guidance capability, which allows the pilot to manoeuvre immediately after the missile's launch. Tensions between India and Pakistan flared up after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. India launched a counter-terror operation in Balakot on February 26.

They were earlier studying in private schools, we got them shifted to a nearby government school. If they will study in good government schools, they can get admission anywhere else in the future,"" Anjum said. E-rickshaw driver Kalua, who lives in Vikaspuri, said Kejriwal has delivered on the promises of electricity and water.  ""These are the most important needs for poor people like us. Lots of e-rickshaw drivers got subsidy. I haven't got it yet, but a lot of my friends have. Some of them even got it twice,"" he said.  Asked if the Centre had fulfilled the agenda of development, the 50-year-old said the BJP government is more into 'dadagiri' (coercion). ""They are useless, I don't even want to talk about them.

" After 94 days, India-Pakistan airspace entry points to reopen, but in phases | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Relief is in sight for international flyers and airlines. Entry points for aircraft crossing over between the Pakistan and Indian airspace will finally start reopening from Sunday evening — 94 days after all 11 of these points were closed on February 27 post the Balakot strike. The beginning is being made with an east-bound point Telem near Ahmedabad. This means a London-Delhi flight can overfly via this point. Telem will be the first entry point over land to reopen and then gradually, say sources, rest of the 10 points will allow access in phases in both directions — east to west and west to east. “One east-bound boundary point TELEM (near Ahmedabad) is being opened for flights from Pakistan airspace into Indian airspace from 5.30 pm (India time) on Sunday. Notice to airmen (Notam) are being issued both by India and Pakistan. Rest of points will be gradually opened in a phased manner,” said a senior official. Indian officials at this point are unable to give an exact timeframe as airspace of many countries are involved in this process like India, Pakistan, Muscat, Afghanistan and Iran. Resuming the direct route of pre-February 27 will mean changing course in airspace of all these countries from the path being followed during closure days. While it may happen over the next few days, a firm timeframe is being drawn up. India has informed the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation of its Air Force’s Friday decision of removing all temporary restrictions in our airspace since February 27. “The 11 points will have to be gradually reopened so that airlines can accordingly plan their flight routings,” said the official. Doing so suddenly could lead to the same chaos that was witnessed on February 27 when Pakistan closed its airspace for overflying and then flights enroute at that time had to suddenly re-route at the last minute. Many, including Air India’s US-Delhi nonstops had to take fuelling stops in the Gulf before taking the longer routes to India over the Arabian Ocean to Mumbai — far enough to avoid Pakistan’s Karachi airspace over the ocean — before heading to their destination. All the 11 points from where aircraft transit between India and Pakistan airspace were closed on February 27. Airlines have been losing money badly due to factors like extra fuel burn, crew requirement and fuelling stops. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
 Balakot biggest anti-terror operation in India's history: Rajnath | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Balakot air strikes on the Jaish-e-Muhammed terror training camp in Pakistan was the ""biggest"" anti-terrorist operation in the history of India, Union Home minister Rajnath Singh said in an election rally in south Delhi on Thursday. The senior BJP leader also slammed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi alleging that it did not fulfil its promises made to the people after coming to power in 2015. Singh lambasted the opposition parties for seeking to know the exact number of terrorists killed in the Indian Air Force strikes, days after the Pulwama attack in south Kashmir which claimed the loves of 40 CRPF personnel. ""They (opposition parties) say the air force should have counted the bodies. Being the home minister and having solid intelligence input, I can say with full conviction that the Balakot air strikes was the biggest anti-terrorist operation in the history of India,"" Singh claimed. He also asserted the air strikes was the biggest anti-terror operation in the world. India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stopped sending dossiers to Pakistan after terror attacks and now responds directly. ""The days of sending dossiers are gone, now we will ensure action against the terrorists,"" he told the rally in Badarpur area. Citing a report by an Italian journalist, he said 170 terrorists were killed in Balakot while several others were admitted to the local hospitals for treatment. Seeking vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate from South Delhi, Ramesh Bidhuri, Singh said his victory will ensure Modi again becomes Prime Minister of the country. Hitting out at the ruling AAP in Delhi, he said: ""There would be no crisis of water, electricity, schools and colleges, if it (AAP) had fulfilled its promises made to the people before coming to power."" ""Delhi will develop only after the AAP is finished in the next Assembly elections in the national capital,"" Singh said. He also slammed the Congress for its poll promise to scrap the sedition law, saying the BJP will strengthen it after coming back to power at the Centre. The image of India has been strengthened by the Modi government and the country is on the path of becoming 'dhanwan and Balwan' (rich and strong) nation, Singh said.

"When Opposition parties win, EVMs are perfect: Rajnath Singh - Times of India","MUMBAI: Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday came down on the Opposition, including Congress, for questioning the reliability of electronic voting machines (EVMs). At a public meeting at Nallasopara for BJP-Shiv Sena alliance candidate Rajendra Gavit, Singh said the NDA will win by three-fourth majority, so parties like Congress and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) were finding faults with EVMs. He said the Election Commission had cleared doubts about EVMs being tamper-proof. When these parties win in state elections, the EVMs are perfect, but when they lose, they blame it on the machines, he said at the meeting. Singh choose Nallasopara, one of six assembly segments of Palghar Lok Sabha constituency, as it has maximum voters (4.62 lakh of the constituency’s 18.12 lakh), of which over 22% are north Indian. On the Balakot attack and surgical strike, Singh said the latter had changed the way the international community looked at India. He said the brave never count the dead, only vultures do. Singh pointed to the around 4,000 crowd and asked if they had made up their minds on whom to vote for. He then told them to raise their hands and clap if they had decided to vote for the right party. Soon, the crowd erupted into slogans of ‘Modi’. On Sena-BJP differences on the seat (BJP had to give away its MP to Sena), Singh said the alliance was growing stronger and urged workers of both parties to stay united. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath was to address the meeting but sources said he was reluctant to campaign for ‘Sena candidate Gavit’ after campaigning for ‘BJP candidate Gavit’ in the May 2018 bypolls. Praising Modi, Singh said India had been shining globally and people abroad had also changed their views about the country. He said India will soon be among the top five countries. Lauding the Prime Minister’s housing scheme, Singh said it had crossed the one-crore mark and Jan Dhan Yogna accounts had also crossed 34 crores under the Modi regime. He that the government was constructing around 30km of ‘international highways’ across the country. Sena leader Eknath Shinde urged people against voting for the party supported by MNS chief Raj Thackeray. He said Raj had been known for his anti-north Indian campaign. In Palghar, Raj is supporting Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA)-Congress-NCP candidate Baliram Jadhav. Shinde said north Indians have been subject to Raj’s hatred in Mumbai and across the state. He said the only way to show MNS its place was by not voting for a party it supported. Download The Times of India News App for Latest Elections News."

The Pak army, in a press conference held to deny the Indian claims,   ended up admitting   that Indian fighter jets did drop four bombs. Though they were quick to deny claims of any damage. In a press conference detailing the Indian operation, director general, Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR), Major General Asif Ghafoor revealed how the Indian attack left Pakistan forces surprised. The Pak army spokesperson almost admitted that they were surprised by the air attack as he claimed ""on land our complete safeguards were on place, ground incursion would have been difficult for them."" The details provided by the DG, ISPR showed how the Indian Air Force operation flummoxed the Pakistan air force jets that were on combat air patrol (CAP) mission. Ghafoor said that Indian jets were first spotted on the radar in the Lahore-Sialkot sector and the first CAP mission scrambled to challenge it. ""A second formation of Indian jets then came close to Okara-Bahawalpur area of international border and the second CAP mission became airborne to counter it as per the SoP,"" he said. ""Our radars then picked a heavy formation in Muzaffarabad sector approaching from Kiran valley ... this was a heavy team, they crossed the LoC and came inside 4 to 5 nautical miles before being repulsed,"" Ghafoor said. ""While going back they jettisoned their payload and four bombs fell in Jabba, near the town of Balakot, causing no casualties or damage,"" he said. He claimed that the Indian planes were in Pakistan's airspace for ""just 4 minutes"" and went back when challenged by the Pakistani aircraft. During the press conference, the DG, ISPR was at loss of words to explain why the Pak forces did not shoot down the Indian jets.

Structured India-Pak engagement key to build edifice of durable peace: Pakistan - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan has said it was hoping for ""re-engagement"" with India after the Lok Sabha polls, noting that structured dialogue would enable the two countries to understand mutual concerns, resolve outstanding disputes and build the edifice of durable peace and security in the region. In an interview to PTI, Pakistan's outgoing high commissioner Sohail Mahmood said diplomacy and dialogue are indispensable to improve ties between the two neighbours. ""We hope for re-engagement after the elections in India. Diplomacy and dialogue are indispensable,"" he said. Tensions between the two countries worsened after the Pulwama terror attack and both the countries were almost on the brink of a war after India's military planes struck a terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26 and Pakistan carried out a counter-offensive the next day. Mahmood, who has been appointed as Pakistan's next foreign secretary said dialogue between India and Pakistan was the only option to understand mutual concerns and ensure peace, prosperity and security in the region. ""Sustained engagement and structured dialogue would enable the two countries to understand mutual concerns and differences, resolve outstanding disputes and build the edifice of durable peace, security and prosperity in the region,"" Mahmood said. He also said that there was a need to review the narrative about Pakistan in India. ""A narrative is needed that captures the reality in Pakistan objectively and more fully. A narrative that also helps recognise opportunities for peaceful, cooperative and good neighbourly relations,"" he said. ""We must strive for stable peace, equal security and shared prosperity for ourselves and the region,"" the envoy added. In signs of easing tensions, Pakistan around two weeks ago announced that it was releasing 360 Indian prisoners, mostly fishermen as a ""goodwill gesture"". The initiative was followed by Pakistan high commission here granting visas to 2,200 Sikh pilgrims from India to facilitate their participation in the annual Baisakhi celebrations in Pakistan. Over two weeks after the Balakot strike, India and Pakistan held talks to finalise the modalities for setting up a corridor linking the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan's Kartarpur with Gurdaspur district in Punjab. Asked about the Kartarpur corridor project, the Pakistani high commissioner said Islamabad was committed to completing the physical infrastructure on its side. ""The government of Pakistan is proceeding in full measures to complete the physical infrastructure on its side and it is hopeful that the modalities will be mutually agreed between the two sides in good time before November 2019,"" he said. Last November, both India and Pakistan agreed to set up the Kartarpur corridor to link the historic Gurdwara Darbar Sahib - the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev - to Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur. Kartarpur Sahib is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. The relations between India and Pakistan remained tense since 2016. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had travelled to Delhi to attend Modi's oath-taking ceremony and the Indian premier had in December 2015 made a stopover in Lahore to greet his counterpart on his birthday.

 CoI into helicopter crash in Budgam: Commanding officer of IAF's Srinagar base shifted | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force has transferred the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) of the Srinagar base in the midst of a court of inquiry probing the crash of an Mi-17 helicopter in Kashmir during a standoff with Pakistan on February 27, according to official sources. The senior-most official of the strategic base was removed to ensure impartial probe into the crash, the sources said Tuesday. The helicopter crashed in Budgam on February 27 when Indian and Pakistani fighter jets were engaged in a fierce aerial combat, a day after India's airstrike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot. The Pakistani Air Force had unsuccessfully attempted to target various Indian military installations in Kashmir on February 27. Sources said the CoI was also probing whether the helicopter crashed after being accidentally hit by the IAF's air defence system, which was on highest alert following the Balakot strikes. They said the IAF will initiate action based on the report of the CoI which may include slapping of criminal case against those found guilty. There have been reports that the helicopter was hit by IAF's own air defence system. However, the IAF is yet to make any official comment on the issue. The sources said the CoI was specifically probing whether a surface-to-air missile of IAF hit the chopper and whether the Identification of Friend or Foe (IFF) system on board the helicopter was switched off.

" Balakot operation: If we had Rafale fighters, we would have performed even better, says IAF chief | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Reiterating that the Indian Air Force outgunned the Pakistan Air Force during the Balakot strikes and the subsequent dogfight over the Line of Control in February, Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa on Monday said his force would have performed even better if the Rafale fighters had been inducted on time. The IAF chief said his force had “successfully” conducted the pre-dawn air strikes at the main Jaish-e-Mohammed facility at Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province on February 26, which led to the aerial skirmish a day later after PAF launched “a riposte” with a strike package of 11 F-16s as well as 13 JF-17s and Mirage-III/Vs to bomb Indian military targets. “Did they succeed in their objective? The answer is a clear `No’, as the attack was thwarted, while we had achieved our objective in Balakot. This is the main argument. Yes, we lost an aircraft, a MiG-21 Bison and one of our pilots was held captive (Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was later released),” said ACM Dhanoa, speaking at the Marshal of Air Force Arjan Singh centenary seminar on aerospace power here. “But we got an aircraft too, which electronic signatures suggest was an F-16. But to shift the narrative to this air combat from not being able to achieve your military objective is obfuscating the issue, like the statements made by Pakistan after the 1965 and 1971 wars … You (Pakistan) lost half your country, for God’s sake,” he added. ACM Dhanoa said IAF had launched precision stand-off weapons (Spice-2000 bombs) with “great accuracy” at the Balakot terror facility since it had technology on its side, and had also “come out better” in the subsequent aerial skirmish because it had upgraded its MiG-21 Bisons and Mirage-2000s. “The results would have been further skewed in our favour had we inducted our Rafale aircraft in time,” he said, adding the proposed induction of the 36 French fighters (for Rs 59,000 crore) and five squadrons of the Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems (for Rs 40,000 crore) over the next two to four years would “once again tilt the technological balance in our favour”. Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman has accused the previous UPA regime for “wasting 10 critical years” by sitting on the proposed procurement for Rafale fighters. But the Congress has alleged the 36-Rafale deal inked by the NDA government in September 2016 was vastly overpriced, violated defence procurement procedures, included no transfer of technology, and was intended to benefit the Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Defence as the “offsets partner” of the French fighter manufacturer Dassault Aviation. The NDA government, on its part, asserts it secured a “better deal” for the 36 Rafales in terms of price, capability, equipment, delivery and maintenance than the one “notionally being negotiated” by the previous UPA regime for 126 Rafale jets under the now-scrapped MMRCA (medium multi-role combat aircraft) project.

The IAF document corroborates a series of TOI reports, ranging from the successful use of Spice-2000 precision guided penetration bombs by Mirage-2000 fighters in the February 26 pre-dawn air strikes to the simultaneous deployment of a ‘decoy package’ of Sukhoi-30MKI jets ostensibly headed towards the JeM headquarters in Bahawalpur that lured Pakistani combat air patrols away from the actual ‘strike package’. According to sources, the document, which includes various lessons learnt, said the Spice-2000 bombs with penetration warheads hit five of six “designated mean points of impact” on the buildings within the JeM facility to achieve “complete and total strategic surprise”. The Spice-2000 bombs, pre-fed with “digital scene-matching area correlators”, pierced the roofs to kill all the “soft-skinned” inmates inside with shock and blast waves, without much external damage. But no accurate assessment of the casualties was possible, the review said. Sources also said if fragmentation bombs had been used to flatten the buildings, probably the scepticism shown by some international media organisations about the effectiveness of the air strikes would have been curbed. But heavy cloud cover during the strikes ensured that neither could the Mirage-2000s use their entire weapons packages, which included AGM-142 Crystal Maze missiles, nor did the IAF get clear video footage of the destruction. Better evidence would have been possible if the Crystal Maze missiles, with their data links and live video feeds, had been used. “There could have been better weapon-to-target matching and clear video footage to win the propaganda war as well,” a source said.

"Nirmala Sitharaman: ‘On the ground, Balakot airstrikes are striking a chord with people’ | - Times of India","Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman speaks to Diwakar and Rajeev Deshpande on India’s military action in Pakistan, Rafale and moreThere has been strong focus on national security in BJP’s campaign. There is a view that issues like Balakot may have peaked and more ordinary bread-and-butter matters are on the voter’s mind...May be so among the talking classes. But as we attend rallies and roadshows, we see that even when we are underlining all that we have done in the last five years, chits come from the crowd — not from the dais — saying ‘tell us more about Balakot, tell us about surgical strikes and if Pakistan will face more pressure’. So, I feel, at the ground level, even in the south, Balakot airstrikes and Pakistan seem to be touching a chord. It is on top of the agenda. Has there been a militarisation of political rhetoric?I wouldn’t think so. However, there is a view that India was soft on many issues till now and the decisiveness with which action has been taken to hit at terror is a good thing. We are not trying to politicise the armed forces. If a government has taken a call on putting into action its belief that there should be zero tolerance to terror, why should we hesitate to talk about it? We are saying this is different from the response of (UPA) post-Mumbai. This government, post-Uri in 2016 and now post-Pulwama, is acting with the hope that if we hit at terror nerve centres, there will be a change in the attitude of the perpetrators. The PM has been saying, ‘I have given the armed forces the right to decide their response’. That conviction, recognition to the armed forces, was absent in the previous government. So, we would certainly like to talk about it. I know you have been asked this before, but can the casualties in the Jaish camp be ascertained?Maybe not from my side, or the Indian side! Of course, there are ways to establish it…. I dare say this is not a secret. Before February 25 itself, in Pakistan, there were public calls to join as recruits. The madrassa (at Balakot) was only a front. All this was in public domain. If someone looks at this, the numbers are easy to arrive at. Your comment on reports that India had warned Pakistan of further military action if Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was not returned safely.I may not be able to elaborate on discussions, or to use your words ‘warning’, but we were very clear that Abhinandan had to come back. The PM has referred to reports that US conveyed to Pakistan India was keeping missiles in readiness.That no harm should come to Abhinandan was clearly our position. It is not for me to elaborate on what the PM has said. There has been a lot of questioning of the air action of Feb 27. Do we have evidence to establish that a PAF F-16 was brought down?Not only do we have technical evidence, this has also been put out too. The arsenal used by F-16s was displayed by us. This established use of the armament and use of F-16s. Then, we gave out details of electronic signatures of aircraft that came into Indian territory. There has not been any credible refutation. The evidence cannot be questioned, it is rudimentary for defence experts. We did knock down an F-16. Allegations about the Rafale deal are a challenge to the Modi govt’s ‘clean’ image. In the latest episode before the SC, it is claimed that internal warnings and dissent notes were overridden.These claims are not new. They said you paid more than we did. Theirs was a non-deal. We said our terms were 9% cheaper, CAG said it was 2.86%. So, on price, both SC and CAG held our deal as better. On process, the Indian negotiating team had different sittings to talk about pricing. During discussions, each member voices a different opinion. Every opinion is recorded. Finally, one opinion, all of them join in, is decided. There are no ‘dissenting notes’ inbuilt in the system technically. The individual who held a different opinion in the end signed the cabinet note. The SC has gone through this process.

" Scare in air: India, Pakistan scramble jets | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: India scrambled fighters after radars detected a Pakistani drone near the international border in the Khemkaran sector of Punjab in the early hours of Monday. Though Pakistan too scrambled jets in response, there was no airspace violation from either side and tensions quietened down soon after. With both sides maintaining high operational readiness all along borders, even as they engage in fierce firing duels across the 778-km long LoC in J&K, defence sources said the alarm bells in India's air defence network sounded around 3am on Monday when ""a large Pakistani unmanned aerial vehicle"" was detected in Khemkaran sector. The IAF swung into action by scrambling two Sukhoi-30MKI fighters from the Halwara airbase, which led to Pakistan dispatching two F-16s to the border region. ""The Pakistani UAV was picked up by both Army units and IAF's mobile observation flights,"" a source said. There have been regular intrusions by Pakistani UAVs, and at least four of them were shot down by Indian forces, ever since the IAF conducted pre-dawn air strikes on a Jaish-e-Muhammed terror facility at Balakot in Pakistan on February 26. A day later, Pakistan had retaliated by sending a 'strike package' of 24 fighters, including F-16s, JF-17s and Mirage-5 jets, to target Indian military installations across the LoC. Though IAF foiled the attempt, it lost a MiG-21 being flown by Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman just after he shot down an F-16. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."
UK mayor starts petition for Air India Mumbai-Birmingham flight | Mumbai News - Times of India,"A regional mayor has launched a petition addressed to Air India and the Government of India calling for the national flag carrier to introduce direct flights between Birmingham and Mumbai. West Midlands mayor Andy Street CBE, former managing director of British department store John Lewis, together with the West Midlands Combined Authority, launched the petition called, 'We need a direct flight to Mumbai from Birmingham' on change.org three days ago. It is quite unusual for a British mayor to start a petition and address it to a sovereign government. Approximately 500,000 PIOs live in the Midlands, with a significant number in Birmingham, Leicester, Northampton, Nottingham, Sandwell and Wolverhampton. There is a direct flight between Birmingham and Delhi, but Air India has never operated one between Birmingham and Mumbai. UK passengers currently have to make the 185km journey to London Heathrow to fly direct to Mumbai on either British Airways or Air India. Jet Airways used to operate a direct flight to Mumbai from Manchester - 140km from Birmingham - but that stopped when the airline collapsed. The Tory mayor has written a message on the petition stating: ""If people need to go to Mumbai they have to travel to Heathrow. Given the significant business (Jaguar Land Rover, JCB, Rolls Royce, Bharat Forge, Pattonair and Bombardier to name a few) links between the Midlands and India, and the strength of the diaspora, there is strong demand for a direct flight between Birmingham and Mumbai."" Street led a ministerial trade delegation to Delhi in October calling for an increase in flights between the Midlands and India. During that trip, he met civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu. TOI contacted WMCA who confirmed the petition was genuine. More than 700 people, mostly PIOs, have signed it, stating the route would enable them to avoid the hassle, time and expense of travelling to London and some are unhappy with the Air India connections from Delhi. One wrote: ""I have a very big family that lives in Leicester and it would be good for them to catch a flight from Birmingham rather than Heathrow."" Debashis Golder, Air India regional manager, UK & Europe, said he had not been contacted by Street about the demand. ""Services are decided ultimately by our market planning in our head office who, based on market analysis and route economics, start new services or put additional services in the overall commercial consideration of the network plan,"" he said. British Sikh MP Preet Gill, who represents Birmingham Edgbaston, said: ""We need Birmingham Amritsar reinstated first."" Air India stopped the Birmingham-Amritsar and Birmingham-Delhi routes in February after the closure of Pakistan airspace following the Balakot airstrike. Birmingham-Delhi resumed by March-end and Golder says Amritsar should resume in July, or earlier, subject to aircraft availability and the opening of airspace above Pakistan completely.

"PM revealing details of a sensitive military operation is a poll code violation, CPM writes to EC - Times of India","NEW DELHI: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury has written to the Election Commission against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly violating the poll code by sharing operational details of a ""sensitive"" defence mission in a television interview to influence voters. In his letter to the EC, Yechury has alleged Modi's statements were in clear and deliberate violation of the guidelines which were re-issued and reiterated by the Election Commission before the first round of polling, making it clear that the armed forces, which belong to all of India, cannot be a subject for hyperbolic and false claims by any party. In an interview on Saturday, PM Modi had said he approved the Indian Air Force's cross-border mission in Balakot, Pakistan, despite inclement weather and against the advice of experts as he felt cloud cover would hide the Indian fighter jets from Pakistani radar. Modi said he relied on his ""raw wisdom"" to dispel the doubts of the defence experts who had planned the mission. ""I am surprised that the country's pundits who abuse me never figured this out,"" he said, referring to rain on the night of the air strike. The CPM general secretary said, ""This interview wherein Modi gave out operational details of a sensitive military mission, with a purpose to influence the voters during the silent period of the campaign needs to be recorded and acted upon by the Commission. ""It appears that Modi is mocking the Election Commission by violating all rules, codes and guidelines with impunity with damaging consequences for our democracy, of which the Election Commission is the custodian. We hope that you will uphold the prestige, honour and credibility of the Election Commission and initiate action against Modi,"" he said. Yechury further said based on the poll body's recent decisions on BJP leaders and Prime Minister Narendra Modi making alleged poll code violations earlier, it was ""widely perceived"" that PM Modi was being treated as though he was outside the purview of the Model Code of Conduct. Yechury further lashed out at PM Modi for continuing to use the armed forces in his speech. In an election rally in Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday, the Prime Minister is reported to have said, ""Today terrorists were killed by our Army in Kashmir. Now some people are worried as to why did Modi kill the terrorists when voting is underway? An armed terrorist is attacking, do my jawans go to the Election Commission to seek permission to kill him?"" ""Note: He (Modi) claims that he killed the terrorists not our armed forces!"" Yechury said. The Left leader pointed out that similar ""violations"" have been brought to the notice of the EC earlier too. ""The commission, however, seems to think that Modi and Shri Amit Shah are above the electoral process and the Model code of Conduct does not apply to them. This has been noted by myriad cartoonists, newspaper editorials and commentators. I hope that the Election Commission will now prove them wrong and initiate prompt and suitable action against Modi,"" he said.

 CPM knocks EC's door as PM Modi asks first-time voters to vote for Balakot strike men | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: The CPM wrote to the Election Commission on Tuesday alleging violation of the poll panel's directive after Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a rally in Maharashtra asked first-time voters to dedicate their votes to the brave men who carried out the air strike in Pakistan's Balakot. In the letter, the party's politburo member Nilotpal Basu urged the poll panel to ""strongly initiate"" appropriate action to stop the pre-election atmosphere from being vitiated, which is fast degenerating towards polarisation. ""With deep anguish we are drawing your attention to the latest violation of Model Code of Conduct (MCC) by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. He is also violating the specific direction of the Election Commission to refrain from invoking the armed forces for seeking votes,"" Basu wrote. Addressing an election rally in Maharashtra's Latur, Modi said, ""I want to tell the first time voters, can you dedicate your first vote to the the brave men who carried out the airstrike in Pakistan's Balakot? ""Can your first vote be dedicated to the brave martyrs of the Pulwama (terror attack)?"" The Election Commission had last month asked all political parties to desist from using photographs of defence personnel as part of their election propaganda or campaigning. The CPM has also drawn the poll body's attention to the ""brazenly provocative"" statement of Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. ""In his election campaign he asserted that they did not need votes from those wearing 'dhothis and lungis' alluding to linguistic and religious minorities in the state. The situation in Assam is quite vulnerable. A custodial death took place in the Goalpara detention camp run by the state government. ""The detention camps for so called doubtful voters were to be dismantled as per BJP's electoral commitments. However, not only has this assurance not implemented, but new camps have come up notwithstanding the process of Supreme Court monitored up-gradation of National Register of Citizens,"" Basu wrote. Accusing the poll body of not dealing with earlier complaints with ""firmness"", the Left leader said that even the case of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who called the Army ""Modiji ki sena"", was treated ""lightly"". ""We urge you to strongly initiate appropriate action to stop the pre-election atmosphere from being vitiated which is fast degenerating towards polarization based on identity and assertion of national symbol for partisan electoral interests,"" he said.

Abhinandan Varthaman: Wing Commander Abhinandan posted at Suratgarh Air Force Base | Jaipur News - Times of India,"JAIPUR: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by the Pakistan Army on February 27 and kept in captivity for nearly 60 hours, has now been posted to Suratgarh Air Force Base in Rajasthan. He took over his assigned duties there on Saturday. This is not the IAF officer’s first tenure in Rajasthan as previously he had also served in Bikaner. Son of an IAF personnel, has also studied in the state when his father was posted here. However, the IAF has not confirmed the Wing Commander’s current posting and an official said, “All defence postings are confidential and the only detail that we can confirm is that Wing Commander Abhinandan has been posted in Rajasthan. Further details cannot be divulged.” Meanwhile, local sources in Suratgarh told TOI that Abhinandan has joined the IAF station there. “Suratgarh Air Force Base has MiG-21 Bison aircraft and at this point it is not clear if Abhinandan will get back to flying since as per the protocol, once a pilot ejects, he is grounded. Having said that, the Wing Commander’s case might be looked at differently,” added an officer. This is the officer’s first posting after his return from Pakistan. Just a week back, a video of the Wing Commander had surfaced where he was seen interacting with the defence personnel at previous place of posting in J&K. Abhinandan was captured by the Pakistani army on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during an aerial combat. He took down an F-16 fighter of Pakistan before his plane was hit. He was handed over to India on March 1 following which he underwent debriefing process and was given sick leave. Wing Commander Abhinandan had to be hospitalized after he sustained injuries during his captivity in Pakistan. He was being treated at the Army’s Research and Referral Hospital in Delhi.

 Air Force looks at buying advanced 'bunker buster' version of Spice-2000 bombs | India News - Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Buoyed by its success in the Balakot air strikes against a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Pakistan, the Indian Air Force is now planning to buy an advanced version of the Spice-2000 bomb, which can completely destroy buildings and bunkers. During the Balakot strikes, the Air Force had dropped Spice-2000 bombs from Mirage-2000 fighter aircraft after a pack of 12 of these fighters crossed the Line of Control to strike the Jaish facility in the Khyber Pakhtunwa province in Pakistan. However, the Spice-2000 bombs used in the Balakot strikes were the penetrator version which made holes using their weight in the concrete rooftops of the buildings in the Jaish camp which don't destroy buildings but explode inside killing people with the mix of 70-80 kg explosives with shrapnel. ""The IAF is now planning to acquire the bunker buster or the building destroyer version with Mark 84 warhead which can decimate targeted buildings,"" government sources told ANI. The acquisition is likely to be done through the emergency powers granted to the three services for buying any equipment of their choice worth up to Rs 300 crore to prepare for any hostilities, they said. Under the powers, the Army has already made up its mind to buy Spike anti-tank guided missiles deployment against any possible armoured threat posed by the enemy troops. The Spice-2000 bombs have been acquired from Israel which is one of the main weapon and ammunition supplier of the Air Force. The Balakot air strikes were conducted by the Air Force in response to the Pulwama terrorist attack on a CRPF convoy in which 44 personnel lost their lives.

 513 ceasefire violations by Pakistan post Balakot strike: Army | India News - Times of India,"JAMMU: As many as 513 ceasefire violations by Pakistan have taken place along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir in the past one-and-a-half month and the Pakistan Army has suffered five to six times more casualties than the Indian Army in the retaliatory action, a senior officer said Saturday. The Pakistan Army also used heavy weaponry like mortars and artillery guns in over 100 times during these violations and targeted civilian areas but was given a befitting response by the Indian Army, General Officer Commanding (GOC) of White Knight Corps Lt Gen Paramjit Singh told reporters in Rajouri. ""Almost 513 ceasefire violations happened in the past one-and-a-half month and over 100 times during these violations, the Pakistan Army used heavy weapons like mortars and artillery guns and targeted civilian areas. Only yesterday (Friday), four civilians, including two girls, were injured in Poonch,"" the GOC said. However, he said the Pakistan Army is being given a befitting response by the Indian Army. Responding to a question about the casualties suffered by Pakistan in the retaliatory action, he said unlike the Indian Army, Pakistan does not announce the number of its casualties. ""However, as per our sources, the Pakistan Army suffered five to six times more casualties than the casualties on our side,"" Lt Gen Singh said. Ten people, including four security personnel, have been killed and nearly 45 others, mostly civilians, injured in the twin districts since India's preemptive air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26 in response to the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. On the sniping incidents from across the border, Lt Gen Singh said such incidents had come to naught over the past several months, especially after the Balakot strike. ""Some incidents of sniping took place earlier and accordingly we have taken some measures to strengthen our defence. As per the data this year, only three incidents of sniping by the Pakistan Army were reported from January to February 26 in which one of the fatalities include a civilian porter,"" he said. ""There was no sniping incident from February 27 till date, which means the steps taken by us have been successful,"" the officer said. He said the morale of the troops is very high and as long as they are deployed on the borders, the people of the country need not worry. ""They have every kind of weaponry and explosives with them and their resolve is rock solid and always prepared for any challenge. As long as they are on the border, you are safe,"" he said. Responding to a question, the officer said, ""Our message to Pakistan is given every day whenever some nefarious activity happens on the border.""

Yogi Adityanath: We’re working with a 74-plus seat target in UP | - Times of India,"Early on Sunday morning, as Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath switches from one meeting to another and attends calls at his official residence in Lucknow, news of Rahul Gandhi contesting from Wayanad pours in. 'It is an insult to Amethi if he is also contesting from Wayanad,' Yogi tells TOI. In a free-flowing interview, he talks about the SP-BSP gathbandhan and its plan to kick off its campaign from Deoband. He also takes on Congress which is trying to make a spirited comeback in UP as he lays down his development agenda, including the grand Kumbh Mela he had organised. Excerpts ...How many seats do you think BJP will win in UP?We are working with a target of 74-plus seats and we will win as many. Who have you left the remaining for…?We haven't left any. When I say 74-plus, it means up to 80. Do you think BJP will gain seats after the Balakot strikes?After Balakot, expectations of people from (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji and BJP have gone up. People believe that BJP can respond to terror. There is no doubt that the government under Modi, on every front, has given an exemplary performance and the attraction of the common man towards Modi has definitely grown. Since 1947, the northeast had become highly sensitive. For months, it was under curfew. Different groups had stunted development of the region. After coming to power, Modiji prepared a plan for it. He appointed a minister in-charge for each state and told them to spend at least three days a month there. There is so much change there now. The northeast has entered a new phase of development. Separatist groups, which were challenging the unity of the country, were immobilised in the first surgical strike in Myanmar. Separatist camps were destroyed after our jawans were attacked in a surgical strike and there is peace in there, along with development. Then there was the second surgical strike in Uri and now, after Pulwama, people have greater expectations. The action was necessary and as per expectations of the people. If terrorism tries to dent the security of this country and its sovereignty, we will give it a befitting reply. And we have shown that we can do it. Lok Sabha Election: Complete coverageBut do you think you will benefit from this by gaining seats?The NDA government is successfully completing five years in power. There can be no accusation of any kind against it or its members. There is no anti-incumbency. Even before the February-end air strike, people across the country used to say that their first choice for the post of PM is Modji. I agree the media's viewpoint changed after the air strike. Many say PM Modi and you are a combination of Hinduvta and development…We all want to take forward development and administration as our poll issues. We talk of development projects as Saubhagaya, Ujjwala, Kisan Nidhi and Kumbh. Congress ke log mandir mandir bhatak rahe hai. Akhilesh Yadav ne kaha hum duryodhan ki murti lagayenge. Toh soch jiski jitni hogi, utna hi karega. Mai Rahul Gandhi ki baat kar raha hoo. Nakal ke liye bhi akal chahiye (Congress leaders are visiting temples. Akhilesh Yadav has said he will build a statue of Duryodhan. People are driven by the type of mindsets they have. As for Rahul, I feel even to copy others one needs intellect). SP and BSP announced they will start their first joint rally from Deoband on April 7. You started with Shakumbhri Dham in Saharanpur...In the state, the first phase of elections begin from west UP and Saharanpur is the beginning point and nerve centre of that region. If they have their faith in Deoband, we have our faith in Ma Shakumbhari. Which is why we started our campaign from that 'dham'. We talked of our development plans. People have witnessed misrule by Congress, SP and BSP and how they used caste-based politics to be in power. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi included Maa Vindhyavasini Temple in Mirzapur, Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi and Hanumangarhi in Ayodhya…Acchi baat hai ki Modiji ke bhay se inhe ishwar aur prabhu yaad aa rahe hai (It is good that fear of Modiji's has made them god-fearing). This is the same Congress which submitted an affidavit in Supreme Court in 2005 saying that Ram and Krishna do not exist. We are glad that at least PM Modi has forced them to turn into believers Priyanka-Rahul-Congress on one side and SP-BSP on other. Which is more challenging?In 2017, it's Priyanka Gandhi who brought two boys together. Logo ne khaarij kiya. Chahe woh bua-babua ka ho chahe bhaibehan ka ho. Uttar Pradesh ki janta jaanti hai asliyat (People did not accept Priyanka's bringing together of Rahul and Akhilesh. Be it a coming together of aunt and nephew or brother and sister, people of UP know their true colours). Rahul Gandhi is contesting from both Amethi and Wayanad...If Rahul Gandhi is going to Wayanad, it's an insult to Amethi. It's a seat that has been nurtured by his family for four generations. He no longer is in control of Amethi. He is now looking for a safe passage. SP-BSP alliance is not only unprecedented but come with a huge voter base of Yadavs, Muslims and Dalits. Do you agree there is a big challenge from them?In 2014, BSP was reduced to zero in Lok Sabha. Akhilesh Yadav played a clever game by joining hands with BSP so that he can save his skin and use Dalit votes to win a few seats. BSP will again return with zero seats. In 2017, you talked about bringing in anti-Romeo squads and raked up issues of boundary walls outside kabrastan (cemetery). Now these issues do not exist...These were not poll issues. It was required to fix these concerns and we did that after coming to power. Now, the money that was being used for graveyards is also going to shamshan ghats (crematoria). We have restored dignity of women and girls in two years. Ram Mandir has always been part of most poll speeches. Will it be Balakot or Ram Mandir this time?Our issue is development and security. We have given priority to both internal and border security. Ram Mandir was never a poll issue. It is a matter of faith. Complete coverage: Lok Sabha electionsThere are comparisons between you and PM Modi. Many in BJP believe you could be his successor...Modiji humare neta hain, margdarshak hain. Unki prerna se hume safalta prapat ho rahi hai. Poora desh Modiji ke saath khada hai. Unhi ke leadrship mai chunaav lad rahe hai (Modiji is our leader and he shows us the way. It's his inspiration that is getting us success. The entire country is with Modiji and we are fighting this election under his leadership) In a recently held rally, you termed Imran Masood as ""damaad"" of Masood Azhar…I didn't take any names but certainly Congress leaders have no respect for senior leaders of the country and party leaders use foul language for the Prime Minister. Congress party takes name of most wanted terrorist Masood Azhar respectfully using ""ji"".

Addressing the media, Dhanoa had said fighter pilots had hit the target given to them, adding that he could not give the number of casualties suffered as it is for the government to clarify. Earlier on Sunday, BJP chief Amit Shah, while addressing a rally in Ahmedabad, had claimed that 250 terrorists were killed in the air strike. India carried out the operation 12 days after 40 CRPF personnel were killed when a JeM suicide bomber attacked their convoy in Pulwama. Hours after the air raid on February 26, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale had told the media that IAF fighter planes hit the largest militant camp ofÃ‚Â JeMÃ‚Â at Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, eliminating a large number of Jaish terrorists and training commanders.

" Day after the Balakot attacks, India continues its diplomatic outreach | India News - Times of India","A day after the Balakot attacks, India has continued its diplomatic outreach, which will peak with foreign minister Sushma Swaraj delivering the inaugural address at the OIC plenary on March 1 in Abu Dhabi. With Pakistan sending its Air Force fighters into India, the running thread in statements from different countries is a call to ""de-escalate"" and ""restraint"". US secretary of state Mike Pompeo offered support by emphasising the ""close security partnership and shared goal of maintaining peace and security in the region"" in his statement. ""I expressed to both ministers that we encourage India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, and avoid escalation at any cost. I also encouraged both ministers to prioritize direct communication and avoid further military activity."" However, the very fact that the US described the Balakot strikes as ""counter-terrorism actions"" by India indicates that the US is not looking at India as the aggressor. Pompeo also said he had told Pakistan to avoid ""military action, and the urgency of Pakistan taking meaningful action against terrorist groups..."" The Modi government, top-level sources said, has continued to speak to different countries about the strikes and the Indian thinking that went behind them. The key points being made by Indian diplomats, foreign minister and other top-level officials is this - first, establishing the close connection between Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Pulwama terror attack; second, the connections between JeM and Pakistan's military-intelligence complex. The Indian side said they have conveyed that India would do what it takes to combat terrorism, even if it means unilateral actions. Sources said, this has become more important given the prospect of US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Sources who are top level interlocutors said India has received the most support from western countries. ""They have a keener sense of the terrorism threat that we're facing,"" they said. India has also received support and understanding, they said, from key Islamic countries, particularly Saudi Arabia and UAE. But Pakistan's violation of the LoC on Wednesday sent everyone scrambling to ask for de-escalation and cessation of military activity. British PM Theresa May Also called for restraint between Pakistan and India, saying, ""We are working closely with international partners including through the UN Security Council to de-escalate tensions."" Indian officials said they had pointed out that the UK almost went to war with Russia when double agent, Sergei Skripal, was poisoned with a nerve agent. France, which is working in the UN Security Council to put JeM chief Masood Azhar under sanctions, also expressed concern at military operations this morning. ""France is concerned about the deterioration of the situation. It calls on Pakistan and India for de-escalation."" Russian president's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov called on ""India and Pakistan for restraint in connection with the border incident"". The EU high representative, Frederica Mogherini, while also calling for de-escalation, said, ""Terrorism can never be justified. I spoke a few days ago by telephone with the foreign minister of Pakistan, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, to emphasise the need to continue to address terrorism, including clear and targeted actions related to all forms of terrorist activity"".

Amit Shah: Only Modi govt can give befitting reply to Pakistan | India News - Times of India,"AGRA: Pitching the Lok Sabha polls as an election for rooting out terrorism and giving a befitting reply to Pakistan, BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday said only a government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi can do it. Addressing a ""Vijay Sankalp"" rally, his first after the Lok Sabha poll schedule was announced on March 10, he said the alliance led by opposition parties cannot secure the country and only a Modi-led BJP government can do so. He accused Congress president Rahul Gandhi of insulting the valour of armed forces by questioning the air strikes on a terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot. ""How low will you stoop for vote-bank politics? Don't play with national security for vote bank, Rahul Gandhi,"" he said. The Congress has been accusing the BJP of politicising the air strikes. Shah also hit out at Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav and Congress leader Sam Pitroda for their controversial comments on the Pulwama terror attack and the subsequent air strikes. Targeting opposition leaders like BSP supremo Mayawati, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, DMK president M K Stalin and TMC's Mamata Banerjee, he said they are ""dreaming"" to remove Modi but don't have the guts to fight the Lok Sabha polls. Shah also spoke at length about welfare initiatives of the Modi government and said the general election is also about the development of 50 crore poor people. He claimed that people have decided to discard caste politics and vote Modi to power with a mandate bigger than what he got in 2014 due to his politics of ""sabka saath, sabka vikas"". Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 MPs to the 543-member Lok Sabha, is crucial to the BJP's bid to retain power at the Centre. It had won 71 and its ally Apna Dal two seats in 2014, making up for a little over 25 per cent of the 282 seats the saffron party had won. In 2019, it is a formidable alliance of SP and BSP in the upcoming polls. The BJP said it organised over 200 ""Vijay Sankalp"" (pledge for victory) rallies across the country on Sunday. While Shah addressed a rally in Agra, other top party leaders, including Union minister Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman, addressed public meetings at different places. The party said in a statement that Singh, Swaraj and Sitharaman spoke at Lucknow, Noida and Hyderabad respectively while Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh addressed rallies in Saharanpur and Bhopal respectively. Adityanath also spoke in Agra. The BJP said it will hold over 250 such rallies on Tuesday. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News."

"Arun Jaitley:   India won't play on back foot against terror, our security doctrine has changed, says Arun Jaitley | India News - Times of India","NEW DELHI: Union minister Arun Jaitley on Friday slammed   Indian Overseas Congress chief Sam Pitroda   for his comments on IAF's air strike on a terror camp in Balakot following the Pulwama attack, terming his statement as ""unfortunate"" and a ""blessing for Pakistan's narrative"". If the 'guru' (teacher) has such thinking, then one can imagine how his student would be, Jaitley said hitting out at remarks of Pitroda, who is a close aide of Congress president Rahul Gandhi. 'Natural habitat of terror apologists': PM slams opposition, Congress for insulting armed forcesJaitley said the fight against terror cannot be won by playing on the back foot and India's security doctrine had evolved to a point where it does not just defend itself, but can also go to the origin of terror and make a pre-emptive strike. ""The security doctrine of India has changed now. We attack at the point of origin of terror now. This is now an ideological battle between those who want to defend India using all possible measures or those who want to fight for India with their hands tied behind their back,"" Jaitley said. ""There is no country that has criticised the surgical strikes or the air strikes conducted by India except for one nation, Pakistan. The fact that senior Congress leaders are speaking the same language is unfortunate and also hurts the sentiments of the country. To say that the Pulwama attack was self-engineered is a blessing for Pakistan's narrative,"" he said.

He had also said he wanted to ""know more"" about the Balakot air attack and number of terrorists killed in it. Saying that Pitroda's statement was ""erroneous"", Jaitley asserted that it was based on the assumption that Pakistan state actors and non-state actors were different. ""It is unfortunate for India that somebody who is an ideologue of the Congress has said so. I think such people have no connect with India's security requirement, the sentiment of India and Indian forces, and the pain and loss that we have suffered in last three decades due to terrorism,"" he said. ""Their (Pakistan's) reaction to terror attacks has pointed out that non-state attackers are just an extended limb to the state actors of Pakistan,"" Jaitley told reporters on the sidelines of a function where former cricketer Gautam Gambhir joined the BJP.
